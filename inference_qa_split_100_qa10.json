Some of these techniques include water electrolysis [1], natural gas reforming [2], coal gasification [3], etc. Although some of these methods, such as water electrolysis, are efficient in terms of hydrogen recovery, there has been considerable interest in developing a desirable method for the next generation of energy sources because of its environmentally friendly manner. However, the method is cost prohibitive and requires an energy intensive process. In addition, it makes them unsuitable for large scale hydrogen production. For efficient water cleavage, the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor needs to be positioned at a more negative potential than the reduction potential of water, i.e. E current < E reduction (H2/H+), whereas the valence band needs to be positioned at a more positive potential than the oxidation reaction, i.e. E voltage > E oxidation (OH\u2212/O2). Although strong efforts have been made to develop appropriate semiconductors [4,5], there is no material that can simultaneously and efficiently oxidize and reduce water without external assistance. H2O+energy(solar)\u2192H2+1/2O2(PECreactor) A photoelectrochemical cell combines visible light harvesting by a nanocrystalline semiconductor thin film with the electrolysis of water. Photons with energies higher than the band gap of the semiconductor generates electron\u2013hole pairs in the conduction and valence bands. At the semiconductor surface, holes oxidize water to oxygen, whereas the photo-excited conduction band electrons are transferred to the counter-electrode of the PEC cell, and reduce water to form hydrogen gas [6\u20138]. These devices, however, have very low conversion efficiencies because most of the semiconductors used for this application have a large energy band gap. Furthermore, the band edge potentials of many semiconductors are unsuitable for oxygen and hydrogen evolution. To split water, a voltage of at least 1.2 eV is required. On the other hand, the dye-sensitized solar cell in the current study consisted of a parallel module, and the system did not exceed the maximum voltage of 0.8 eV [9\u201313]. Therefore, an efficient hydrogen production system requires a serially connected unit cell system to achieve the required voltage, \u223c2.0 eV or more [14,15]. Although this can be achieved easily in the case of a silicon solar cell, which has achieved more than 18% efficiency, the cost of silicon solar cells is too expensive and they are inflexible. Therefore, the race to the development of hydrogen technology has expanded worldwide [16,17]. By Deng et al. [18], a hybrid amorphous silicon/photoelectrochemical multi-junction cell for hydrogen production was designed, and resulted that the triple-junction amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cells exhibited photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies up to 12.7% and open-circuit voltages up to 2.3 V. In a recent development, the race to development hydrogen technology has expanded beyond the global realm. Mendes et al., reported [19] about dye-sensitized solar cells in a tandem arrangement for hydrogen production by water splitting; they connected two DSCs in serious operating to cleavage of water, and the effective conversion for solar and hydrogen were 8.5% and 1.12%, respectively. In addition, Kim et al. [20] reported the production of 400 mmol hydrogen for 5 h in a light-assisted electrolysis cell operated with a dye-sensitized solar cell. Nevertheless, the system to increase the voltage of the solar cells was connected in several layers but the hydrogen production efficiency was low. In addition, there was no mention of the most efficient conditions. Therefore, a more efficient and simple design is needed for commercialization. To observe photo-assisted hydrogen production in a photoelectrochemical water splitting system in this study, a photoelectrochemical water electrolysis system that can separate hydrogen and oxygen gases was designed based on the serial module of dye-sensitized solar cells. There are typically several serial modules [21\u201323]. In particular, the W-type [24,25] was a well-known process as the simplest and the position of the electrode structure with a staggered zigzag, as shown in Scheme 1 . A W-typed dye-sensitized serial solar module (W-typed DSSM) was also fabricated in this study. To determine the optimal conditions for high hydrogen evolution, the cell thickness and numbers, and thickness of the Pt counter electrode were fabricated differently and their impedances were estimated.  To determine the optimal conditions of the module, the unit cell width, thickness of the TiO2 film and Pt concentration in the counter electrode were varied. Scheme 2 shows the fabrication process of the module. First, the FTO glass with a unit surface resistance of 10 \u03a9/\u25a1 was cut to the correct size and dry-etched to prepare the insulation. The columns were placed on two sides on the center insulator. Using Ag paste, the two cells were connected and placed on both sides of the electrodes in the W-type, and a TiO2 paste (solvothermally synthesized [26] was cross-coated on the FTO glass substrate and burned for 30 min at 450 \u00b0C. To prepare TiO2 pastes for the working electrode films in DSCs, 2.0 g of TiO2 powder was mixed in a solution consisting of 5.0 g of \u03b1-terpineol, 0.5 g of cellulose, and 20 mL of ethanol. The white colored sol-mixture was sonicated at a power density of 1200 W cm\u22122 for 24 h. After the thermal treatment, the TiO2 film was immersed in the dye solution formed from 0.3 mM Ruthenium 535 bis-TBA (N719-Solaronix SA) for 12 h. The Pt film for the counter electrode was coated by ion sputtering (Ion Sputter; Hitachi, E-1030), and the Pt layer was deposited, carefully avoiding the parts including the TiO2 film and isolated part. The Pt film thickness was controlled by the sputtering time. A 30 \u03bcm thick thermo-hot-melt sealing sheet was placed between the two electrodes, TiO2 electrode and a Pt counter electrode, and heated and pressed to 110 \u00b0C for 10 s. The electrolyte, iodolyte AN-50 (Solaronix SA), was injected into the cell through a pin-hole. The pin-hole was then covered using a glass seal. Finally, a W-typed dye-sensitized serial solar module was completed. The photocurrent\u2013voltage curve was tested by installing the voltmeter, ammeter and a variable load between the two electrodes. The electrostatic voltmeter and lock-in amplifier were used and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "a 150 W Xenon lamp as a light source was adjusted to be similar to the AM-1.5 emission intensity. The light intensity was measured using the power analyzer and thermal smart-sensor. The voltage\u2013current curve were obtained from the open-circuit voltage (V oc), short circuit current (J sc), and fill factor (FF), and the solar energy conversion efficiency (\u03b7) was evaluated using Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively [27]. FF=Jmax.powerpoint\u00d7Vmax.powerpoint/Jsc\u00d7Voc \u03b7(%)=Pout/Pin\u00d7100=Jmax.powerpoint\u00d7Vmax.powerpoint/Pin\u00d7100=Jsc\u00d7Voc\u00d7FF The interfacial resistance at the open circuit voltage was measured by recording the impedance behavior at frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz using an impedance spectroscopy analyzer, and voltage amplification was maintained at 10 mV. In general, to increase the efficiency of the module, the interfacial resistance should be lowest under all conditions. Therefore, these variables in the width and thickness of the TiO2 film and Pt film thickness were tested to determine the best conditions for preparing the module. In the first step, the width of the TiO2 films were changed to 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mm, and the TiO2 thicknesses in the second step were adjusted to 4, 8 and 12 \u03bcm after finding the optimal TiO2 width with the lowest interfacial resistance and setting the width of TiO2. At the same time, the thickness of the Pt film was varied (4, 8, 12, and 16 nm), and their impedances were measured. The impedances of the assembled modules were measured under a range of conditions to determine the optimal conditions with high photovoltaic efficiency. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) to test the cell resistances were obtained under the same conditions at AC frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 100 kHz and an amplitude of 10 mV using a CompactStat electrochemical interface (IVIUM STAT technology). The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set to the V oc level of the DSC. A photoelectrochemical system was designed based on the serial module of dye-sensitized solar cells to separate the hydrogen and oxygen gases from water splitting. As shown in Fig. 1 , the W-typed dye-sensitized serial solar module was connected to two carbon electrodes (anode and cathode) and water splitting was performed by electrolysis. The hourly hydrogen emissions were calculated to the optical-hydrogen conversion efficiency. Before calculating the light-hydrogen conversion efficiency, there is normally an assumption that all the current generated from the W-typed dye-sensitized serial solar module transfers completely to hydrogen generation by water splitting. Therefore, the actual efficiency of hydrogen generation is likely to be lower than the theoretical value. In addition, the calculated efficiency of a photoelectrochemical cell differs according to the system type. First, the light-hydrogen conversion efficiency was calculated using the following equation [28]: \u03bcSTH=100%\u00d7Jsc\u00d7Voc/Pin where J sc, V oc and P in mean the photocurrent density of each photoelectrode, optical voltage, and intensity of the light source (input power, 100 W cm\u22122 in this study), respectively. This equation assumes that 100% of the current generated from the solar electrode is used for hydrogen production. Thus the efficiency maybe is lower than the calculated efficiency because it depends on the actual light-hydrogen conversion according to Eq. (3). Therefore, the most obvious method for calculating the actual the hydrogen generation efficiency is to measure how much light energy is converted to hydrogen. A comparison of the light energy intensity and hydrogen produced is needed. The hydrogen production efficiency can be calculated using the following equation [16]: \u03bcSTH=\u0394G(H2O)\u00d7R(H2)/Pin\u00d7A, where \u0394G (H2O) is the standard free enthalpy (237.141 kJ mol\u22121), R (H2) is the hydrogen generation rate (hydrogen production rate, L h\u22121), P in is the intensity of the light source (input power, 100 mW cm\u22122 in this study), and A is the mean irradiated area (irradiated area, 0.0025 m2 in this study).  X-ray diffraction (XRD, MPD, PANalytical) using nickel-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, H-7600, Hitachi) at 120 kV were used to characterize the solvothermally synthesized TiO2 powders. Fig. 2 (a) shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized TiO2 particles. All peaks were assigned to anatase TiO2 (tetragonal phase JCPDS Card No. 86-1157). The XRD patterns showed the main peaks at 25.32\u00b0, 37.86\u00b0, 48.06\u00b0, 53.97\u00b0, 55.09\u00b0, 62.76\u00b0, 68.70\u00b0, 70.33\u00b0, 74.19\u00b0, 75.14\u00b0, and 82.75\u00b0 2\u03b8, which were assigned to the (1 0 1), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 2 1), (2 0 4), (1 1 6), (2 2 0), (1 0 7), (2 1 5), and (2 2 4) planes, respectively. Fig. 2(b) presents TEM images of the TiO2 particles. Spherical TiO2 particles were observed with a mean particle diameter of 7\u201315 nm. The impedances of the W-typed dye-sensitized serial solar module (W-typed DSSM composed of two cells), which were fabricated by adjusting three parameters, thickness and width of TiO2 film and thickness of Pt electrode, were measured. Fig. 3 (a) shows the impedance according to the change in the width of the TiO2 film (5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mm). The lengths of the TiO2 films were a constant 40 mm. The impedance spectrum of the W-typed DSSM showed three semicircles over the frequency range, 0.1\u2013100 kHz. The first semicircle, R 1, is related to charge transfer at the counter electrode, and was measured in the kHz range. The second semicircle, R 2, is related to electron transport at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface in the range, 1\u2013100 Hz. The third semicircle, R 3, related to the Nernstian diffusion within the electrolyte in the low-frequency peak (in the mHz range) [29,30]. Here, the ohmic serial resistance (R s) is associated with the series resistance of the electrolytes and electric contacts in the W-typed DSSMs. These three semicircles indicated the R s, R 1, R 2, and R 3 of an equivalent circuit, as shown under the table. With the exception of R 3, the values increased with increasing TiO2 film width, particularly the R s values, which means that the ohmic serial resistance on FTO glass was significantly larger, depending on the TiO2 film width. The surface resistance, R s, had a close relationship with FTO glass. In general,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the surface resistance of FTO glass was an approximately 10 \u03a9 per unit area. Therefore, proportional increases are natural because the entire area of FTO increases with increasing the width of TiO2 films. On the other hand, Fig. 3(b) shows the side of the coated TiO2 film. This confirms that the TiO2 film was attached stably to FTO glass. Fig. 4 (a) shows Nyquist plots of the impedance measured when the TiO2 thickness of 4, 8 and 12 \u03bcm in the modules was varied. Here, the widths in all modules were fixed to 5 mm, which have the lowest R s value (Fig. 3). Although the TiO2 thickness was increased, the circles for R s, R 1 and R 3 did not increase. On the other hand, a smaller R 2 was observed when the TiO2 thickness was greater. The thickness of the TiO2 films was not considered in this study when it was more than 12 \u03bcm due to film lift-off from FTO glass after the calcination process. On the other hand, the resistance decreased remarkably with increasing TiO2 film thickness (Fig. 4(b)), but the W-typed DSSM efficiency decreased. In general, the efficiency increases with decreasing resistance in solar cells which are connected in parallel. The efficiency of W-typed DSSM composed of two cells was 5.4% at a 12 \u03bcm TiO2 film thickness with a 5 mm TiO2 film width. Finally, by ion sputtering, the thickness of the Pt electrode was adjusted by the sputtering time, 4, 8, 12, and 16 nm. Fig. 5 (a) presents the impedance measurement in each module. The lowest resistance was observed when the thickness and width of the TiO2 film were fixed to 5 mm and 12 \u03bcm, respectively, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In the Nyquist plot, the area of the semicircle increased with increasing Pt film thickness, particularly for R 1. This means that a smaller Pt film thickness results in a lower resistance in W-typed DSSM. The optimum thickness was 4 nm. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the resistance increased proportionally with increasing Pt film thickness, but the W-typed DSSM efficiency decreased, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Fig. 6 (a) shows the I\u2013V curves and photoelectric efficiencies on the 2, 3, 4, and 5 columned W-typed DSSM assembled under the optimum conditions with the lowest resistance, a 5 mm TiO2 film width, 12 \u03bcm TiO2 film thickness, and 4 nm Pt electrode thickness. The open circuit voltage (V oc) increased with increasing column number, i.e. 1.42 V, 2.11 V, 2.88 V and 3.51 V for a 2, 3, 4, and 5 columned module, respectively. The increase in the number of columns in the serial module occurred in more than approximately 0.7 V increments. On the other hand, the current density was inversely proportional to the open-circuit voltage: 5.36, 4.04, 2.68, and 2.13 mA cm\u22122 for the 2, 3, 4, and 5-columned serial module, respectively. On the other hand, the photovoltaic efficiency was not consistent, and was best in the three-columned W-typed DSSM (photovoltaic efficiency 5.11%), and the efficiencies in the 4 and 5 column module decreased with increasing serial. These 2, 3, 4, and 5 columned W-typed DSSM were connected with a carbon stick electrode in the photoelectrochemical system for water electrolysis. Consequently, the voltages were improved depending on the number of unit cells connected in a serial module. The Fig. 7 shows the hydrogen evolution when a 2, 3, 4, and 5 columned W-typed DSSM was used as the power supply, particularly at voltages more than 1.2 eV. The W-typed DSSM was connected to each carbon electrode (both the anode and cathode electrodes were the same as the carbon materials) for water splitting. Hydrogen evolution increased with increasing number of unit cells connected, resulting in an increase in voltage. For a five serial module, hydrogen evolution reached 2.1 mL h\u22121. The light-hydrogen conversions were calculated based on Eqs. (3) and (4) in the Section 2. When the DSSM efficiency in Fig. 6 was applied to Eq. (3), the light-hydrogen conversions were 7.6%, 8.5%, 7.7%, and 7.4% for the 2, 3, 4, and 5 columned W-typed DSSM, respectively. As commented in the Section 2, the actual efficiency is lower than the calculated efficiency because it depends on the actual light-hydrogen conversion according to Eq. (3). For example, from the photocurrent of a solar cell efficiency of more than 7%, the actual amount of hydrogen measured was 3.5%, showing a 50% loss of efficiency. Therefore, an attempt was made to obtain the light-hydrogen conversions using Eq. (4) and the slopes (hydrogen evolution rate) in Fig. 7. The R values (the slopes, L h\u22121) for the 2, 3, 4, and 5 columned W-typed DSSM were 0.00040, 0.00071, 0.00121, and 0.00213 L h\u22121, respectively. Therefore, the actual light-hydrogen conversions were calculated to be 0.38%, 0.67%, 1.15%, and 2.02%, respectively. This value, however, may contain many errors because it is difficult to determine them precisely with a small amount of hydrogen. The unique point where the efficiencies obtained by Eq. (3) were similar regardless of the number of W-typed DSSM connected in series, but the efficiencies obtained by Eq. (4) increased with increasing number of serial modules. In general, the efficiency should increase with increasing voltage. Therefore, in this study, the light-hydrogen conversion efficiency achieved by the equation of the latter was considered to be more reliable.  This study evaluated the enhancement of hydrogen production from water electrolysis using a W-typed dye-sensitized serial solar module (W-typed DSSM). FTO glass with unit surface resistance of 10 \u03a9/\u25a1 was cut to the correct size and dry-etched for insulation. The columns were placed on two sides of the center insulator. The two cells were connected with Ag paste, and arranged in the shape of a W character. To determine the optimal W-typed DSSM for high hydrogen evolution, the TiO2 film thickness and width, and thickness of the Pt counter electrode film were varied. The photovoltaic efficiency was not consistent, and was best in the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "three-columned W-typed DSSM (photovoltaic efficiency of 5.11%); the efficiencies in the 4 and 5 columned modules decreased. The voltages increased with increasing number of unit cells connected in a serial module, but the photocurrent decreased. When the W-typed DSSM was connected to carbon electrodes (both the anode and cathode electrodes were the same as the carbon materials) in the water electrolysis system, hydrogen evolution increased with increasing number of unit cells connected. Two types of equations for light-hydrogen conversion were suggested, and a equation, \u03bc STH = \u0394G(H2O) \u00d7 R(H2)/P in \u00d7 A was accepted in this study. As a result, the actual light-hydrogen conversions were calculated to be 0.38%, 0.67%, 1.15%, and 2.02% for the 2, 3, 4, and 5 columned W-typed DSSM, respectively.

Perovskite solar cells were originally developed in 2009 utilizing the architecture of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) [1]. Perovskite light absorbing materials with the chemical formula CH3NH3PbX3 (X\u202f=\u202fCl, Br, I) exhibit high absorption coefficients [2], long electron-hole diffusion lengths [3], tunable band gaps [4], low-temperature solution processibility [5]. These advantages have attracted photovoltaic researchers with a goal of enhancing the performance of PSC devices. Moreover, numerous research efforts into the design of novel device architectures [6,7], compositional engineering of perovskite materials [5,8], optimization of interfacial characteristics [9,10], and morphology of each functional layers [11,12] have improved the performance of PSCs. Electrode materials are one of the major components in solar cells which are combined appropriately to design and fabricate the efficient device structure. However, conventional flat cell based on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, an expensive material with high sheet resistance [13], limit the integration of PSCs devices into portable and wearable electronics due to the rigid substrate and unavoidable thickness [14,15]. To address these shortcomings, flexible wire shaped PSC devices have been developed to replace traditional devices with similar functions [16]. With the increasing popularity of wearable electronic devices, numerous efforts have been made towards the integration of traditional solar cells into fiber format. Recent research in fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells showed power conversion efficiency ranging from 1 to 5%. Qiu et al. developed a PSC device for the first time with a flexible fiber structure utilizing stainless steel (SS) fiber and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) sheet as working and counter electrode (CE) respectively and achieved maximum PCE of 3.3% [16]. After that discovery, several research efforts have been made utilizing Ti wire as the working electrode (WE) to enhance device performance and flexibility [17\u201320]. Hu et al. integrated traditional PSC device configuration into fiber format, utilizing Ti wire and gold wire as working and counter electrode respectively and achieved a PCE of 5.4% [18]. Besides the choice of fiber/wire based working electrodes, it is also essential to choose the counter electrode which requires an excellent balance between the transparence for light harvesting and the conductivity [18]. Stainless steel and Ti wire as working electrode have already been successfully utilized in perovskite solar cells. However, they have problems in either device performance or cost. There are many possible ways to construct the fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells utilizing the other potential electrode materials which have not been thoroughly investigated in PSCs. CNTs are lightweight and possess good mechanical performance and excellent electrical and chemical properties, which provide the possibility to replace the metal wire in solar cells [14,21]. CNT sheets have been successfully used in fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells as the counter electrode material [20]. However, the carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns show a better surface with entangled and inter-aligned CNTs than the carbon fiber and films [14,22]. Carbon nanotube yarns have been proved to be effective electrode materials in dye-sensitized solar cells [14,23,24] which have the potentiality to incorporate into e-textiles. The CNT yarns are carbon-based eco-friendly, low-cost materials with low electric resistivity, high tensile strength and lightweight [25]. The use of aligned CNT yarns in DSSCs indicates that it could be potentially used as the replacement for conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO)/metal wire in perovskite solar cells. Herein, we present a novel, flexible and three-dimensionally structured perovskite solar cell containing CNT yarns as both working and counter electrode for the first time. We integrated traditional perovskite solar cells into fiber format device and showed that the versatile device configurations are possible by intertwining the yarns. Both yarn shaped electrodes facilitate the subsequent processes of twisting and intertwining. The self-supported and mechanically stable CNT yarns assure that they could be potentially utilized as electrode materials in PSCs. In addition, all solid-state structure of PSCs allows them to be woven into flexible next-generation electronics textiles.  The diameter of single carbon nanotube yarn used was 25\u202f\u03bcm (Nancomp Technologies Incorporated, USA). The preparation of working electrode started with sintering to remove the polymer coating applied to the CNT yarns upon manufacturing. CNT yarns were sonicated in water and then rinsed with acetone, water, and 2-propanol. After rinsing with 2-propanol, the yarns were dried at room temperature and then functionalized by treating with 70% HNO3 for 12\u202fh with continuous stirring at 50\u202frpm. After functionalizing, the CNT yarns were rewashed with acetone, water, and 2-propanol and dried at room temperature. Six functionalized CNT yarns were twisted together to form the working electrode. The preparing of the electron transporting layer started with coating a nanoporous TiO2 layer on the working electrode. 50\u202fml 2-propanol, 5.92\u202fml titanium isopropoxide, and 1.39\u202fml trimethylamine were mixed in a beaker under vigorous stirring for 5\u202fmin to prepare solution A. Solution B was of 50\u202fml 2-propanol, 3\u202fml hydrochloric acid, and 0.72\u202fml water were stirred for 5\u202fmin. Then, the two as-prepared solutions A and B were mixed and stirred for another 30\u202fmin. The working electrodes were immersed into the new solution for 30\u202fs followed by calcination at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fmin. The twisted yarns were recalcined at 95\u202f\u00b0C for another 5\u202fmin. Preparation of microporous solution started by mixing 15\u202fml of deionized (DI) water, 1\u202fml of glacial acetic acid, three drops of triethylamine and 5.921\u202fml of titanium isopropoxide under vigorous stirring for 5\u202fmin. Another solution was prepared by mixing 15\u202fml DI water and 0.25\u202fml 70% nitric acid. The as-prepared two solutions were then mixed and stirred for another 5\u202fmin before hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 240\u202f\u00b0C for 12\u202fh. 2.6\u202fg of polyethylene glycol was added to the solution followed by evaporation 50% of the solvent under vigorous stirring at 100\u202f\u00b0C. The microporous TiO2 solution was dip-coated on the nanoporous TiO2 coated CNT yarns followed by calcination at 300\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fmin. The coating and calcination process was repeated four times. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized using methylamine and hydroiodic acid according to a reported procedure. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "[26]. First, methylamine (12\u202fml, 33\u202fwt% in absolute ethanol, Aldrich) and hydroiodic acid (5\u202fml, 57\u202fwt% in water, Aldrich) were reacted in a 100\u202fml round-bottom flask at 0\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh under continuous stirring. The precipitates were recovered by evaporating the solvent at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh using a rotary evaporator. The products were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized by adding a certain amount of diethyl ether. Finally, the product was dried at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh in a vacuum oven. The inorganic-organic halide perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 461\u202fmg of PbI2, 159\u202fmg of CH3NH3I, 78\u202fmg of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (molar ratio 1:1:1) in 600\u202fmg dimethylformamide (DMF) solution for one hour at room temperature under continuous stirring [27]. The as-prepared TiO2 coated working electrode was dip coated into the perovskite precursor solution for 30\u202fs and then annealed for 5\u202fmin at 100\u202f\u00b0C in nitrogen followed by cooling down to room temperature. The process was repeated, and finally, annealing was carried out at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin in nitrogen. The hole transporting material (spiro-OMeTAD (2,2,7,-7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9\u2032-spirobifluorene)) solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3\u202fmg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1\u202fml chlorobenzene, and then 17.5\u202f\u03bcl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520\u202fmg Li-TSFI in 1\u202fml acetonitrile, Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%) and 28.8\u202f\u03bcl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) were added to this solution [28]. The as-prepared twisted yarn was dip coated in spiro-OMeTAD solution for 2\u202fmin followed by annealing in nitrogen at 100\u202f\u00b0C. Single CNT yarn was used as the counter electrode (CE) The carbon nanotube yarns were treated according to the procedure mentioned in Section 2.1. Then CEs were platinized using Compact Plasma Sputtering Coater for 60\u202fs at 1.5\u202fkV and 5\u202fmA. Then, the CE was wrapping on the outer surface of the WE with a pitch distance of 1.5\u202fmm to produce the three-dimensional CNT yarn based PSC. The morphology of the electrode materials was investigated using Zeiss Sigma VP scanning electron microscope (SEM). We used a Bioscope Catalyst atomic force microscope (Bruker) for AFM measurements. The ScanAsyst mode was used to image the samples in air. This mode is a PeakForce Tapping based image optimization technique that enables the highest resolution. A triangular silicon nitride cantilevers (Bruker, scanasyst-air, spring constant 0.4\u202fN/m) were used for all measurements. AFM images were recorded in the air at room temperature each step of the functionalization process. The device photocurrent-voltage performance was characterized using VersaSTAT3 (electrochemical system with EIS capability, Princeton Applied Research, USA) running cyclic voltammetry with a potential scan rate of 50\u202fmV\u202fs\u22121. A Honle solar simulator 400 (light intensity 100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122) was used to simulate the sunlight for illuminating the cell with an AM 1.5G spectrum.  The schematic fabrication process and structure of CNT yarn based PSC are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The CNT yarn based perovskite solar cells demonstrate coaxial configuration where the different functional layers were coated layer by layer. The mechanism of CNT yarn based PSC similar to other traditional PSC and fiber-based PSC devices. When sunlight hits the cell, perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) absorbs the light, and then free charge carriers are produced from incident photons. Electrons and hole are separated to generate an electric field and then transferred to the electron transporting layer (TiO2) and hole transporting layer (Spiro-OMeTAD) respectively and then collected by cathode (functionalized CNTY) and anode (platinized CNTY). The morphology of CNT yarn was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). CNT yarns which consisted of a large number of multiwalled carbon nanotubes were treated with acid to remove the polymer applied during manufacture. Therefore, the surface smoothness was improved significantly. The electron transport layer (TiO2) coating was obtained through two steps for faster electron transportation. In the first step, the nanoporous TiO2 layer was formed on the twisted CNT yarn and in the second step, a microporous TiO2 layer was formed. The nanoporous TiO2 layer worked as the foundation layer the microporous layer and exhibited a surface for better attachment of the major microporous coating [14]. The calcination of the TiO2 layer with TiCl4 improves the surface area and confirms that any surface irregularities are covered with a TiO2 layer [24]. Although a spin coating process is typically better for obtaining a uniform light-harvesting layer, it is not ideal for yarn/fiber shaped devices due to difficulties in penetrating the yarn shape. Therefore, the perovskite layer was deposited over the TiO2 coated CNT yarn through a single step dip coating. Subsequently, a hole transporting layer (spiro-OMeTAD) was obtained to facilitate the transportation of holes to the counter electrode. In addition, the ionic additives (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)) and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) are added to improve the innate conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD. A platinized single CNT yarn as the counter electrode was wrapped around the cell. The platinization on CNT yarn increases the conductivity of the yarn without altering the physical strength of the yarn [23]. The flexibility of CNT yarn allows an easy warping process at any pitch rate and also ensures the proper contact between the working and counter electrode. The SEM images of the CNT yarn that used to construct the cell are displayed in Fig. 2a and b. The CNTs present in this yarn are highly interaligned which is essential for fast electron transport and lends them excellent electrical conductivity and vertical alignment [23]. The morphology of each functional layers was also characterized by AFM. As shown in Fig. 3a\u2013d, high-resolution AFM images were recorded on uncoated single CNT yarn and after each step of the functionalization process. The AFM image of uncoated CNT yarn is shown in Fig. 3a which reveals the individual carbon nanotubes. The high degree of interalignment helps to increase the electron transportation ability of CNT yarn electrode [24]. Fig. 3b shows the surface morphology of the yarn once it is fully covered with the TiO2 coating. The deposition of TiO2 is uniformly distributed and well defined on the surface of the CNT yarn. It can also be seen that single (black arrow) and clusters (white arrow) of TiO2 nanoparticles are present in the coating on the CNT fiber.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "The perovskite layer on the CNT-TiO2 fiber produces a homogenous coating (Fig. 3c) with two phases, one porous (black arrow) and the other slightly rough (white arrow). The homogenous coating is beneficial to the deposition of the hole transporting layer and helps to reduce the interfacial resistance, thereby increasing the charge transportability at the interface [29]. The spiro-OMeTAD coating shows a homogeneous porous structure (Fig. 3d). Fig. 4 reveals the FTIR spectral features of the TiO2, perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) and methyl ammonium iodide (MAI or CH3NH3I) in the wavenumber range of 400\u20134000\u202fcm\u22121. The FTIR spectrum of TiO2 shows that the band around 3400\u202fcm\u22121 refers to the characteristics of associated hydroxyl groups. The band observed at 3100\u202fcm\u22121 corresponds to the vibrational stretching mode of the hydroxyl group O H. The hump observed around 1600\u202fcm\u22121 corresponds to the bending modes of water Ti OH bond and the peak around 1250\u202fcm\u22121 is related to Ti O modes. On analysis of the spectrum of perovskite we have: the absorption features around 1500\u202fcm\u22121 in the range of 1400\u20131500\u202fcm\u22121 corresponds to the symmetric NH3 + bending, and the absorption features around 1400\u202fcm\u22121 asymmetric CH3 bending while CH3 NH3 + rocking and C N stretching modes are present in 1250\u202fcm\u22121 and 1100\u202fcm\u22121 respectively. On the other hand, FTIR spectrum of methylammonium iodide (MAI or CH3NH3I) reveals that the band around 3400\u202fcm\u22121 can be attributed to N H stretching and the bands observed around 1200\u202fcm\u22121, and 800\u202fcm\u22121 corresponds to the C N stretching and NH3 stretching respectively. The photovoltaic cell characterization was carried out under AM 1.5 illumination. Fig. 5a and b shows the J-V characteristics curve of cell 1 at different length (2.5, 4.0 and 5.0\u202fcm) and three different cells (cells 1, 2 and 3) at the same length respectively. Current density is highest when the cell length is 5.0\u202fcm. On the other hand, the cell potential is highest when the cell is 2.5\u202fcm. With the increase of cell length (2.5\u202fcm to 5.0\u202fcm), the current density falls from 4.0 to 1.9\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122 and potential rises from 0.41 to 0.8\u202fV. This indicates that current density increases with cell length and potential decreases with cell length. Furthermore, Fig. 5b depicts that three different cells at same length (2.5\u202fcm) showed similar J-V performance which proves the consistent performance of the prepared CNT yarn based PSCs. The high VOC results from the low recombination rate and the low Jsc could be affected by the incomplete coverage of the perovskite layer on the working electrode and its smaller than optimal thickness. Further optimization of the thickness of each perovskite layer will help to enhance the photocurrent density and thus the overall power conversion efficiency. The photovoltaic performance parameters (current density, open current voltage, fill factor and power conversion efficiency) of different cell lengths were investigated, and the results are summarized in Figs. 6 and 7 . The average Jsc value decreases with decreasing the cell length, and it shows a maximum when the cell length is 4\u202fcm to 5\u202fcm with the average Jsc appearing to peak around 4.5\u202fcm (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, the average VOC value increases with decreasing the cell length, with the highest value at 2.5\u202fcm which is also cell length that exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (Fig. 6b). The cell with longer length produces comparatively higher resistivity. The cells were composed of enormous numbers of individual CNTs, which are interaligned and entangled. As a fact, the increment of the length of the cell raises the internal circuit resistance and decreases open circuit voltage. Moreover, difficulties during the connection of the cells to the testing equipment (VersaSTAT3) and the silver paste that is used to connect the cells can partially affect the cell performance [24]. Fig. 7a shows the average fill factor of each cell at its maximum power conversion efficiency. The average fill factor values remain almost constant over the cell length from 5\u202fcm to 2\u202fcm. It has been calculated the maximum FF for CNT yarn based perovskite solar cell limited to 0.3\u20130.4, which is similar to that of Ti wire based PSC devices [19]. Fig. 7b shows the average PCE at different cell length with an average efficiency of 0.4%. As the cells are fabricated with different functional layers, it is difficult to narrow the decreased efficiency down to a single causal factor. Besides the resistivity, the defects introduced by manual cell preparation could be another reason for low efficiency. The power conversion efficiency not only depends on open current voltage and short circuit current but also depends on fill factor. The fill factor is a measure of the quality of the cell. Moreover, fill factor, V OC and JSC depend on the morphology of the TiO2 and perovskite light sensitizer. Fig. 8a represents the creation of a 3D sensing environment by placing a mirror beneath the cell to capture the light signal from both sides when the light hits the mirror. Fig. 8b shows an optical image of a fiber-based PSC which was constructed using flexible CNT yarns as both WE and CE. The entwinement of the yarns increases its simplicity and operational flexibility. Fig. 8c shows the best performance cell among all prepared PSCs and exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.631% with a Voc of 0.825\u202fV, Jsc of 2.165\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, and FF of 0.353. The power conversion efficiency is not high enough, but satisfactory, considering the first demonstration of CNT yarn based PSCs. The working electrode (CNT yarn) has higher conductivity than that of semiconducting oxide and is also more capable of transferring the photogenerated electrons to an external circuit than conventional flat electrodes (TCO) [30]. Also, the fast electron transport and interaligned conductive CNT yarn with high surface area play a crucial role in designing longer and more complex cells.  An innovative yarn-shaped perovskite solar cell has been developed with high photovoltaic performance by deploying carbon nanotube yarn as both the working and counter electrode materials. The cell with an excellent electrocatalytic interface with CNT yarn exhibited high surface exposure/morphological characteristics and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "a maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.631% with a high open current voltage of 0.825\u202fV. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first demonstration of perovskite solar cells which utilize carbon nanotube yarns as both working and counter electrode material. The flexibility and the three-dimensional structure of the cells allow them to absorb incident light from any direction and make them a potential candidate for inclusion into the next generation of wearable and portable electronics. The three dimensional, all solid-state CNT yarn based perovskite solar cells open a new era in photovoltaic research, and their continued investigation is a promising strategy for the continued improvement of next-generation photovoltaic devices.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2023.156948.txt", "paper": ["The isolation of a single layer graphene from graphite by micromechanical exfoliation and its remarkable properties with demonstrative performance sparked enormous interests in two-dimensional (2D) materials, for both in the fundamental mesoscale physics and in the applied sciences [1\u20133]. Graphene (Gr) has a zero bandgap (though a very small bandgap opens with substrate interaction), therefore limiting nanoelectronics and photonic applications [1]. Among the van der Waals layered solids, and more specific the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) is a promising class of atomic thin semiconductors awaiting its usage in industry applications besides in hydrogen evolution reaction and in photo-electrochemical anodes [4\u20136]. The thickness dependent transition to direct electronic bandgap (Eg\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.80\u00a0eV) at the MoS2 monolayer limit (MoS2-1L) [7], gives rise to strong light absorption resulting in efficient photo-generated electron-hole pairs (known as excitons) coveted for exciton-photon physics and many-body quantum science [8\u201310]. Thus, the application of new layered materials in nanotechnology opens new perspectives and enables ground-breaking innovations. Moreover, the creation of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with tunable properties from various combinations of modern 2D materials with clean interfaces is a promising task focused on improving the parameters for nanoscale devices. Furthermore, the semiconductor-metal junction is the most effective for device performance. The large-area and single-crystalline epitaxial growth of 2D transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) is one of the most important requirements to meet the challenging demands implied by the semiconductor industry. Therefore, their integration relying on industry-compatible manufacturing processes is still a major challenge, thereby restricting their applications primarily to research laboratories environments. Recently, the vdWHs are exemplified by experimental demonstration of vertical and lateral heterostructures consisting of graphene (semimetallic), hexagonal boron nitride (dielectric; h-BN), and TMDs (semiconducting) [11\u201315]. Therefore, it can create an extensive library of vdWHs displaying new physics [16,17] and unique functionality [18], not available in the individual constituents and bulk counterparts. For example, Lopez-Sanchez and co-workers have shown that the TMDs heterostructures are used in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices because they exhibit very strong light\u2013matter interactions [19]. Other reports include flexible photovoltaics with enhanced external quantum efficiency (\u223c30\u00a0%), broadband photodetector with higher responsivity based on Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr over a long working wavelength (405 to 2000\u00a0nm) [9,20\u201322], and augmented brightness and reduced contact resistance light emitting diodes constructed from WS2/Gr [23]. The introduction of graphene offered an ideal platform to unveil 2D semiconductor-2D semimetal heterojunction along with other aspects. Thus, interfacing MoS2 with graphene, in contrast to similar TMD-based heterostructures, has been proved versatile due to weaker interlayer coupling contributing to marginally improved physical\u2013chemical (electronic, optical, electrochemical, and electrocatalytical) properties [24]. Although, the photonic and electronics properties of Gr/MoS2 vertical heterostructures have been previously studied [25,26], those reports are focused on nanoelectronic transport mobilities and do not usually discuss the role of graphene in influencing the physicochemical properties. Besides, many theoretical studies have focused on the electronic properties and the formation of the Schottky barrier in the vdW heterostructures [27]. It is conceivable that the physical\u2013chemical properties and applications of the vdWHs depend on the stacking sequence of the constituent layers, the layer number, and the supporting platform. Computationally, Qiu et. al., [28] reported electronic and optical properties for Gr/MoS2(1L) heterostructures using density functional theory (DFT) [29,30] calculations and compared them with corresponding calculations from isolated graphene and MoS2 monolayers. The authors reported that a minigap appears at the graphene Dirac point of the Gr/MoS2, in agreement with other reports [31,32]. Moreover, they also reported that the absorption coefficient, refractive index, and the reflectance are redshifted in the heterostructure. The electronic properties of MoS2(1L)/Au (1 1 1) have been reported by Bruix et al. using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and DFT [33]. The authors found that the MoS2(1L) bandgap of MoS2/Au (1 1 1) is the same to those of the freestanding monolayer MoS2. Yortanli and Mete reported Gr/Au (1 1 1) electronic calculations, where they found a downward shift of the Fermi energy (EF ermi) with respect to graphene\u2019s Dirac point showing a p-type doping character [34]. However, we are not aware of a computational study of MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au heterointerfaces. In the present work, we consider the electronic and optical properties of the MoS2 layers and their heterostructures with graphene and gold heterointerfaces using DFT for calculating band structure, electronic density of states, surface work function, and resulting charge transfers at various interfaces. The frequency-dependent dielectric functions and reflectivity spectra are calculated in a large wavelength window useful for optoelectronics, quantum optics, and single-photon emitters for telecommunication. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function are related to the refractive index and the absorption coefficient, respectively. While the monolayer MoS2 is a direct semiconductor, and graphene is gapless, the MoS2/Gr heterostructure still reveals a direct bandgap somewhat than that of the monolayer MoS2. In the heterostructures, while the contribution of Mo-d orbitals to the conduction band is outstanding, the Mo-p, Mo-d, and C-p orbitals contribute to the valence band. The relocation and rehybridization of the orbital in the monolayer MoS2 to form a heterostructure with graphene brought interesting properties that can be applied in the phototransistors based on MoS2/Gr heterostructures. The computational findings are correlated with experimental optical (photoluminescence spectroscopy), vibrational properties (Raman spectroscopy), and work function from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) elucidating the effect graphene layer has on MoS2(1L) properties.  The experimental methods and measurements carried out are described briefly here, (see ref. [35] for details). We fabricated vertical heterostructures comprising of MoS2(1L) and graphene using an efficient dry transfer method on freshly prepared gold Au (1 1 1) coated SiO2/Si substrates imaged using electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We investigated optical (UV\u2013Visible absorption, photoluminescence-PL, and Raman spectroscopy) and electronic (work function and photoconductivity) properties to explore various surfaces and heterointerfaces to signify the interaction with Au substrate and graphene layer, the latter interspersed as \u2018nanospacer\u2019 to minimize PL quenching due to underneath gold and enhance photoconduction for optoelectronic properties and energy harvesting applications. The isolated monolayers 2H-MoS2 (MoS2-1L) and graphene (Gr) were generated as 4 \u00d7. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "4 P63/mmc supercell lattices, with lattice constants 12.76 \u00c5 and 9.87 \u00c5, respectively. The isolated MoS2(1L) supercell is three-layered totaling 48 atoms, with 32 S atoms occupying the top and bottom layers and 16 Mo atoms residing in the middle layer. The isolated graphene supercell has 32 atoms. Four-layer Au supercells, at the (1 1 1) crystallographic phase, were used. The Gr/MoS2 and MoS2/Gr/MoS2 heterostructures supercells were selected as 4 \u00d7 4 and 5 \u00d7 5 supercells for MoS2 and graphene, respectively, such that the lattice mismatch is small. Similar selection of supercells is used for the remaining structures of this work. Figs. 1 and 2 show the DFT optimized unit cells and the electronic structure for Gr/MoS2, Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr, for Gr/Au, and for MoS2(1L)/Au, MoS2(2L)/Au, and MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au, respectively. Simulations Design and Data Analysis: We performed DFT electronic structure calculations for the optimal geometries of various MoS2-graphene heterostructures and corresponding heterointerfaces with Au(1 1 1) using the periodic code Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [36\u201339]. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used [40,41]. The Kohn\u2013Sham equations were solved using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) under the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [42]. We used the D3 semiempirical correction by Grimme [43], which improves the DFT functionals descriptions for the long-range electron correlations responsible for van der Waals interactions. The kinetic energy cutoff for all calculations is 600\u00a0eV, thus ensuring the integrity of our results. The electronic band structures are plotted including the per atom and corresponding (s, p, d) orbital contributions. The convergence criteria for energy self-consistent field (SCF) and geometry optimizations were set at 10-9 eV and 10-4 eV/\u00c5 per atom, respectively. The Brillouin-zone (BZ) was sampled using the \u0393-centered 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1 BZ grid for all calculations in this work. For the isolated graphene, the denser 9 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 grid was also used. The work function \u03a6 was obtained from the equation: \u03a6=Evaccum-EFermi where Evaccum is obtained from the planar average potential calculations. Bader-type ion charges [44] were obtained using the Bader Charge Analysis code by Henkelman and co-workers [45\u201348], which partitions the charge density grid into Bader-type volumes. This code scales linearly with the number of grid points and can be used by large unit cells. Since the substrate and the interface with other 2D materials in 2D-MoS2 strongly affects the physical properties, it is natural to expect that it also provides vital effects on the optical properties. To study the optical properties computationally, we use the frequency-dependent dielectric function written as: \u03b5\u03c9=\u03b5R\u03c9+i\u03b5I\u03c9 where \u03b5R\u03c9 and \u03b5I\u03c9 are the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function, respectively, and \u03c9 being the photon energy. The imaginary part \u03b5I\u03c9 can be obtained computationally from the summation over the occupied and unoccupied states following the equation [49,50]: \u03b5Ii,j\u03c9=4\u03c02e2Vm2\u03c92\u2211c,v\u222bBZdk\u3008UckpiUvk\u3009\u3008UckpjUvk\u3009\u03b4(\u03c9ckk-\u03c9vkk-\u03c9) where e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively, V is the unit cell volume, p is the momentum operator, c and v are the conduction and vallence bands, respectively, Uck is the the crystal wave function, which corresponds to energy Eck, and j=x,y,z. The real part is calculated from the imaginary part via Kramers-Kronig relation: \u03b5R\u03c9=1+2\u03c0\u222b1\u03c9\u03c91\u03b5I\u03c91d\u03c91\u03c912-\u03c92. For compounds having hexagonal symmetry as opposed to cubic symmetry, the dielectric properties are performed with electric field parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis [51]. Thus, the measured dielectric functions are denoted by \u03b5(R,I)E||c and \u03b5(R,I)E\u22a5c and given by [51]: \u03b5E\u22a5c\u03c9=12\u03b5xx\u03c9+\u03b5yy\u03c9, \u03b5E||c\u03c9=\u03b5zz\u03c9 The corresponding refractive index n(\u03c9), the extinction coefficient k(\u03c9), and the reflectivity R(\u03c9) are given in terms of \u03b5R\u03c9,\u03b5I\u03c9,n\u03c9, and k\u03c9 following: n(\u03c9)=12[\u03b5R\u03c92+\u03b5I\u03c92]12+\u03b5R\u03c912 k\u03c9=12[\u03b5R\u03c92+\u03b5I\u03c92]12-\u03b5R\u03c912 or \u03b1\u03c9=2c\u03c9[\u03b5R\u03c92+\u03b5I\u03c92]12-\u03b5R\u03c912, (8\u2032). R(\u03c9)=\u03b5I\u03c9+\u03b5R\u03c9-1\u03b5I\u03c9+\u03b5R\u03c9+12=(n(\u03c9)-1)2+k(\u03c9)2(n(\u03c9)+1)2+k(\u03c9)2 The optical properties are calculated using the independent particle approximation (IPA) [52]. We also used the random phase approximation (RPA) [53] for graphene to check the accuracy of the IPA method. In general, RPA is superior to IPA. However, even for isolated graphene, RPA optical properties calculations requires huge RAM (>10\u00a0Tb) and thus it is impractical for being used by large supercells. All the calculations were run on the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC) supercomputer facilities, using the Stampede 2 and Lonestar 6 supercomputers.  Here, we discuss the electronic and optical properties of mono and bilayer MoS2 coupled with graphene and gold calculated using DFT for the optimized structures shown in Figs. 1 and 2. This study specifically focuses on the band structure, the density of states, the work function, the charge transfer, the frequency-dependent dielectric function, the refractive index, and the reflectivity. Isolated graphene. The DFT calculated dielectric functions for the isolated graphene and the MoS2 have been reported [54\u201360]. Here, we have also calculated the dielectric function \u03b5, the refractive index n, and the reflectivity R for the above-mentioned optimized geometries using the IPA (Fig. S1, Supplementary Materials). The use of a denser BZ grid reveals several peaks in the energy region 0 - 5\u00a0eV, for the in-plane polarization component of the imaginary part of graphene\u2019s dielectric function \u03b5IE\u22a5c. Marinopoulos et. al., have assigned these peaks to the interband \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions, whereas the peaks between 11.67 - 19.91\u00a0eV corresponds to the \u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2217 transitions [55]. Increased BZ grid minimally affects the peaks, which correspond to the \u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2217 transitions. Similarly, for the IPA calculations, the out of plane polarization \u03b5IE//c component shows peaks at 10.92\u00a0eV and 14.47\u00a0eV, which correspond to the interband \u03c0\u2192\u03c3\u2217 and \u03c3\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions, respectively [59]. Our isolated graphene in plane component of the dielectric constant (i.e., \u03b5RE\u22a5c0) is 5.63 and 7.46 for the IPA calculations under the 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1 and 9 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 BZ grids, respectively. The corresponding out of plane component \u03b5RE//c0 has a lower value of 1.56 for both type of grids. Our dielectric constant values comply with Rani et. al., who reported dielectric constant values of 7.6 and 1.25 for the in plane and out of plane components, respectively. Table 1 shows the energy locations from the \u03b5I(\u03c9) spectrum for the most prominent transitions of graphene and MoS2 for all systems studied in this work. The imaginary part of the dielectric function (\u03b5I) for the isolated graphene has. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "been also calculated using the random phase approximation (RPA) under the 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1 BZ grid. The RPA includes crystalline local effects. These RPA calculations were performed using a coarser grid for the representation of the pseudo-orbitals, which is about half the size used in all other calculations (Fig. S2, Supplementary Materials). This is due to the RPA\u2019s high memory requirements. Fig. S2 shows an excellent agreement between IPA and RPA calculated \u03b5I for the in-plane polarization component (i.e., \u03b5IE\u22a5c). However, there are differences in the out of plane amplitudes \u03b5IE//c between these IPA and RPA calculations. This is in agreement with a past report, which emphasizes the role of local effects in the out of plane calculations [55]. The RPA and IPA calculations using the coarser grid for the representation of the pseudo-orbitals show a continuum spectrum for the in-plane polarization \u03b5IE\u22a5c, in agreement with past reports [54,59]. Isolated MoS2 monolayer. The imaginary part of dielectric function for the isolated MoS2 monolayer (MoS2-1L) shows peaks maxima at 2.89\u00a0eV and 5.48\u00a0eV, for in plane and out of plane components, respectively (Fig. S3a-S3b, Supplementary Materials). The \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) appears redshifted relative to \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9), in agreement with past work [28,61\u201363]. However, there are cases, that these spectra have been reported in a reverse order [57,64]. As it will be explained below, the MoS2(1L) maxima peaks from \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) and \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9) also appear in the Gr-MoS2 heterostructures, thus verifying the correctness of our approach. Figs. 1 and 2 show the optimized unit cells, their band structures, and the densities of states (DOS) for all heterostructures and heterointerfaces examined here. The \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) and \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9) peaks for the isolated MoS2(1L) correspond to the transitions namely, Modxy,x2-y2,Spz\u2192Modxy,x2-y2 and Modxz,zy,z2,Spx,y\u2192Modxz,zy,z2, respectively [58]. Our calculated MoS2 (1L) bandgap is 1.61\u00a0eV, which is close to the experimental value of 1.80\u00a0eV [4]. The high dielectric constant \u03b5R(0) out of plane component indicates that MoS2(1L) is suitable for solar cell applications [65], whereas the out of plane high refractive index of 3.73 at around 2.6\u00a0eV shows that MoS2(1L) can also serve as antireflection coating for flat panel displays. The MoS2(1L) high reflectivity shows that it is a good reflector from IR to UV (i.e., in a wider electromagnetic spectral window). The high value of the MoS2 refractive index in the visible (\u223c2.0 - 2.75\u00a0eV) make it suitable to serve as a heat preservation material. It is also noteworthy that such details on the optical properties are challenging to capture experimentally for all heterointerfaces examined here. Gr/MoS2 and Gr/MoS2/Gr heterostructures. The electronic band structure calculations for the heterostructures Gr/MoS2(1L), Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr, and the heterointerface MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au show the presence of the Dirac point at the Fermi energy (EFermi), located at the K point (Figs. 1-2, left panels). Interestingly for the Gr/Au case, the Dirac point is upshifted by about 0.17\u00a0eV, which is in an excellent agreement with the past report of Khomyakov et. al., [66] and indicative of physisorption of graphene on Au substrate. A small bandgap of the order of a few meV (minigap) is opened at the Dirac point for all graphene heterostructures in this work, as anticipated when monolayer graphene is placed on substrates. The presence of this minigap has also been reported previously for the Gr/MoS2(1L) heterointerface [31,32]. The MoS2(1L) bandgap is in the range of 1.27\u20131.77\u00a0eV (Figs. 1-2), which is close to the value for the isolated MoS2(1L) bandgap of 1.61\u00a0eV found here. While for more than one layer of MoS2(2L)/Au, the bandgap becomes indirect, as in the MoS2 bulk case [67]. We examine the changes in the optical properties for the isolated graphene and the MoS2(1L) due to their presence in the Gr/MoS2(1L) and Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures. Fig. 3 shows the frequency-dependent optical properties \u03b5, n, and R for all heterostructures and heterointerfaces of this work. The imaginary part of the dielectric function \u03b5I for the Gr/MoS2(1L) and Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures show peaks that correspond to transitions from graphene and MoS2. Table 1 shows that the locations of these peaks in both heterostructures are located at about the same energies to those from isolated monolayers, for both the in plane and out of plane light polarizations. Moreover, all graphene allowed transitions from the \u03c0 and \u03c3 bands towards the \u03c0\u2217 and \u03c3\u2217 bands are detected computationally in the \u03b5I spectra, for both Gr/MoS2(1L) and Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures. However, this is not the case for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au heterointerface, as it will be discussed later in this section. The peaks of these transitions appear at about the same positions as the ones from isolated graphene, in a similar fashion as the peaks that correspond to transitions involving MoS2. This implies that the overlap between graphene and MoS2(1L) bands is rather small. The larger values of dielectric constants for the heterostructures relative to the isolated monolayers manifests that they are better dielectrics than those of isolated MoS2 and graphene. However, the in-plane component of the dielectric constant for the Gr/MoS2 is smaller than from Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr, whereas the opposite is observed for the out of plane polarization. The heterostructures refractive index spectra are redshifted relative to the one for the isolated monolayers. This agrees with the past report by Qiu et al., on the DFT calculated optical properties for Gr/MoS2 [28], as well as with our experimental optical absorption and photoluminescence properties (Figs. 4-5 ). Moreover, in the visible region, the Gr/MoS2 has a higher refractive index value relative to the isolated MoS2(1L), whereas the opposite is observed for the Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr configuration. These results agree with those reported by Qiu et al.[28]. Therefore, the Gr/MoS2 is an improved material for heat preservation applications relative to the isolated MoS2 (1L). The reflectivity of the Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr is smaller than for Gr/MoS2(1L) energies up to about 11\u00a0eV for both the in plane and out of plane components. An exception to the above statement is observed for the in-plane reflectivity at energies less than 0.6\u00a0eV, where we found the following order: RGr/MoS2(1L)<RGr/MoS2(1L)/Gr. The Gr/MoS2(1L) heterostructure will reflect light better in a wide optical region, since it\u2019s out of plane. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "reflectivity is larger as compared with those found for the isolated graphene and MoS2. MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces. The \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) component for the MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces shows peaks at about 1.52\u00a0eV, which are absent from the corresponding spectra for the isolated MoS2 monolayer. Johnson and Christy reported the dielectric function for Cu, Ag, and Au through reflection and transition measurements at room temperature [68]. The authors reported that the Au dielectric function imaginary part shows a curve that peaks at about 1.0\u00a0eV. In our case, the \u03b5IE\u22a5c associated with Au intraband transition from the Au valance bands to the Au-Mo conduction bands peak occurs at about 1.57\u00a0eV. For MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and Gr/Au, two peaks appear at 1.2\u00a0eV and 2\u00a0eV, which are associated with the Au intraband transitions, which involve graphene bands. There are significant differences in the real part of the dielectric function \u03b5R(\u03c9) between the MoS2(1L)/Au and the MoS2(2L)/Au, where the MoS2(1L)/Au \u03b5RE//c spectrum is comparable to the one from the isolated MoS2(1L). The dielectric constant for the MoS2(2L)/Au is significantly higher than the MoS2(1L)/Au, which implies that an additional MoS2 layer on top of MoS2(1L)/Au improves the heterostructure\u2019s dielectric properties, as expected. However, both heterointerfaces have similar refractive index n and reflectivity R values, for energies up to about 6\u00a0eV. The out of plane component of the refractive index n for the MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces is significantly larger than the corresponding value for the isolated MoS2(1L) and for the Gr-MoS2 heterostructures examined above, for energies up to about 1.6\u00a0eV, with nMoS2(1L)/Au>nMoS2(2L)/Au, with the MoS2(1L)/Au nE//c being the highest for all configurations of this work. This makes the MoS2(1L-2)/Au and Gr/Au materials useful for thermal (IR) coatings. MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and Gr/Au heterointerfaces. It was experimentally observed that freshly prepared gold coated Si substrate, used for investigating the exfoliated graphene and MoS2, influences their physical properties (Figs. 4-5) [7,35,69,70]. Here, we investigated computationally how Au influenced graphene optical properties for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and the Gr/Au heterointerfaces. Specifically, the \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and Gr/Au shows several peaks in the energy range 0.99 - 2.68\u00a0eV and 0.69 - 2.39\u00a0eV, respectively, which correspond to the \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions. However, the \u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2217 transitions cannot be identified from heterointerfaces \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) spectra. The intense peaks at about 1.2\u00a0eV and 2\u00a0eV in the \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9), which involve transitions within the Au bands mixed with graphene bands for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au case, are corroborated with experimental observations reflected in the changes in the optical emission peaks through redshifts, as well as in the vibrational bands due to stronger electron\u2013phonon coupling (vide infra). The MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au has the highest dielectric constant from all materials examined here, which makes MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au a suitable material candidate for photovoltaic solar cell applications. The out of plane component of the reflectivity for the Gr/Au heterointerface showed its highest value at about 2.25\u00a0eV from all structures of this work. Charge transfer and work function. Table 2 summarizes the charges per Mo, S, C, and Au relative to their isolated atoms charges and the work function for all configurations studied in this work. In all configurations, there is some small electron transfer per atom from graphene to Au and MoS2, which makes graphene is a p-type semiconductor in the heterostructures and heterointerfaces. Similarly, there is a charge transfer from Au to MoS2, which makes MoS2 an n-type semiconductor. However, electron transfers from graphene do not correspond to shifts of the Dirac point relative to the Fermi energy, except for the Gr/Au case, in agreement with past reports [34,66]. Thus, charge transfers between graphene and Au and MoS2 do not necessarily correspond to Dirac point shifts. The work function for the isolated MoS2 is larger than the one for the isolated graphene, which is not surprising since MoS2(1L) is a semiconductor and graphene is a semimetal. Moreover qualitatively, the higher the work function the lower the electrical conductivity. The MoS2(1L-2L) adsorption on Au decreases the MoS2(1L) bandgap and its work function value relative to the isolated MoS2(1L), indicating an improved conductivity for the MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces. The MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au has the highest work function from all heterostructures and heterointerfaces in this work. This indicates that the presence of graphene between MoS2(1L)/Au interface changes the conductivity, such that it becomes useful for photoconductive properties (see Fig. 4) and for devising range of optoelectronic devices. We further expand on correlating the above calculations with experimental findings, and discuss the results related to the work function, the photoconductivity, and the lattice vibrational and optical properties. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images (panels a and b), the optical image (panel c) and the AFM topography (panel d) identifying various surfaces and heterointerfaces and unambiguously visualizes layer numbers through contrast for both graphene and MoS2, as well as MoS2/Gr heterostructures. Here, we measured electronic and optical surface properties to probe buried interfaces for MoS2 on Au and MoS2 on graphene. The AFM topography was measured in combination with KPFM obtaining contact potential difference (CPD) showing regions with dark (MoS2) and bright (graphene or gold) contrast levels. The average CPD was determined through measuring the distribution over nanoregions (Fig. 4f). The work function was calculated using the following eVCPD\u00a0=\u00a0\u03a6tip\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03a6sample, where VCPD in volts, \u03a6tip is tip work function calibrated with HOPG, \u03a6sample is of samples and e the electron charge. These values are summarized and plotted in Fig. 4h along with computational values, which are in reasonable agreement with experiment. The tunable work function of MoS2 (1L and 2L)/Au (1 1 1) was calculated to be 4.80\u00a0eV and 4.772\u00a0eV. The work function of the MoS2/Gr heterostructure decreased depending upon the number of graphene layers ranged between 40 and 70\u00a0meV confirming charge transfer from graphene to MoS2 at 2D-MoS2/graphene heterostructures. Partial change of work function values is attributed to the interface dipole between graphene and MoS2 and the electron density redistribution. Fig. 4g shows conductive AFM (C-AFM) measuring local photo-conductive mapping under laser illumination. The contrast is due to photocurrent modulation of local electric field at the barrier interface, wherein the concentration of charged carriers is varied due to the injection of electrons upon laser. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "illumination. These findings manifested in optimal electronic coupling of dissimilar 2D layers layered materials for light energy harvesting [71]. The lattice vibration properties were also probed using confocal Raman spectroscopy [72,73]. Recall that the space group of a single layer MoS2 is P63/mmc (point group D3 h). Consequently, systems with even numbers of layers belong to the space group P3m1 (with inversion symmetry) and systems with odd numbers of layers to the P63/mmc space group (without inversion symmetry) [74]. The first- and second-order Raman spectra (Fig. 5a) highlight signatures associated with planar MoS2 flakes and mono-/bilayer graphene layers, both on Au, and MoS2 heterostructured interface with the underlying graphene layer. Briefly, the prominent vibrational bands associated with MoS2 include the in-plane E\u2019(E2g1 for bulk) mode at 384.0\u00a0cm\u22121 (383.8) and out-of-plane A1\u2032 (A1g for bulk) mode at 403.4\u00a0cm\u22121 (404.5), with frequency difference \u0394f\u00a0=\u00a019.5\u00a0cm\u22121 for mono- (1L) and 20.8\u00a0cm\u22121 for bilayer (2L) consistent with the most of the literature values [4,35]. The spectra in Fig. 5a (middle panel) are related to graphene and interfaces showing a characteristic G band at 1580\u00a0cm\u22121 associated with the in-plane tangential mode. The disorder-activated D band at about\u00a01340\u00a0cm\u22121 was almost absent. The overtone 2D peak\u00a0\u223c\u00a02670\u00a0cm\u22121 (Fig. 5a, last panel) exhibits frequencies and line shapes matching the characteristic mono or bilayer graphene [3,35]. While the in-plane vibration provides information about in-plane strain, out-of-plane mode provides evidence on the quality of the interfacial contacts. Notably, compared to the MoS2 (1L-2L)/Au, the E\u2019 and A1\u2032 mode was red shifted by 1.0\u00a0cm\u22121 and blue shifted by 1.6\u20132.0\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. In the case of the MoS2/Gr heterostructure, the vdWH contact is also characterized by a shift of 12\u201313\u00a0cm\u22121 in the graphene 2D peak. These result from the interlayer interactions with underlying graphene indicates doping of MoS2 monolayer. However, the position of the G band was almost invariant within the uncertainty of the Raman instrumental resolution (less than1 cm\u22121). The optical properties were studied by UV\u2013Visible absorption (Fig. 5b) and photoluminescence (PL) emission (Fig. 5c) spectroscopy. The absorption spectrum yields a reliable measurement of the bandgap either in configuration space or in light scattering momentum space. An obvious broad peak located at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0230\u00a0nm (and 268\u00a0nm) is related to graphene, which differs from larger flakes of 2D-MoS2 that shows peaks at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0620\u00a0nm and\u00a0\u223c\u00a0668\u00a0nm (1.856\u00a0eV) ascribed to B and A neutral excitonic peaks, respectively, arising from the K point BZ [4,14,35,69,70]. The \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions in the absorbance data are detected at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0250\u00a0nm, which is equivalent to about 4.6\u00a0eV. The strongest luminescence peak at 450\u00a0nm (2.76\u00a0eV) is due to direct transitions from deep valence to conduction band, which shifts with excitation wavelength. The room temperature PL spectra also shows a neutral exciton (A) peak at 1.885\u00a0eV, for MoS2(1L)/Au. This finding is in contrast with the reported observation of quenching of PL signal, which we attributed to conformal contact of MoS2 with Au [10,75,76]. On the other hand, exciton A peak intensity becomes stronger two to four times on graphene layers than those when placed on Au. The red shift in A peak transition energy by 43\u00a0meV is observed for MoS2(1L)/Gr(1L) heterostructures (Fig. 5c). The crystalline flakes comprised in these heterostructures are randomly misoriented and therefore it is likely the interaction between MoS2, and graphene is weak. The observed shifts and the enhanced PL signal arise due to the interaction with graphene \u2018nanospacer\u2019 resulting in direct changes in the MoS2 electronic structure as observed through calculations. Furthermore, the spectral shape of the exciton A is modified such that the emergence of the charged exciton (or trion) peak (A-) is observed peaking at 1.835\u00a0eV for MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures, yielding trion binding energy of 30\u00a0meV, slightly higher than those for MoS2 (ca. 20\u00a0meV) and is suggestive of robust excitons at room temperature. These can be exploited for exciton-photonics technologies, such as quantum sensing and light-energy harvesting. An obvious exciton splitting is attributed to built-in electric field at the MoS2/Gr interface regardless of the number of graphene layers. Our experimental results directly and/or indirectly support the optical and electronic properties inferred from calculated band structure, the work function, and the optical properties. The PL spectra can be used to determine changes in the MoS2 bandgaps. This is in a similar fashion as used by Weber and Alonso for determining bandgaps from PL spectra on Si-Ge alloys [77]. Fig. 5c shows that the addition of a second MoS2 monolayer on top of MoS2/Au decreases the bandgap, in agreement with our calculations. This is due to the change of the monolayer MoS2 (1L) bandgap from direct to indirect in the bilayer MoS2 (2L). However, the change in the absorbance is a better approach for determining bandgap changes relative to using the PL spectra. The absorbance data shows that the absorbance peak for MoS2(1L)/Au is observed at higher wavelengths (smaller eV) than the one from the MoS2/Gr/Au. This means that the MoS2 bandgap is less in units of eV for the MoS2(1L)/Au relative to MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au, in agreement with our calculations. However, the PL spectra showed otherwise albeit marginally.  In summary, we performed DFT calculations in MoS2 and graphene heterointerfaces placed on Au and their heterostructures to unravel the electronic band structure and density of states per atom energy and their work function, as well as their optical properties. We also complemented these calculations with experimental findings, specifically correlated with surface work function and optical photoluminescence bands, highlighting the interaction of the MoS2 with the Au substrate and graphene. The frequency-dependent dielectric function, the refractive index, and the reflectivity were calculated for light polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of respective top nanolayer in heterointerfaces and heterostructures. The calculated electronic and optical properties were in reasonable agreement with the past computational reports and with our experimental results. The insertion of graphene layer in-between gold and MoS2 (or vice versa) has significant effects on their electronic and optical behavior despite the weak interlayer interaction. Consequently, interfacing MoS2 with graphene signifies engineered manipulation of physical properties thereby paving the way for their applications in diverse technologies from semiconductors to. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "light energy harvesting and electrocatalysis.

Introducing mesoporosity to tungsten oxide has expanded the range of applications in the fields of gas sensing [], electrochromic devices [], optical devices [], solar cells [,], and catalysis []. The higher activities are obtained by the formation of nano-sized particles with high surface area and tunable pore sizes. Thus, researchers have introduced many different methods to maximize the surface area while maintaining the mesoporosity. However, the surface areas reported are in the range of 5\u2013145 m2/g [,,,,,,,]. The natural components of crude oil consist of a small amount of potentially harmful sulfur compounds in the forms of thiols, sulfides, disulfides, and thiophenes []. It is important to remove these organosulfur compounds during refining processes as the presence of sulfur can cause harm to catalytic converters of exhaust systems, corrode surfaces, and can produce toxic species upon combustion [,]. The harmful sulfur oxides (SOx) can cause acid rain, smog, and respiratory disorders [,]. The conventional sulfur removal method used in industry is hydrodesulfurization (HDS) which requires the use of hydrogen, high temperatures (300\u2013360 \u00b0C), high pressures (3\u20135 MPa), and expensive catalysts (CoMo/Al2O3, NiMo/Al2O3 etc.) []. Moreover, HDS is more suitable for the removal of sulfur in the forms of thiols and sulfides. HDS is inefficient in removing thiophenes, specially dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) [,]. Thus, as an alternative method, oxidative desulfurization (ODS) has been introduced which consist of two steps. First, the organosulfur compounds are oxidized to sulfones or sulfoxides in the presence of a catalyst and an oxidant (organic peroxyacids, nitric acid, ozone, potassium superoxide pressurized molecular oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide) []. Then the polar sulfone or sulfoxide is extracted from the non-polar crude oil. The common catalysts used for ODS are iron (III) complexes [], Fenton-like catalysts [], emulsion catalysts [], metal oxo anion incorporated layered double hydroxides [], polyoxometalates [,,], zeolites [], and metal oxides supported on silica/titania [,]. However, the aforementioned studies have disadvantages such as difficulties in catalyst separation (homogeneous catalysts), poor catalyst reusability, high reaction temperatures, longer reaction times, low yields, and limited substrate scope. Herein, high surface area, multi-valent, mesoporous WO3 synthesized using a novel metal dissolution approach is used for the oxidation of thiophenes under green reaction conditions. Hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidant, which has a high oxygen content (47%) and produces water as a byproduct.  The catalyst, mesoporous tungsten oxide (WO3) was synthesized via the recently reported novel metal dissolution approach combined with reverse micelle formation []. At lower calcination temperatures (250 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C) the materials were amorphous and upon heating up to 450 \u00b0C, the crystallinity increased and monoclinic WO3 (PDF card No. 01-083-0950) was observed (Fig. 1 a). The aforementioned results were further confirmed by SEM (Fig. 1b\u2013d) analyses. At lower calcination temperatures the surfaces of the micro spheres which are made of tungsten oxide nanoparticles are smooth. Upon heating, well defined nano-sized particles were observed on the surface of the micro spheres. The HR-TEM analyses further confirmed the increase in crystallinity upon heating. Tungsten oxide calcined at 250 \u00b0C showed an amorphous nature in the HR-TEM images (Fig. 1e, f) and diffuse rings in SAED patterns (Fig. 1g). When the material is calcined at 450 \u00b0C, lattice fringes were observed in the HR-TEM images (Fig. 1h, i) and bright spots were seen in the SAED pattern (Fig. 1h) due to increased crystallinity. The BET analyses (Fig. 2 a) showed tungsten oxide calcined at 250 \u00b0C has the highest surface area (209 m2/g) and upon heating, the surface areas decreased (Table S1) due to sintering. The average pore diameters increased from 2.0 to 9.6 nm upon increasing the calcination temperature (Fig. 2b). The presence of multiple oxidation states in the material was observed in the XP spectra of W4f (Fig. 2c, d). The spin doublet at 34.5 and 36.6 eV corresponds to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of W5+. The bands corresponding to W6+ are observed at 35.7 (4f7/2) and 37.8 eV (4f5/2) []. The XP spectra of oxygen showed bands corresponding to lattice oxygen (O2\u2212) which were observed at 530.3 eV and bands at 531.2 and 531.5 eV are due to the oxygen species adsorbed on the surface (O2 2\u2212, O\u2212 of defect sites, and OH\u2212) [,]. The oxidation of thiophenes catalyzed by mesoporous tungsten oxide catalyst in the presence of H2O2 was performed by using dibenzothiophene (DBT) as the substrate (Scheme S1). The complete oxidation of DBT with 99% yield occurred within 15 min at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). The products were analyzed using GCMS, 1H, and 13C NMR (Fig. S1). For comparison, 1H and 13C NMR data of dibenzothiophene were obtained (Fig. S2). As a blank experiment, the reaction was carried out without the catalyst and the oxidant where no products were obtained. When one experiment with only the catalyst (no oxidant) and another experiment with only the oxidant (no catalyst) was carried out, no oxidation was observed. Thus, this confirms the importance of both oxidant and the catalyst for the formation of dibenzothiophene sulfone (DBTO2). The effect of catalyst loading, amount of H2O2 used, and solvent type were studied. The substrate scope and substituent effects were evaluated using GCMS data.  Tungsten oxide calcined at 250 \u00b0C showed the highest yield as and the highest surface area, thus the highest number of active sites. When the amount of catalyst is increased, the maximum yield was observed when 20 mg of tungsten oxide is used (Fig. S3). The increment of the number of active sites causes higher yields upon increasing the catalyst loading. The amount of oxidant added plays an important role in oxidation reactions. Theoretically, the ratio between DBT:H2O2 is 1:2. However, experimentally, a higher amount of H2O2 is needed for the oxidation of DBT as the oxidant is decomposed at ambient conditions. Upon increasing the amount of H2O2 added, the yield of DBTO2 increased (Fig.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "S4). When the molar ratio of DBT:H2O2 is 1:10 the maximum yield (>99%) was obtained. Unlike other studies [], the thermal decomposition of the H2O2 does not affect the rate of oxidation in this study since the reaction is conducted at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). The reaction proceeds only in the presence of the polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile. When toluene or ethanol were used as the solvent no oxidation is observed. The nucleophilicity of the polar solvent plays a major role in the reaction mechanism. Bregante et al. reported the oxidation rate decreases in the order of acetonitrile > p-dioxane \u223c acetone > ethanol \u223c methanol []. Solvents with high nucleophilicity competes for active sites and inhibits the activation of activation of H2O2 by the metal centers. The oxidation reaction follows first order reaction kinetics which is in agreement with previous reports [,]. The activation energy calculated for the reaction using the Arrhenius equation is 75.0 kJ/mol (Fig. S5). Furthermore, the catalyst did not leach into the system as the reaction did not proceed when the catalyst was removed after 5 min (Fig. S6). The catalyst was reusable up to 5 reaction cycles without losing significant activity (Fig. S7). After one reaction cycle, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture and washed with ethanol followed by vacuum drying. The experiment done to mimic crude oil by using a model oil showed excellent yield (>99%) and selectivity (>99%). The substituent effect and substrate scope on the oxidation of organosulfur compounds were evaluated by using different organosulfur compounds (Table 1 ). To investigate the substituent effect, 4-methyldibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMBT) were used. 1-Benzothiophene (1-BT) and its substituted versions were used as another set of substrates. The products were analyzed using GCMS and 1H NMR (Figs. S8\u2013S12). Furthermore, thiol and its derivatives were used as additional substrates. The catalytic activity on the oxidation is decreased in the order of DBT > 4,6-DMBT > 1-BT where the complete oxidation occurred within 15, 30, and 60 min respectively (Fig. S13). The reactivity of the organosulfur compounds plays a major role in the oxidation ability. Thus, electronic density around the sulfur atoms and steric hindrance cause the differences observed in the oxidation rate [,,]. The catalyst was tested with a mixture of multiple organosulfur compounds present in the same model oil. The components used were dibenzothiophene, 4,6-dimethyldimenzothiophene, and 1-benzothiophene where the yields of the oxidized products were >99%, >99%, and 98% respectively. A plausible mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of organosulfur compounds is proposed (Scheme S2) using the experimental results obtained in this study and literature reports [,]. The first step would be the activation of H2O2 by mesoporous tungsten oxide. A nucleophilic attack by H2O2 occurs on the catalyst (a) followed by the reversible removal of a water molecule results in a hydroperoxytungstate species (c). The coordination of the peroxo group to the high valent W6+ produces an electrophilically activated state. Thus, the next step, nucleophilic attack by the sulfur atom of DBT (1) on the peroxo group occurs efficiently. This regenerates the catalyst and produces a sulfoxide species (2) with only one oxygen atom bound to sulfur. Another cycle of the aforementioned reaction series would occur releasing another water molecule, DBTO2 (3) and the catalyst in its original form. The suggested mechanism is supported by the substituent effect and the substrate scope. When the electron density of the sulfur atom is higher, the oxidation rate is high. When H2 18O2 was used as the oxidant, the oxidized product, DBTO2 with both 18O atoms was observed which was confirmed by the mass fragment patterns in GCMS data (Fig. S14). Thus, the proposed mechanism is further supported. The regeneration of the catalyst without significant changes in the structure and electronic properties were confirmed by the post catalytic characterization data (Figs. S15\u2013S18).  In this study, a high surface area (209 m2/g), multi-valent mesoporous tungsten oxide was synthesized to be used as a heterogeneous catalyst by the novel metal dissolution coupled with a reverse micelle formation approach. The synthesized material showed excellent activity towards the oxidation of organosulfur compounds with >99% yield. The fast reaction time (15 min), ambient conditions (20 \u00b0C), use of a clean oxidant (H2O2), and the production of environmentally benign non-toxic by products (water) make this a green process.  The recently reported novel metal dissolution approach [] was used for the synthesis of mesoporous tungsten oxide where 0.02 mol of tungsten metal was dissolved in 16 ml (excess) of 30% H2O2. The excess H2O2 was evaporated by heating until the volume was reduced in half. The resultant was added to a mixture of 14 ml of 1-butanol and 2.5 g conc. HNO3 followed by stirring for 30 min. Then, 2.5 g of Pluronic 123 was added and was stirred overnight. The resultant sol was heated at 120 \u00b0C in an oven to evaporate the solvent and the solid product was washed with ethanol. The resultant was calcined at 150 \u00b0C, 250 \u00b0C, 350 \u00b0C, and 450 \u00b0C for 12 h, 3 h, 2 h, and 1 h respectively. In a typical catalytic reaction, 0.1 mmol dibenzothiophene, 1 mmol of H2O2, and 0.5 ml of acetonitrile were stirred with 20 mg of the catalyst. After the separation by filtration, the products were isolated by evaporating acetonitrile at room temperature. Then the resultant yellow colored crystals (Fig. S19) were analyzed using GCMS (in the presence of tetradecane as the internal standard), 1H, and 13C NMR. To mimic crude oil, a model solution was created by dissolving DBT in n-octane (500 ppm). Then, 5 ml acetonitrile was added to 10 ml of the model oil and the catalytic oxidation was performed. dibenzothiophene sulfone: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN, \u03b4): 7.97 (d, 2 H), 7.83 (d, 2 H), 7.73 (t, 2 H), 7.60 (t, 2 H); 13C NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN, \u03b4): 121.6, 122.4, 130.8, 131.4, 134.3, 137.6  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Recent research has further advanced to the efforts to develop suitable materials that will substitute indium tin oxide (ITO). Among many candidates based on SnO2 and ZnO , Al-doped ZnO (AZO) is regarded as one of the most outstanding functional materials because of its non-toxicity, high thermal stability, durability against hydrogen plasma, and low cost in addition to its low electrical resistivity (\u223c10\u22124 \u03a9 cm) and high transparency (\u223c85%) in the visible wavelengths . AZO films can be prepared by typical thin film deposition techniques including dc and rf sputtering , pulsed laser deposition , reactive magnetron sputtering , and vacuum arc plasma evaporation . While scalability problem may be encountered with these techniques, pulsed dc magnetron sputtering (PDMS) technique has been recently introduced as a suitable method to prepare high-quality films at large scale and high yield by combining advantageous features of dc and rf magnetron sputtering . Advantages of PDMS include high sputtering yield with high plasma density, long-term process stability, coincident sputtering with evaporation from a partially molten target, and high growth rate without degradation of film quality. These unique characteristics of the PDMS are appropriate for the production of AZO films for transparent electrodes with high performance . Although there have been a few reports on the preparation of the AZO films by PDMS, further systematic studies are still required . In this study, effect of the deposition temperature on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of AZO TCO films fabricated by a PDMS has been investigated. At the same time, applicability of the AZO films to thin-film solar cells has been considered by observing the surface-texturing of the films in wet etching and the resulting optical characteristics. Lowest resistivity of 4.16 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm with the transmittance of over 90% was achieved when the film was deposited at 230 \u00b0C. Further, low reflectance of 2.428% and high rms roughness of 54 nm were obtained after etching the film in HCl solution without degradation of electrical resistivity, thereby suggesting that the AZO films prepared by PDMS is suitable for moth-eye structured antireflective transparent electrodes for thin-film solar cells.  AZO films were deposited on glass substrates in a high vacuum chamber which was initially pumped down to 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 Torr with a turbo molecular pump. The working pressure was maintained at 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 Torr with an Ar gas supply at 30 sccm. A cylindrical ZnO target (250 mm in length and 45 mm in diameter) having the composition of 2 wt% Al was used as the source. Such cylindrical target geometry provides a return path for electrons during each pulse-off phase, which allows the enhanced target efficiency as compared to planar target configurations. The distance between the target and the substrate was about 95 mm and the scan speed of the substrate holder was 15.6 mm/s. The AZO films were deposited to the thickness of 850\u2013950 nm applying the deposition temperatures varying from 150 to 280 \u00b0C. The sputtering power and the pulse frequency were fixed at 2 kW and 70 kHz, respectively. In order to examine the applicability of the AZO films to antireflective TCOs having a moth-eye structure for thin-film solar cells, the films were wet-etched in a 0.5 wt% HCl solution for 30 s, which created the randomly textured surface. The surface morphology of the deposited AZO films was characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4200) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, PARKXE-100). The structural properties were examined with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2500H) using a Cu K\u03b1 radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS NOVA) was also employed to analyze the chemical compositions of the films. Transmittance and reflectance of the films were measured using a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, V-570). Electrical properties of the films were measured via Hall measurement system with van der Pauw configuration at room temperature.  The SEM micrographs in Fig. 1 show the morphology of the AZO films deposited at various temperatures (150\u2013280 \u00b0C) by PDMS in 45\u00b0 tilt view. It can be seen that the AZO films have well-aligned columnar structures. As the deposition temperature increases, the films morphology evolves toward densely packed columnar structure with decreasing surface roughness as shown in Fig. 1(a\u2013e). Fig. 2 shows the XRD spectra of the AZO films deposited at different temperatures. All the films exhibit strong peaks attributed to the (0 0 2) and (0 0 4) planes of hexagonal ZnO indicating that they have c-axis preferred orientation due to self-texturing phenomenon . It is noticed in these XRD spectra that with increasing deposition temperatures to 230 \u00b0C, the peak intensities gradually increase and the peak positions are shifted to larger angles. Increasing peak intensities implies that the crystallinity of the films improves with higher deposition temperature. Shifted peak positions to higher diffraction angle indicate that the inter-planar distance between the (0 0 2) planes decrease. This is ascribed to the increasing degree of substitution of Zn2+ ions with Al3+ ions since the ionic radius of Al3+ (0.53 \u00c5) is smaller than that of Zn2+ (0.75 \u00c5) . The XRD spectra in Fig. 2 also show that the AZO films grow without the formation of secondary phases and clusters such as Al2O3 and amorphous ZnO although traces of ZnO (1 0 0) and (1 0 3) peaks were observed. When the deposition temperature increases further to 280 \u00b0C, the intensities of the (0 0 2), (0 0 4), and (1 0 0) peaks decrease. Noting that the substrate temperature for the columnar growth is in the range of 80\u2013290 \u00b0C under rf sputtering and that our PDMS system gives higher plasma density to the film surface, it is presumed that the columnar grains begin to change their grain structure at relatively high deposition temperature resulting in such deteriorative behaviors . The crystalline sizes which can be. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "estimated using the Scherrer's equation are in the range of 15\u201316 nm. In order to investigate the effect of deposition temperature on the chemical states of the ZnO containing dopant Al, the XPS spectra for oxygen shown in Fig. 3 are analyzed. The O1s spectra shown in Fig. 3 can be deconvoluted into two subpeaks at 530.1 \u00b1 0.15 eV (peak I) and 531.25 \u00b1 0.15 eV (peak II) which are assigned to the O2\u2212 ions surrounded by Zn2+ or Al3+ ions in the wurtzite structure (O-I) and the O2\u2212 ions in the oxygen deficient regions within the ZnO matrix (O-II), respectively . The area fractions of these peaks are summarized in Table 1 . In Fig. 3 and Table 1, it can be seen that the intensity of O-I peak increases as the deposition temperature increases to 230 \u00b0C. Increasing contribution from the lattice O2\u2212 ions, i.e. stoichiometric O2\u2212 ions, accompanied by decreasing contribution from the oxygen deficiency, indicates that the increasing deposition temperature to moderate range (230 \u00b0C in this case) resulted in improved crystalline quality as well as the doping efficiency (increasing number of substitutional Al). However, at a higher temperature of 280 \u00b0C, the peak intensity due to the stoichiometric O2\u2212 ions decreases, suggesting that some of oxygen atoms might have been diffused and reacted with impurity atoms such as hydrogen, sodium, silicon from the glass substrate . The XPS results have good correlations to the changes in structural characteristics deduced from the XRD spectra in Fig. 2. The optical transmittance of the AZO films measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer is shown in Fig. 4 . All the films are highly transparent to visible light with the average transmittance higher than 80% while it increases slightly with higher deposition temperature up to 230 \u00b0C. In particular, the transmittance at 550 nm is between 87% and 94%, which satisfies the requirement for the transparent electrodes. The increase in transmittance with higher deposition temperature originates from the improved crystallinity. The optical bandgap energies of the films estimated from the absorption edges in the transmittance spectra increase from 3.57 eV to 3.69 eV with increasing the deposition temperature to 230 \u00b0C. While these values are larger than that of undoped ZnO (3.3 eV) , the blue-shift of the absorption edges is attributed to Burstein-Moss effect , i.e. increasing carrier concentration in the conduction band and resulting shift in Fermi level to higher energy regime. In addition to high transparency, it is necessary that the AZO films should possess sufficiently low electrical resistivity for transparent electrode applications. Fig. 5 shows the electrical properties of the AZO films in terms of the carrier concentration, Hall mobility of the carriers, and resistivity as functions of deposition temperature. The carrier concentrations increase moderately with increasing deposition temperature up to 230 \u00b0C although the sputtering target has the fixed Al concentration of 2 wt%. This is related to the improved doping efficiency that can be deduced from the XRD and XPS spectra and from the Burstein-Moss of the absorption edges. Concerning the Hall mobility of carriers, it increases substantially from 4.4 to 11.3 cm2/V s as the deposition temperature increases to 230 \u00b0C, which could be understood in terms of the enhanced crystallinity. At a higher temperature of 280 \u00b0C, the mobility decreases to 7.6 cm2/V s due to the degradation of the crystallinity in the films that would multiply the number of scattering centers. As a result, the electrical resistivity rapidly decreases from 1.22 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 4.16 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm which satisfies the requirement for transparent electrodes. In thin-film solar cells, efficient light scattering is essential to enhance the absorbance of silicon . Wet etching is a simple but effective and scalable method to produce a surface-textured structure of the AZO films for improved light trapping . The AFM images shown in Fig. 6(a and b) compare the surface morphology of the AZO films deposited at 230 \u00b0C before and after the wet etching treatment. After etching, the film has a crater-like structure with the rms roughness of 54 nm whereas the surface of the film before etching is relatively smooth with the rms roughness of 6 nm (Table 2 ). Formation of the crater-like structure by the wet etching reduced the average specular reflectance of the etched film from 14.194% to 2.428% at 550 nm (Fig. 6(c)). Such reduction of the reflectance is attributed to increased light scattering from the surface craters. Meanwhile, the electrical resistivity of the etched film was measured to be 5.69 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm showing that the etching process did not cause significant degradation of the electrical properties. The results presented above suggest that the wet-etched AZO film prepared at 230 \u00b0C appears to have the desirable characteristics with the enhanced light-scattering capability for transparent electrode applications, especially in thin-film solar cells.  In summary, the AZO films were prepared by PDMS applying various deposition temperatures and were subsequently wet-etched to texture the surface for solar cell applications. Increasing the deposition temperature to a moderate level (230 \u00b0C in this study) accompanied improved crystalline quality and doping efficiency which yielded the lowest electrical resistivity of 4.16 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm with the desirable transmittance of \u223c90% in the wavelength range of 200\u2013800 nm. When wet-etched, crater-like structures formed on the surface of the AZO film deposited at 230 \u00b0C increased the surface roughness significantly, which resulted in the enhanced light-scattering capability as revealed in the reduced reflectance to 2.428%. It is thus suggested that the combination of PDMS and wet etching technique enables large-scale production of surface-textured AZO films possessing the superior properties which would be a low-cost indium-free alternative to ITO for anti-reflective electrodes in thin-film solar cells.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Among other, in case of optical applications, niobium oxide based materials are often used as high index and low loss materials for e.g., optical waveguides , interference filters, antireflective coatings or electroluminescent devices . The most stable form of niobium oxides is niobia (Nb2O5) and it is very attractive for electronic applications. Nb2O5, along with other oxides of metals from the Vth group, have also been investigated as possible candidates for thin film catalysts and corrosion barrier coatings . Recently, there has also been a considerable interest in using the niobia as high permittivity dielectric to replace the existing gate oxides in microelectronic devices . Due to the exceptional thermal stability and mechanical resistance of Nb2O5 compared to traditional high permittivity materials, such thin films are very attractive candidates for the above mentioned applications . This material has also been appointed as a substitute of tantalum pentoxide (\u025b\u2032 = 27) for application in solid state capacitors . Nb2O5 is one of the useful optical materials for its desirable properties, such as stability in air and water, resistance to acid and base, high refractive index (n = 2.4 at 550 nm), low extinction coefficient and high transparency in the UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR region . It has been widely used in e.g., intelligent windows , solar cells and chemical sensors . Niobium oxide is also a promising material for counter electrode in electrochromic devices, which can be used in case of solar cells, solar energy applications, sensors and display devices . Structure of niobium oxide can exist in different polymorphic forms. There are at least three stable niobium oxides: NbO, NbO2 and Nb2O5 and each has various electrical properties ranging from conducting NbO to semiconducting NbO2 and insulating Nb2O5 . The properties of the niobium oxide thin films depend on the type of deposition process and its parameters, such as reactive gas flow or pressure. It was shown by Ramirez et al. that hardness of thin niobium oxide films increased from 3.9 GPa to 5.3 GPa by increasing the pressure and oxide content. On the other hand Chappe et al. determined the hardness values of niobium oxide films of about 6 GPa and Cetinorgu et al. measured the hardness of amorphous Nb2O5 films deposited by dual ion beam sputtering as a function of the ion energy and the values ranged between 5.5 GPa and 6.5 GPa. In this paper surface properties such as topography, roughness, chemical states of the elements as well as the wettability of Nb2O5 thin films were presented. Additionally, optical and tribological properties of niobium pentoxide were determined and the antireflective layer with protective properties for the purpose of the possible use in the silicon solar cells was proposed.  Thin films were deposited from high purity metallic niobium target in the mixed atmosphere of argon and oxygen by microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering process. Microwave source was used to improve plasma ionisation during the sputtering process. Thin films were deposited on microscope glass, silicon and fused silica substrates. The deposition system was operated with the aid of optical monitoring and crystal quartz controllers. Thickness of deposited coatings was equal to 565 nm. The detailed information about the microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering method was given elsewhere . Structural properties were determined based on the results of the XRD method. For measurements multi-purpose Philips X\u2019Pert powder diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 X-rays, PW 3020 vertical goniometer and PW 3710 MPD control unit employing Bragg\u2013Brentano reflecting geometry parafocusing optics were used. Surface of prepared coatings was examined with the aid of atomic force microscope operating in the contact-mode and in ultra high vacuum conditions. To determine the surface topography properties, the AFM measurements were performed by the UHV VT AFM/STM Omicron atomic force microscope operating in the ultra high vacuum conditions in the contact mode. XPS studies were performed to determine the chemical state of the niobium at the surface of thin films with the aid of Specs Phoibos 100 MCD-5 (5 single channel electron multiplier) hemispherical analyzer using Specs XR-50 X-ray source with Mg K\u03b1 (1253.6 eV) beam. Measurements results were then analyzed with the aid of CasaXPS software. All spectra were calibrated with respect to the binding energy of adventitious C1s peak at 284.8 eV. Contact angle and critical surface tension of the thin films were additionally investigated to examine the surface properties of the prepared coatings. Optical properties of the prepared Nb2O5 thin films were determined based on transmittance and reflectance results obtained from Aquila nkd-8000 spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded for 30\u00b0 angle of incident light, for S and P light polarization. Based on recorded transmittance (T \u03bb) and reflectance (R \u03bb) spectra, refractive index, extinction coefficient characteristics and physical thickness of the films were estimated based on reverse engineering method. Fitting of experimental results for Nb2O5 thin films was made using Drude\u2013Lorentz dispersion model with 5 oscillators and Powell's analysis method. Calculations were performed using Pearson's test\u2013\u03c7 2 (Chi-square) and a fit with negligible deviation between the experimental and calculated data was obtained. Also investigations of the reflection of thin films on silicon substrates were performed using FTG FilmStar software. Calculated refractive index and extinction coefficient were used for the purpose of elaborating a model of antireflective coating for solar cell application. The hardness measurements of the obtained coatings were performed by the nanoindenter manufactured by CSM Instrument equipped with a diamond Vickers indenter. The compound hardness was calculated using the method proposed by Oliver and Pharr . Each data point represents an average of five indentations. A number of measurements have been carried out for various depths of nanoindentation (from 80 nm to 700 nm). In order to measure the \u201cfilm-only\u201d properties and minimize the impact of the substrate a method of nanoindentation measurements approximation has been implemented . Measured hardness of the thin films deposited on substrate can be expressed as a power-low function of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the substrate and the thin film hardness, the depth of nanoindentation and the thickness of thin film : H=HSHfHSM where H s\u2013hardness of substrate, H f\u2013hardness of thin film, M\u2013dimensionless spatial function defined by : M=11+AhdB where A, B\u2013adjustable coefficients, h\u2013maximum intender displacement, d\u2013thickness of thin film. Eq. (1) must fulfil essential boundary conditions: when indentation depth approaches to zero (small indentation displacements) measured hardness tends to thin film hardness, whereas when indentation depth approaches to thin film thickness measured hardness tends to value of substrate hardness. Abrasion resistance of the deposited thin films were investigated using the Summers optical's lens coating hardness test kit. On the basis of experiments the scratch resistance was evaluated. For the purpose of abrasion resistance examination, steel wool test was carried out and consisted of rubbing the surface of Nb2O5 coating with 0 grade steel wool pad using applied load of 0.5 N and 1.0 N. Steel wool pad was pressed to the surface of the coating with selected force and was caused to move across the surface of Nb2O5 thin films for 75 cycles. Surface was examined for scratch resistance by optical microscope and profilometer. In case of Olympus BX51 optical microscope working in the reflected light mode, images of the surface of Nb2O5 thin films were captured. Three-dimensional images of the surface of investigated coatings before and after scratch tests were obtained with the aid of TalySurf CCI Lite Taylor Hobson profilometer. The depth of scratches, as well as the change of roughness, was evaluated.  Nb2O5 thin films deposited by microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering were amorphous since no characteristic peaks were observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1a). Amorphous nature of the deposited thin films can result from low temperature of the sputtering process, which did not exceed 100 \u00b0C. AFM images of investigated Nb2O5 thin films are shown in Fig. 1b,c. The images of the thin film show crack-free surface without visible grains. To analyze the surface properties, the height distribution of grains at the surface has been evaluated and presented in Fig. 1d. The height distribution is symmetric what testifies about homogenous surface, while the calculated RMS surface roughness was found to be equal to 0.34 nm. XPS measurements were performed to determine the chemical states of the niobium at the surface of the prepared Nb2O5 thin films. In Fig. 2a and b, the Nb3d and O1s core level spectra are presented, respectively. The position of the Nb3d doublet and the separation energy width equal to 2.8 eV between the peak of Nb3d5/2 and Nb3d3/2 indicates on the Nb5+ oxidation state, which in result testifies about the formation of Nb2O5 oxides . Results obtained for the O1s oxidation state revealed, that the summarized level of the oxygen related to the adsorbed water molecules (H2Oads) and hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2212) is equal to 55% of the overall oxygen bonds occurring at the surface of investigated thin films. The elemental composition of the surface of the deposited thin films was evaluated based on relative sensitivity factors (R.S.F.) for each of the elements core levels and the area of proper spectra. The R.S.F. were obtained from the CasaXPS software library and were equal to 2.85 and 8.46 for the O1s and Nb3d core levels, respectively. Based on these values the elemental composition of the surface was determined as 65.4 at.% and 34.6 at.% for oxygen and niobium, respectively. Wettability measurement results revealed hydrophobic behavior of thin film surface. Contact angle was equal to 92.8\u00b0, 69.0\u00b0, 55.3\u00b0 for deionized water, ethylene glycol and diiodomethane, respectively. Droplet images of different liquids taken during the measurements are shown in Fig. 2c\u2013e. On the basis of the contact angle investigation, critical surface tension of the Nb2O5 thin films deposited on SiO2 substrates was calculated using Zisman approach . Critical surface tension is often presented as the highest value of surface tension of a liquid which will completely wet solid surface. Results have shown that critical surface tension of the Nb2O5 thin films was equal to 24.8 \u00b1 1.7 mN/m. Contact angle measurements in case of deionized water revealed hydrophobic properties of the Nb2O5 thin film surface. The potential uses of hydrophobicity of the prepared coatings include self-cleaning properties and it might favor influence on long-term performance of the silicon solar cells with applied Nb2O5 coating. The optical properties of investigated thin films were measured by Aquila nkd8000 spectrophotometer, analyzed with the use of Pro-Optix software and the results are shown in Fig. 3a,b. Deposited Nb2O5 coatings are transparent in the measured spectral range from 350 nm to 1000 nm and the average transmission level at \u03bb = 600 nm is equal to about 80%. Spectra measured for S and P polarizations are slightly different due to the measurement, which was performed at 30\u00b0 of light incidence angle. Transmittance and reflectance results were used to calculate the values of refractive index and extinction coefficient. In case of solar cell, it is necessary to reduce its reflection coefficient in such a way, that the total light radiation could be absorbed within the volume of the cell's active material. For the crystalline silicon the reflection coefficient has the value of ca., 35\u201345% in the visible spectral range, therefore its reduction is necessary. One of the ways to minimize this coefficient is to apply antireflective coating, which would be deposited on the front surface of the solar cell. However, the antireflective layer need to fulfil some basic conditions, i.e., it is required to achieve the lowest possible value of the extinction coefficient, which would result in a high value of the transmission coefficient . For example, often used coating as an antireflective layer for silicon solar cells is TiO2, which extinction coefficient is usually about 10\u22123 for the wavelength of 600 nm . This allows on reflection losses reduction from the solar cell to about 2\u20133%. In case of investigated Nb2O5 thin films, the value of extinction coefficient for the \u03bb = 600 nm is equal to 3.59 \u00d7 10\u22125,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "while the refractive index is 2.30. Such value of extinction coefficient shows, that deposited thin films almost do not absorb light in the visible light range. Moreover, due to high transmission coefficient and suitable refractive index, the Nb2O5 coatings could be used as antireflective layers for silicon solar cells. To evaluate optical properties of designed Nb2O5 antireflective layer with specified thickness on silicon substrate, the FTG FilmStar software was used. The reflection coefficient of Si substrate was compared to the Si substrate coated with Nb2O5 thin film with the thickness of 65 nm. It was calculated regarding to the value of refractive index of the coating according to the following equation: narc\u00d7d=\u03bbopt4 where n arc\u2013refractive index of antireflective layer, d\u2013thickness of the antireflective layer, \u03bb opt\u2013length of the wave for which the layer is optimized. The results of these investigations are presented in Fig. 3c and showed, that deposited Nb2O5 thin film reduces the light reflection from ca., 39.2% to ca., 0.9% at the \u03bb = 600 nm. What is worth to emphasize, addition of Nb2O5 layer causes, that the reflection coefficient is lower in the whole investigated spectral range from 400 nm to 1000 nm. In case of solar cell, the crucial factor is also the angle at which the light incidence its surface. The investigation results of reflection coefficient in the function of the light incidence angle is presented in Fig. 3d. The reflection coefficient of uncoated silicon substrate is stable up to 75\u00b0 and equal to ca., 39%, while deposition of Nb2O5 thin film reduces the light reflection beneath 10% up to 60\u00b0 of the light incidence angle. Hardness of the prepared niobium pentoxide thin films, which has been measured by nanoindentation and determined by approximation method, was equal to 6.7 GPa (Fig. 4a), 6.9 GPa (Fig. 4b) and 6.8 GPa for silicon dioxide, microscope glass and silicon substrates, respectively. The hardness of each substrate was also investigated and equal to 11.5 GPa, 10.0 GPa and 8.0 GPa for silicon, silica and microscope slides, respectively. As compared to the results presented in the literature reports, hardness of investigated Nb2O5 thin films is higher of ca., 22% \u2013 75% , 13% and ca., 5% \u2013 24% . Tribological properties of prepared Nb2O5 thin films were determined using steel wool test with selected applied load of 0.5 N and 1.0 N. In case of optical microscopy images only single scratches were observed at the thin film surface and they did not influence on optical properties of prepared coatings. It was also observed, that increased load up to 1.0 N resulted in more visible single scratches, than in case of 0.5 N load. The depth of scratches was evaluated with the aid of Taylor Hobson profilometer and the results of these investigations are shown in Fig. 5a\u2013c. As well as in case of optical microscope measurements, during the profilometry investigation only few scratches were found. The cross-section topography of Nb2O5 thin films after scratch tests with different loads is presented in Fig. 5d. The scratches of the thin film after the test with 0.5 N load were shallow and equal to ca., 5 nm. However, increase of the load during the scratch test to 1.0 N changed the depth of scratches up to ca., 10\u201312 nm. The mean arithmetical surface height measured with the aid of optical profilometer changed from 0.72 nm for as-deposited sample to 1.03 nm and 1.24 after performing scratch tests with loads of 0.5 N and 1.0 N, respectively. The depth of scratches was equal only to several nanometers and the roughness did not change significantly. Therefore, the prepared Nb2O5 thin films may be considered as scratch resistant coatings. In case of deposition of Nb2O5 coatings on the silicon solar cells the scratch resistant properties would be beneficial in case of the long-term performance of the cell. Coating of precisely specified thickness would not only be the antireflective layer, but will also prevent from the deterioration of the surface of the solar cell by various environmental hazards.  Niobium oxide thin films deposited by microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering process exhibit several interesting properties. Prepared coatings were amorphous and their surface was homogenous with very low RMS roughness of ca., 0.34 nm. XPS studies revealed that the thin film surface was composed from Nb2O5 oxides, while wettability measurements showed its hydrophobic behavior. Based on optical investigations result it was shown, that prepared coatings are transparent in the spectral range from 350 nm to 1000 nm. Nb2O5 thin films have low extinction coefficient value and proper refractive index in case of application as antireflective layer for the purpose of silicon solar cells. Studies showed that the reflection coefficient of silicon is strongly reduced from ca., 39% to ca., 0.9% at \u03bb = 600 nm after the deposition of Nb2O5 coating with precisely selected thickness. Deposited thin films also exhibit good mechanical properties. Hardness of Nb2O5 thin films was ca., 7 GPa, what is even 75% higher value as compared to the literature data. Investigated coatings are also scratch resistant, what was confirmed by the measurements performed after wool steel scratch tests. Presented results show that the prepared Nb2O5 thin films could be used as antireflective layers for the purpose of application in silicon solar cells. Additional features, such as hydrophobicity and scratch resistance could favourably influence on the long-term performance of silicon solar cells due to self-cleaning and protective properties of the Nb2O5 coatings.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

In spite of TiO2 is the most commonly studied in photoelectrode of PEC system, ZnO has been considered as an ideal replacement to TiO2 owing to its similar energy band structure and higher photogenerated electron transfer rate . What is more, ZnO can be simply synthesized to various morphology, such as nanotube, nanowire and nanotree etc. . Among the variety of nanostructures, one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructure (such as nanotube and nanowire etc.) can provide a direct electrical pathway without crystal boundary resistance . Therefore, it is important to adopt 1D ZnO NT arrays as photoelectrode of PEC system due to its high specific surface area and photoelectrons transport properties . So far, various methods for synthesizing core/shell tubular ZnO-based nanoarrays have been employed, such as electrochemical method , wet chemical method , hydrothermal method and template-based growth . Nevertheless, it is a grand challenge to synthesis large-scale growth of ZnO-based NT arrays with uniform morphology and structure. A novel technique to overcome these disadvantages for large-scale fabrication of well-aligned ZnO-based NT arrays is to apply a simple process based on directional chemical etching. However, bare ZnO photoelectrode can respond only to ultraviolet (UV) region due to its wide band gap, which just accounts for 4% of the sunlight . In order to extend the absorption spectrum to the visible light region, numerous efforts have been done (such as elemental doping and sensitizing with the quantum dots) . Sensitizing with the quantum dots (QDs) has been identified as an effective route for PEC system due to the outstanding photoelectrical properties of QDs sensitizers and its similarities with dye-sensitized photoelectrode . Among the various QDs sensitizers, CdS, PbS etc. demonstrate high photocatalytic activity in PEC system, but their toxicity threats our health and environment seriously. Ternary Zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4), which has a suitable band gap (2.34\u20132.48 eV) according with the visible light region and ideal chemical stability for PEC water splitting, has attracted considerable attention . For ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO PEC electrode, ZnIn2S4 offers favorable energetic for photoelectric since its conduction band edge is more negative than ZnO . To our best knowledge, although ZnIn2S4 has showed high photocatalytic activity, there are few reports about the PEC electrode of ZnIn2S4 served as sensitizer in water splitting. Moreover, it is known that, in a core/shell nanostructure, the introduction of a buffer layer between core and shell can enhance the device performance owing to (a) the buffer layer optimizes the band configuration of the structure; (b) it increases excess carrier lifetime; (c) it improves lattice matching at the heterojunction interface . Lee et al. reported a synthetic route to a CuInS2/CdS/ZnO NR structure for a thin film solar cell with a buffer of CdS . Motivated by the above concerns, herein, we firstly fabricated the ZnIn2S4 sensitized 1D ZnO nanoarrays with a buffer layer of ZnS via a simple chemical conversion method and a convenience directional chemical etching process. Compared with the traditional methods, the chemical route is easy to be controlled and obtained uniform structure, which can decrease defects of the products . In the present study, the effects of reaction time and solution concentration on the core/shell structure and PEC activity of photoelectorde were investigated. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of NT by chemical etching process was discussed in detail according to the experimental results. Finally, ZnO NT arrays with a buffer of ZnS and sensitized by ZnIn2S4 QDs were fabricated to apply in PEC system, the calculated efficiency for hydrogen production of the samples was evaluated to be up to 8.86%. It is founded that the excellent performance is attributed to the enhanced absorption efficiency and appropriate gradient energy gap structure. These results provide new insight in the development of ternary sensitizer QDs sensitized ZnO-based photoelectode for PEC water splitting.  The ZnO NR arrays were directly grown on the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates . In a typical synthesis process, firstly, the ITO substrates were ultrasonically rinsed for 0.5 h in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and ethanol absolution, respectively. The seed layer was deposited on ITO via a sol\u2013gel and dip-coating method. Then the substrates with seed layer were annealed at 400 \u00b0C for 60 min, followed by the incubation in the aqueous solution containing 0.05 M zinc nitrate and 0.05 M hexamethylenetetramine at 90 \u00b0C for 4 h. The prepared samples of ZnO NR films were washed with deionized water and dried in air. The ZnO/ZnS NR arrays were prepared via a chemical conversion process by immersing the ZnO NR arrays in aqueous solutions containing 0.02 M thiacetamide (TAA) at 90 \u00b0C for 7 h. Meanwhile, the ZnO/ZnS NT films of different reaction time were synthesized via a directional chemical etching by immersing the ZnO NR arrays in aqueous solutions containing 0.1 M TAA at 90 \u00b0C for 1 h, 5 h and 7 h, respectively. The as-obtained samples were washed with deionized water and dried in air. In a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, samples of ZnO/ZnS NR and NT arrays were immersed in triethylene glycol (TEG) containing 5 mM InCl3, respectively. The samples of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays were prepared when the auto-clave was sealed and maintained at 200 \u00b0C for 3 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the products were washed with absolute ethanol and dried in air. Meanwhile, samples of ZnO/ZnS NT arrays were immersed in TEG containing 10 mM InCl3, and the auto-clave was sealed and maintained at 200 \u00b0C for 5 h, then the ZnO/ZnIn2S4. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "NT arrays were obtained. The as-prepared products were washed with absolute alcohol and dried in air. Morphology and structure of the samples were characterized using HITACHI S-4800I field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The EDS mapping of the samples analysis were also performed during the FE-SEM observation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were performed using a Rigaku D/max-2500 using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.154059 nm). DU-8B UV/VIS double-beam spectrophotometer was used to achieve the optical absorption spectra of the photoelectrode. PEC properties characterization of the products were determined using an electrochemical workstation (LK2005A, Tianjin, China), a three-electrode configuration, with ZnO-based nanoarrays on ITO as the working photoelectrode, 1 M Na2S solution as electrolyte, saturated Ag/AgCl as reference electrode, and a platinum (Pt) foil as counter electrode. Meanwhile, photocurrents of the samples were measured under the irradiation of a xenon lamp (100 mW cm\u22122) with global AM 1.5 G. The hydrogen generation efficiencies (\u03b7) of the photoelectrodes were calculated by the following equation : \u03b7=I(1.23\u2212Ebias)Jlight\u00d7100% where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm\u22122), 1.23 the theoretical potential required for water splitting, E bias the applied external potential and J light the intensity of the simulated incident solar light, which is 100 mW cm\u22122 in this study. To estimate the correlation between light absorption and photocurrent density on diverse PEC electrodes, incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed under a constant potential of 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl. IPCE values were calculated using the following equation : IPCE=1240Jp\u03bbIlight\u00d7100% where J p is the photocurrent density (mA cm\u22122), I light is the incident light irradiance (100 mW cm\u22122), and \u03bb is the incident light wavelength (nm).  In this work, 1D ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO nanoarrays (including NT and NR) were successfully fabricated through a facile hydrothermal chemical method. The effect of preparation parameters on the structure of the product was studied by adjusting the pH value of solution, the concentration of the TAA solution (or InCl3 solution) and the reaction time. The synthetic route of ZnIn2S4 sensitized 1D ZnO nanoarrays is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . The hexagonal ZnO NR arrays were initially prepared on ITO substrates via a hydrothermal method (Step 1). In this step, the ZnO seed layer was fabricated after sintering and developed into ZnO NRs in the growth solution. It is well known that chemical conversion process based on the ion-by-ion growth mechanism would take place spontaneously when there are sufficient differences in the solubility products constants (K sp) between the reactants and the products. When the ITO substrate coated with ZnO NR arrays is immersed into 0.02 M TAA solution, the sulfidation of ZnO will take place producing TAA hydrolyzes and H2S gas (the chemical reactions happened are as Eq. (3)) , it is because of the large difference between the solubility product constants (K sp) of ZnO (6.8 \u00d7 10\u221217) and ZnS (2.93 \u00d7 10\u221225). CH3CSNH2 + H2O \u2192 CH3CONH2 + H2S The further reaction of ZnO with H2S around the surface of the NRs leads to the formation of ZnO/ZnS core/shell NRs (Step 1-1) (Fig. 2 (a)). Nevertheless, when the sample is immersed into 0.1 M TAA solution, the ZnO NRs will convert to ZnO/ZnS NTs (Step 2-1) (Fig. 2(d)), and the synthetic route of ZnO/ZnS NT arrays was showed in Fig. 2(e), which is attributed to the TAA solution in high concentration can produce more hydrogen ion, and thus the pH was reduced significantly. As an amphoteric oxide, ZnO NRs can react with H+ in TAA solution and the products are soluble salts (Eq. (5)), with the increase of H+ concentration, the chemical etching process on ZnO NRs was gradually enhanced. According to our experimental results, ZnO/ZnS NRs are formed by chemical etching on the outside surface of NRs in 0.02 M TAA solution (Fig. 2(a)), ZnO/ZnS NTs are formed by selective etching on the (0 0 1) polar planes of NRs in 0.1 M TAA solution (Fig. 2(d)). The chemical reactions and the thermodynamic deduction of reactions happened are as following : \u0394G=G(product)\u2212G(reactant) \u0394G=\u0394H\u2212T\u0394S H2S\u21922H++S2\u2212 \u0394G = 119.36 kJ mol\u22121; \u0394H = 53.73 kJ mol\u22121; \u0394S = \u2212220.39 J mol\u22121; T = 298 K; ZnO+S2\u2212+H2O\u2192ZnS+2OH\u2212 \u0394G = \u221246.15 kJ mol\u22121; ZnO+2H+\u2192Zn2++H2O \u0394G = \u221265.89 kJ mol\u22121; It is known that the chemical reactions occur spontaneously when \u0394G < 0, which means that the chemical reaction of Eqs. (7) and (8) will occurred. It can be seen that the \u0394G of Eq. (6) was higher than zero, however, the temperature of chemical reactions occur spontaneously is 298 K. In our experiment, the temperature of solution is 363 K, therefore, the reactions listed above can proceed naturally. It can be concluded that the concentration of TAA solution plays an important role in the formation of ZnO/ZnS nanoarrays during the hydrothermal chemical progress. And the structure (NR or NT) can be controlled by altering the concentration of the TAA solution. The preparation of ternary chalcogenides (ZnIn2S4) is operated in an auto-clave. Finally, ZnIn2S4 shell was obtained after ZnS reacting with enough In3+ in the triethylene glycol (TEG) solvent. When the ITO substrate with ZnO/ZnS NRs (NTs) was immersed in 5 mM InCl3 solution for 3 h, ZnS shell was partially converted to ZnIn2S4. In this step, the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NRs (NTs) could be obtained by using ZnO/ZnS NRs (NTs) as reactive templates, a buffer layer of ZnS and a ternary sensitizer layer of ZnIn2S4 were formed at the same time. In order to investigate the forming process of ZnO/ZnS NTs, ZnO NRs were etched in different concentrations of solution and at different reaction time. Fig. 2(a) shows the TEM image of ZnO NRs in 0.02 M TAA solution for 7 h, Fig. 2(b\u2013d) shows the TEM images of ZnO NRs in 0.1 M TAA solution at different periods. Fig. 2(a) presents a typical TEM image of ZnO/ZnS NR obtained by immersing the ZnO NRs in 0.02 M TAA solution for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "7 h, the result reveals that the ZnO NR is fully covered with a ZnS shell, the diameter of NRs is about 130 nm. As displayed in Fig. 2(b), a slender hollow structure was formed in the center part of the product after being etched in TAA solution for 1 h. When the etching time increased to 5 h (Fig. 2(c)), the hollow structure is bigger, the diameter of hollow structure is about 50 nm. When etching time was reached to 7 h (Fig. 2(d)), ZnO/ZnS NTs with thin-wall were obtained. In brief, the diameter of hollow structure increased gradually with increasing etching time. It can be seen clearly from the above experimental results (Fig. 2(a\u2013d)), the ZnO/ZnS NRs (NTs) with arbitrary thickness can be synthesized by adjusting the etching time in TAA solution (adjusting the concentration of TAA solution). The ZnO/ZnS nanotubes could be obtained in the low pH when the concentration of TAA solution is 0.1 M. On the contrary, the ZnO/ZnS nanorods could be formed under low concentration of TAA solution (0.2 M). On the basis of the TEM images of ZnO NRs in TAA solution at different periods, the formation route of the ZnO/ZnS NT arrays can be proposed as a directional chemical etching mechanism, which is illustrated in Fig. 2(e). In this chemical etching process, the ZnO NRs can be transformed into ZnO/ZnS NTs after treatment in acidic solutions. In aqueous TAA solution, ZnO NRs can react with H+ in acid solution and the products are soluble salts. Therefore, the chemical etching process will occur when the ZnO NRs were immersed in TAA solution. It is generally known that the etching process is directional and mainly focused on the center of NRs, which is attributed to the metastability of the (0 0 1) plane with high surface energy . As a result, the etching rate of (0 0 1) polar plane is faster than that of nonpolar plane, the directional etching of ZnO along the c-axis causes the formation of the NT arrays. With the etching time increasing, the depth of the NT gradually increased. In this work, chemical etching process starts from the top surface of NR, and then the chemical etching process mainly focused on the inner of NR. Eventually, the NTs were covered up because of many ZnS nanoparticles accumulated on the pipe orifice. To further analyze the correlation between the properties of PEC electrode and the NRs (NT) structure, PEC performance of ZnO-based nanoarrays photoelectrodes was performed using an electrochemical workstation. Fig. 3 (A) shows the photocurrent density\u2013voltage curves under the irradiation of AM 1.5 G and dark condition of as-prepared 1 h ZnO/ZnS NTs, 5 h ZnO/ZnS NTs, ZnO/ZnS NRs and 7 h ZnO/ZnS NTs, respectively. It can be seen that the current of samples under dark condition was very low, therefore, the majority of measured current is photocurrent. Furthermore, Table 1 displays the photocurrent density and efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-obtained samples. It can be seen that the photocurrent densities of 1 h ZnO/ZnS NT, 5 h ZnO/ZnS NT, ZnO/ZnS NR and 7 h ZnO/ZnS NT were 0.47 mA cm\u22122 at 0.278 V versus Ag/AgCl, 1.06 mA cm\u22122 at 0.288 V versus Ag/AgCl, 2.10 mA cm\u22122 at 0.312 V versus Ag/AgCl, 2.21 mA cm\u22122 at 0.338 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively, measured in Na2S electrolyte (1 mol/L) under irradiation with simulated light of AM 1.5 G. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 3(C), the theoretical efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-prepared 1 h ZnO/ZnS NT, 5 h ZnO/ZnS NT, ZnO/ZnS NR and 7 h ZnO/ZnS NT were 0.45%, 1.00%, 1.93% and 1.97%, respectively. The maximum efficiency of hydrogen production of 1.97% was calculated, indicating that the shell thickness was a key factor for PEC performance. To understand the interrelation between reaction parameters and nanostructure (such as buffer layer, hollow structure), various samples (ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT) were synthesized by adjusting the concentration of InCl3 and the reaction time. Furthermore, these structures were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 4 (a and b) shows the TEM images and the HRTEM images of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, respectively. It can be seen that the sample is a trilaminar core/shell NR with a diameter of about 130 nm, the surface of NR appears to be relatively smooth, and some nanoparticles are accumulated on the surface. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the HRTEM image clearly presents three distinct sets of lattice fringes, where the crystal lattice fringes spacing are 0.26 nm, 0.25 nm and 0.193 nm, corresponding to the ZnO, ZnS and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Fig. 4(c and d) shows the TEM and HRTEM images of ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively, where the bistratal core/shell nanostructure can be clearly observed. The diameter of NT is about 130 nm, and the ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles are uniformly covered around the NT surface. From the HRTEM image in Fig. 4(d), two distinct sets of lattice fringes are corresponding to the ZnO and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Fig. 4(e and f) shows the TEM and HRTEM images of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively. The sample is a trilaminar NT with a diameter of about 130 nm, and the buffer layer of ZnS can be clearly observed. The HRTEM investigation (Fig. 4(f)) reveals the trilaminar NT is composed of ZnO, ZnS and ZnIn2S4. From the above observations and analyses of TEM and HRTEM, as we expected, bistratal and trilaminar ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO core/shell nanoarrays (NR and NT) were synthesized successfully. In order to further investigate the correlation between the PEC performance of electrode and the nanostructure (such as buffer layer, hollow structure) more explicitly, ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO nanoarrays photoelectrodes were fabricated to determine the PEC properties. Fig. 5 (A) shows the photocurrent density\u2013voltage curves under the irradiation of AM 1.5 G and dark condition of as-obtained ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR and ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively. The current of samples in dark condition was very low, so we can concluded that the majority of measured current is photocurrent. What is. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "more, the photocurrent density and hydrogen generation efficiencies of products were presented in Table 1. The photocurrent densities of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 5.72 mA cm\u22122 at 0.038 V versus Ag/AgCl, 4.20 mA cm\u22122 at 0.156 V versus Ag/AgCl, 7.44 mA cm\u22122 at 0.039 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. Correspondingly, as shown in Fig. 5(B), the theoretical efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-prepared ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 6.82%, 4.51% and 8.86%, respectively. Fig. 5(C) presents the IPCE plots of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, it can be seen that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT photoelectrode exhibited highest photoactivity in visible light. Besides, IPCE profile of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT PEC electrodes is found broadened and strengthened over the entire wavelength region compared with that of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT PEC electrodes. Based on the above analyses, ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT PEC electrode showed the highest hydrogen generation efficiency, revealing that ZnS buffer layer and hollow NT structure were more suitable for absorb photons and separate electrons and holes. It is well known that buffering techniques can inhibit the formation of interface traps and defect states, prolong the excess carrier lifetime. In such an energy gap configuration (Fig. 6 ), a buffer layer of ZnS between ZnO and ZnIn2S4 can enhance the device performance by avoiding undesirable shunt path and widening the depletion width that extend electricfield in absorber layer and minimize the collection loss by tunneling and recombination. As a consequence, the gradient energy gap structure can improved the separation and transmission of photogenerated electrons and holes significantly. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared sample were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Fig. 7 (a) shows a SEM image of the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays, and the inset shows a enlarge view of the NT arrays. It can be seen clearly that the high-density NTs grow vertically aligned on the ITO substrate, and the NT presents a hexagonal shape with diameter ranging from 120 nm to 140 nm. Analysis of SEM images presents that some nanoparticles accumulated on the top of the NTs (inset of Fig. 7(a)), and thus the NTs is covered up. As depicted in Fig. 7(b), the TEM image reveals the product is a trilaminar nanotube, in which ZnO is the hollow core, ZnIn2S4 is the shell and ZnS as buffer layer between the core and shell. The surface of NTs is smooth and a lot of ZnIn2S4 quantum dots (QDs) distribute uniformly over the NT surface. And the diameter of NT is consistent with the SEM observations. The element composition of as-prepared ZnO/ZnS and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 were further characterized using energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping, the EDS mapping of samples are shown in Fig. 8 . EDS results of ZnO/ZnS and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 shows that elements of Zn, O, S and In can be clearly observed. It provides credible evidence for the composition of the samples includes ZnIn2S4. The composition and crystallographic structure of the ZnO NRs, ZnO/ZnS NTs and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs were determined by X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. 9 (a\u2013c). In Fig. 9(a), the ZnO NR presents hexagonal structure according to the standard ZnO diffraction pattern (JCPDS, No. 36-1451). Furthermore, ZnO NR preferentially grew along the [0 0 2] direction, implying that the arrays grew on the ITO substrate vertically. Fig. 9(b) shows the XRD patterns of ZnO/ZnS NT arrays, it can be seen that new peak appeared, which is in agreement with the ZnS (JCPDS, No. 12-0688), indicating that the ZnO NR arrays have been converted to ZnO/ZnS core/shell arrays already. The composition and crystallographic structure of the as-prepared ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs were determined by X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. 9(c), the new peaks can be well indexed to a hexagonal phase of ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS, No. 49-1562). All peaks of ZnO, ZnS and ZnIn2S4 were appeared in Fig. 9(c), which indicates that the only partial conversion of ZnS layer to ZnIn2S4, and further support that the EDS mapping results. Combined with Fig. 9(a and b), these diffraction results suggested that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays can be easily prepared under the current synthetic conditions. The optical properties of ZnO NRs, ZnO/ZnS NTs and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs were characterized by the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 10 (a). It can be seen that ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs exhibit a remarkable red-shift compared to the ZnO NRs, and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs achieve the best efficiency of visible light absorption. Corresponding band gap of the samples are shown in inset of Fig. 10(a), the approximate band gap value of ZnO NRs, ZnO/ZnS NTs and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs are determined to be \u223c3.0 eV, \u223c2.20 eV and \u223c1.76 eV, demonstrating that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs is suitable for the visible light absorption. It should be noted that the ZnIn2S4 sensitizer could improve the photo response spectrum due to the appropriate energy band gap structure (Fig. 6) and the high optical absorption coefficient of ZnIn2S4. Taking into consideration the efficient utilize of visible light in a majority of the solar spectrum, this ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO NT arrays based PEC electrode is an attractive semiconductor materials for water splitting. Fig. 10(b) displays the photocurrent density of ZnO NR, ZnO/ZnS NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively. It can be seen that the photocurrent densities of ZnO NR, ZnO/ZnS NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 0.41 mA cm\u22122 at 0.212 V versus Ag/AgCl, 2.21 mA cm\u22122 at 0.338 V versus Ag/AgCl, 7.44 mA cm\u22122 at 0.04 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively, where the samples are used as photoelectrodes and Na2S (1 mol/L) as electrolyte. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 10(c), the theoretical efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-prepared ZnO NR, ZnO/ZnS NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 0.42%, 1.97% and 8.86%, respectively. The highest theoretical efficiency of sample showed a remarkable increment compared with the ZnO NR and the ZnO/ZnS NT. It can be concluded that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays is an effective nanostructure for water splitting. Furthermore, in order to investigate the stability of as-prepared PEC electrodes, linear sweep voltammograms. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "is measured after C-V scanning for 1 and 15 cycles under illumination, using ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays as typical photoelectrodes. Fig. 10(d) illustrates the photocurrent density of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 1st and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 15th, respectively. The photocurrent densities of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 1st and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 15th were 7.70 mA cm\u22122 at 0.138 V and 7.56 mA cm\u22122 at 0.155 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. It is found obviously that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 arrays PEC electrode shows much more stable current density after C-V scanning under illumination for 15 cycles, revealing a better capability to resist photocorrosion. The efficient utilization of incident sun light, the carrier injection and collection are two key factors contributing to the PEC water splitting. For the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays, a high efficiency of light-harvesting can be achieved by fabricating well-aligned NT arrays with high surface served as the PEC electrode, as well as, carrier injection and collection can be improved by constructing gradient energy gap configuration. The lights transfer process was shown in Fig. 11 , ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles around the NT surface can reflect unabsorbed lights back to the NT arrays and the space between the nanoparticles, and thus the efficiency of light utilization is improved, which is in favor of utilization of incident sun light. Meanwhile, as a high light absorption coefficient in the visible regions materials, a layer of ZnIn2S4 can trap relatively more photons, thereby, more photons would be utilized by NT arrays for generating electron/hole pairs. Furthermore, vertical ZnO arrays on the ITO substrate can directly transport the photo-generated electrons with a high speed, which is beneficial to the carrier transport properties of the NT arrays. The appropriate matching of the gradient energy gap structures of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 is a key factor in the PEC water splitting process because of it can significantly increase the efficiency of carrier injection and collection. The energy gap structures of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 and ZnO/ZnIn2S4 heterostructure are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. As we can see from Fig. 6, both the conduction band minimum and the valance band maximum of ZnO are lower than that of ZnIn2S4. As a result, the ZnO/ZnIn2S4 composite can lead to not only transfer of electron from the conduction band of ZnIn2S4 to that of ZnO, but also transfer of hole from the valence band of ZnO to that of ZnIn2S4, and thus the efficiency of separation and transmission of electron and hole was dramatically enhanced. Based on the band gaps and the relative positions of semiconductor nanomaterials, an appropriate gradient energy gap structure was formed. It can be concluded that an excellent PEC cell was achieved by combining ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NTs with a ZnS buffer layer.  In summary, well aligned ZnIn2S4 sensitized 1D ZnO nanoarrays (NR and NT) have been fabricated on the ITO substrate via a facile and effective chemical method using ZnO nanorod as templates. Two different methods, hydrothermal chemical conversion and directional chemical etching, were used to synthesize ZnO-based core/shell nanorods arrays and ZnO-based core/shell nanotubes arrays, respectively. The formation of the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 nanostructure (NR or NT) was associated with the solution concentration and the reaction time. By adjusting the amount of reactants and reaction time, the core/shell nanostructure can be tuned from NR to NT and formed buffer layer. The calculated efficiency of hydrogen production for ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 PEC electrode were up to 8.86%, the performance of the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 PEC electrode was remarkably enhanced compared with the pure ZnO photoelectrode, which resulted from the broaden absorption spectrum and improved separation ability of the photogenerated electron and hole. This study demonstrates an excellent potential in the design and preparation of ZnO-based photoelectrode for PEC water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2020.145989.txt", "paper": ["Recently, carbon nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention in various scientific and technical fields because of their extraordinary properties including high thermal conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, and optional semiconducting/metallic nature [1\u20134]. In particular, carbon nanomaterials have been used as semiconductors and/or electrodes in various electronic devices (e.g., transistors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and sensors) and have shown to exhibit electrical performances that are comparable to or surpass those of conventional inorganic ones such as Si and oxide semiconductors [5\u201310]. Moreover, their mechanical strength and applicability to various types of processing methods can lead to innovative enhancements in printable, flexible, and wearable electronics [11\u201313]. Therefore, they are regarded as excellent competitive candidates for solution-processable materials for next-generation printed electronics. To assemble carbon nanomaterials for application to various types of electronic devices, patterning is a significant manufacturing step. In general, the patterning methods of carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube (CNTs) and graphene are similar to those of conventional Si-based electronics, wherein the material requires complex lithography and subsequent reactive-ion etching processes with oxygen plasma [14\u201316]. However, these complicated patterning processes are vulnerable to contamination of the surfaces because of the use of toxic chemicals, and the additional etching process is expensive and time-consuming [16,17]. Alternatively, wettability patterning using the significant differences in surface energies has been considered a good way to simply and effectively control the patterns of coated materials via solution routes. This difference between the wetting/dewetting parts provides high resolution patterns of various materials, allowing the fabrication of highly ordered organic semiconductors [18\u201321] and electrodes [6,22]. However, this type of method usually requires complicated pretreatment steps to obtain the differences in wettability, i.e., sequential processes of surface modification and lithography [6,19]. In addition, the materials used to obtain these differences in wettability might be required to be removed [19,23]. To simplify process steps of device fabrication, a clever design of materials that do not need to be removed will help achieve non-lithographic and etch-free wettability patterning. The existence of these materials can also contribute to an improvement in electrical performance of the resulting devices. The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing technique has received enormous attention because of its potential for obtaining high resolution patterns as it provides well-controlled droplets using the electric field between the nozzle and substrates [24\u201329]. Various jetting modes of the EHD printing enable to allow direct patterning of many materials, including silver nanowire, 6, 13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-PEN), poly(3-hexylthiophene), and poly(methyl methacrylate) [27,29\u201331]. Therefore, this technique can directly print the materials used to prepare wettability patterns, achieving high resolution patterns of carbon nanomaterials via a non-lithographic and etch-free process. Here, we report a new approach to fabricate sub-micrometer scale CNTs and CNT/graphene composite patterns using EHD printing and wettability patterning techniques and utilize these patterns as source and drain (S/D) electrodes for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Differences in wettability were successfully obtained by directly drawing 6-\u00b5m wide dimethylchlorosilane-terminated polystyrene (PS-brush) strand-like films so that this printed PS-brush induced the dewetting of the carbon nanomaterial solution. Furthermore, the PS-brush treatment effectively modified the surface hydrophobicity of the substrates, serving as a PS-brush and SiO2 bilayer dielectric to guarantee high stability during the OFET operation [30,32]. This approach achieved both patterning of S/D electrodes and surface modification of dielectrics using only one step without photolithography and etching, which is in contrast to previous methods of patterning conductive polymers, silver nanowires, and CNT by wettability differences [33\u201335]. We also found that solution-processed organic semiconductors were more suitable for our system than organic semiconductors based on the vacuum process, as demonstrated by morphological analyzation. Therefore, we believe our designed patterning method for carbon nanomaterial can assist in the future development of carbon nanomaterials and in the printing industry and in the application of carbon nanomaterials in commercial devices.  Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (diameter: 10\u201320\u00a0nm, length: 5\u201320\u00a0mm) were purchased from Nanolab (Newton MA, US). Water-dispersible graphene paste was purchased from MExplorer. PS-brush (molecular weight\u00a0=\u00a08000, polydispersity index\u00a0=\u00a01.06) was purchased from Polymer Source. Absolute ethanol (99.5%) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Toluene, pentacene, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) solution (PSS, 18\u00a0wt% in H2O), 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene (Tetralin), polystyrene (PS, molecular weight\u00a0=\u00a0125,000), and TIPS-PEN with purity greater than 99% were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All materials were used as received without further purification. Highly doped n-type Si wafers (resistivity\u00a0<\u00a00.005\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm) with a 100-nm thermally grown SiO2 gate dielectric layer were used as the substrates for the OFETs. The Si wafers were cleaned with boiled acetone for 15\u00a0min. Then, the clipped Si wafers were sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 30\u00a0min, dried under a nitrogen stream, and further cleaned with UV-ozone exposure for 15\u00a0min. The wettability patterns were produced by directly drawing PS-brush via the EHD printing technique. In detail, PS-brush ink was prepared using toluene at a concentration of 2\u00a0wt%. This ink was taken in a glass syringe with a nozzle diameter of 200\u00a0\u03bcm and was loaded in the EHD-jet printing machine (Enjet, Korea). The flow rate and working distance in this study were optimized to 0.2\u00a0\u03bcL/min and 180\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. The power supply applied the electric field between the nozzle and the substrate, which served as the ground. EHD printing was performed in micro-dripping mode with DC 1.15\u00a0kV and at various printing speeds between 0.5 and 15\u00a0mm/s under ambient air conditions. After EHD printing, the substrates were annealed at 110 \u00b0C for 60\u00a0min and then rinsed with toluene to remove the un-grafted and un-reacted residual PS-brush. The solution of CNTs was prepared using PSS and ethanol following methods reported elsewhere [28,36]. In a similar manner, the CNT/graphene composite solution was synthesized at a weight ratio 3:7. Then, spin casting was performed to fabricate the carbon electrode pattern. A 50\u00a0nm-thick pentacene active layer was deposited onto the patterned samples by organic molecular beam deposition at a deposition rate of 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0\u00c5/s under a vacuum pressure of 10\u22126\u00a0Torr and substrate temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Another active layer was deposited by TIPS-PEN:PS blend solution prepared at a 1:1\u00a0wt ratio in tetralin with a concentration of 4\u00a0wt% through spin casting. The meniscus formed during the micro-dripping. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "mode printing was monitored using the CCD camera of EHD printing machine. The morphologies of the patterned electrodes were analyzed using an optical microscope (OM, Nikon ECLIPSE LV100ND), atomic force microscope (AFM, VEECO Dimension 3100\u00a0+\u00a0AFM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800). The morphologies of the active layers were analyzed with AFM and 2-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) measurements taken at the 3C beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in the Republic of Korea. The surface potential, energy level of electrodes, and morphological alignment of the organic semiconductor were measured using UV photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the 4D beamline at the PAL. Electrical characteristics of the OFETs were measured using a Keithley 4200 SCS at room temperature under vacuum (~10\u22123 torr) and in a dark state to exclude the effects of H2O, O2, and visible light on the electrical performance of the OFETs.  Fig. 1 a shows a schematic illustration of the overall process of preparing the PS-brush surface modifying layer patterns and carbon nanomaterial electrodes. First, reactive oxygen radicals generated by UV-ozonation generate hydroxyl groups that can react with chlorosilane groups on the substrate surface (Fig. S1) [37]. Then, to fabricate the dewetting patterns, EHD printing was employed to apply hydrophobic modification on the surface with the PS-brush. Then, the surface of the substrate modified by the PS-brush was converted to a hydrophobic surface, as shown in Fig. S1. Next, the solution of carbon nanomaterials (CNTs or CNT/graphene composite) was coated by spin casting, during which significant differences in the wettability between the PS-brush treated surface and the other regions produced patterns of carbon nanomaterial electrodes. EHD printing was used to fabricate the wettability patterns. This printing process is a type of electrospinning method with a short nozzle-to-substrate distance of approximately hundreds of micrometers [38]. The jetting behavior of EHD printing was decided by the deformation of the ink meniscus on the nozzle tip according to the balance with the surface tension or viscous action of the loaded ink and electric field [36,39]. Fig. 1b shows a schematic diagram of the EHD printing process and the OM image at the edge of the nozzle tip of the EHD printer during micro-dripping mode printing. The injected solution formed a bulge at the tip of the nozzle because of gravity and surface tension. Then, if the applied electric field is increased to some extent, the field induces a tangential stress on the liquid surface, which elongates the meniscus on the nozzle tip forming an ellipsoidal shape and deforming to micro-drops, as described in Fig. 1b [26\u201329]. This series of processes can be explained by Rayleigh\u2019s theory based on the balance between the repulsive electrostatic force and the surface tension of the liquid restoring forces as follows [40]. qmax=\u03c0(8\u03b50\u03b3dd3)0.5 where qmax is the maximum charge of the droplet, dd is the diameter of the droplet (m), \u03b50 is the surrounding gas permittivity (C/(V\u2219m)), and \u03b3 is the surface tension of the liquid (N/m). Under our conditions, the micro-dripping mode with 2\u00a0wt% PS-brush in Toluene was operated at a working distance of 180\u00a0\u03bcm, and an electric field of 1.15\u00a0kV applied. The PS-brush chemically reacted with the surface of the SiO2 dielectric, thereby forming a monolayer (sub-nano scale) on the surface [29,41,42]. Hence, our micro-dripping mode, which ejected several micro-sized unbroken droplets uniformly on the substrate, was suitable for fabricating a fine micrometer scale pattern with PS-brush [43]. The pattern width of the PS-brush was investigated depending on the printing speed. Fig. 1c reveals that the width of the pattern decreased as the printing speed increased: the line widths were 228, 163, 130, 112, 57, 19, and 6\u00a0\u03bcm for printing speeds of 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15\u00a0mm/s respectively. This decreasing trend of pattern width may be caused by the decrease in the volume of solution deposited per unit time as the printing speed increased, thus obstructing line spreading [44]. The micro-dripping mode of the PS-brush solution allowed production of sub-10 \u00b5m scaled fine patterns with various shapes at the 6-\u03bcm printing condition (Fig. 1d), and such results are expected to expand the fabrication of wettability patterns with EHD printing in various applications. A grid-shaped wettability pattern was first fabricated using the aforementioned method using EHD printing process (Fig. 2 a). Then, the solution of carbon nanomaterials was deposited on the wettability patterns using spin casting. Fig. 2b and c exhibit the OM image of the pattern of CNTs which were used as the S/D electrodes of the OFETs. As can be observed in the OM image, the square shaped CNTs with a side of 60\u00a0\u03bcm were obviously patterned in a place where the wettability patterns were not applied. These results supported that different wetting characteristics were successfully obtained from the wettability patterns. Additionally, the CNT electrode patterns were fabricated with uniform size over a wide range on the Si wafer. The morphology of the CNT electrode patterns was investigated using SEM measurements, as shown in Fig. 2c. It is obvious from the SEM image that the patterned CNTs were clearly found and existed in highly tangled tubes in the regions not treated with the PS-brush. In addition, the patterns showed a clear edge along the wettability pattern lines (see magnified image in Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the CNT/graphene composite could be used to fabricate carbon-based electrode patterns using the previous described method (Fig. S2). The pattern shapes of the CNT/graphene composite were similar to those of CNTs according to the OM image (Fig. S2a). However, the SEM measurement showed that the CNT/graphene composite formed a pattern with a relatively less distinct edge line (Fig. S2b). These results may arise because the CNT/graphene composite formed folded graphene nano-sheets and interpenetrating CNT nets, which form relatively larger lumps than CNTs and form rugged edges [45,46]. Nevertheless, the CNT/graphene composites were not coated in the sub-micron sized region treated by PS-brush. Also, the difference between the work function (\u03a6) of graphene and CNTs allowed. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the adjustment of the \u03a6 of the electrode by fabricating composite materials. As described in Fig. S3, the surface potential of the carbon-based materials was investigated using UPS analyses. The kinetic energy for the expression of secondary electrons, which is defined as the difference between the vacuum level of the sample and the detectors [47], can be used as an indicator to determine the degree of surface potential. This means that a higher kinetic energy indicates a higher surface potential. In our case, the kinetic energy increased when graphene was added to the CNTs. In addition, \u03a6, which is calculated from the energy difference between the Fermi level and vacuum level based on UPS energy distribution curves (Fig. S3), was 4.71\u00a0eV for CNTs and 4.52\u00a0eV for the CNT/graphene composite. This decreasing trend was related to the composition of the film. It is known that graphene has a work function value of 4.3\u20134.5\u00a0eV, and the work function of CNTs used in our study was 4.71\u00a0eV [48\u201350]. As illustrated in Fig. 3 a, the CNT electrode patterns fabricated through the wettability patterning technique were used as the S/D electrodes for OFETs. The active layers were deposited with organic semiconductor by using a vacuum (pentacene) or a solution process (TIPS-PEN) on the grid-shape S/D electrodes to fabricate bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) OFETs. The devices were operated in the saturation regime with gate voltage (VG) from 5 to \u221220\u00a0V and S/D voltage (VD) of \u221220\u00a0V. As shown in Fig. 3b, both the transfer curves showed device operation properties with negligible hysteresis, which is the difference between OFF-to-ON and ON-to-OFF transfer curves. Generally, the hysteresis formed in OFETs is caused by the traps at the semiconductor/insulator interface or in the insulator bulk [51\u201353]. In anti-clockwise loop direction hysteresis, the transfer curve during the ON-to-OFF sweep shifts toward negative VG values for p-type transistors compared with the OFF-to-ON sweep case and is induced by the long-lived charge traps that are formed at the semiconductor/dielectric interface [53]. Another case known as clockwise loop direction hysteresis involves slow polarization of the insulator bulk originating from several factors such as polar functionalities, ionic impurities, and water molecules [53]. Therefore, our negligible hysteresis transfer characteristics were caused by the PS-brush, which was processed to fabricate the wettability pattern. The chlorosilane group of the PS-brush effectively reacted and bonded with the hydroxyl group on the SiO2 surface. As a result, the reduction in the number of polar moieties on the dielectric surface decreased the charge trap formation and diffusion\u2013absorption of the active species like O2 and H2O on the semiconductor/dielectric interface [54]. These results revealed that our non-lithographical method through PS-brush treatments not only lead to high-resolution CNT electrode pattern but also minimized the charge traps in the dielectric layers, yielding low hysteresis behavior and high performance [55]. Additionally, the transfer electrical properties of devices were extracted from the equation between drain current (ID) and VG: ID=\u03bcFETCiW2L(VG-Vth)2 where \u03bcFET is field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance of dielectric layers (~30 nF cm\u22122), and Vth is threshold voltage. The electrical properties of the OFETs are summarized in Table 1 . The case of TIPS-PEN showed a transistor performance with a \u03bcFET value of 0.172\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and ON/OFF ratio of 105, whereas that of pentacene exhibited a \u03bcFET value of 0.132\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and ON/OFF ratio of 105. In addition, both cases displayed typical p-type transistor characteristics with remarkable linear/saturation switching behavior under stepwise VG elevation, and the output ID values were well matched with the trend of electrical performance and saturated ID in the transfer curve (Fig. 3c). However, there is a difference in the electrical performances between the two types of devices, which is caused by the formation mechanism or arrangement of organic small molecule crystals [56\u201358].  In case of BGBC OFETs, the organic semiconductors are simultaneously deposited on both the channels and S/D electrodes. Thus, the morphological discontinuity of the organic semiconductors deposited on the channels and S/D electrodes could prevent charge carrier injection and increase contact resistance [59,60]. Therefore, the morphologies of pentacene and TIPS-PEN on the channel (PS-brush) and electrode (CNT) regions can affect the electrical performance of OFETs. In this regard, the morphological analysis were investigated using several tools (i.e., CPOM, AFM, and 2D-GIXD). Firstly, the morphology of the surface was analyzed before and after the deposition of pentacene by AFM. Fig. 4 a and d present the AFM images of the PS-brush (channel) and CNT (electrode) area before deposition. Fig. 4a shows a featureless surface morphology of the PS-treated region with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness value of 0.278\u00a0nm. In contrast, individual CNTs can be clearly seen in Fig. 4d and showed an RMS value of 22.1\u00a0nm. These differences in surface morphologies can significantly affect the morphology of vacuum-deposited organic semiconductors. Fig. 4b and e show the morphologies of 50-nm pentacene deposited on the channel and electrode regions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, pentacene on the channels exhibited the typical shape of pentacene crystals and had a grain size of 0.8\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm. As noted in previous studies, pentacene grew via a \u201clayer\u00a0+\u00a0island\u2019\u2019 growth mode, also known as the Stranski\u2013Krastanov mode, on a highly smooth PS-treated dielectric layer [61,62]. The surface affinity between PS and pentacene induced the formation of a percolated layer of 2D crystals under our deposition conditions (25 \u00b0C, 0.1\u00a0\u00c5/s) [61]. After the percolated layer of pentacene covered the surface of the PS-treated dielectric layer, the pentacene crystal islands grew vertically, as shown in Fig. 4b. In contrast, Fig. 4e shows that the morphology of pentacene is very similar to that of the underlying morphology of CNTs rather than the morphology typically observed for pentacene. As mentioned before (Fig. 4d), pristine CNTs displayed lots of empty spaces between each CNT and a high surface roughness. These factors induced the isotropic growth of pentacene with a grain size approximately 300\u00a0nm smaller than that of the channel region and could not lead to typical growth of pentacene crystal grains. To further understand the orientation of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "pentacene in the channel and electrode regions, 2D-GIXD measurement was used, as shown in Fig. 4c and f. Fig. 4c shows the 2D-GIXD images of pentacene in the channel regions. Intense (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks induced by the thin-film phase of pentacene along the out-of-plane direction [32] and other diffraction peaks including (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01), (0\u00a02), and (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02) along the in-plane direction were observed. These results showed the typical crystalline orientation of pentacene, which coincided with that of a thin film polymorphous pentacene phase [32,61,62]. In contrast, the pentacene deposited on electrodes showed a different crystal orientation. As described in Fig. 4f, the (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks were found not only in the out-of-plane direction but also in the in-plane direction. Especially, the (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks formed a complete ring pattern shape, and (0\u00a00\u00a02) peaks showed arcs of diffracted intensity. In addition, the nearly semicircular shape of the (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01), (0\u00a02), and (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02) peaks, which showed intense and sharp peaks in the PS-brush case, was observed. This extraordinary result indicates a drastic change in orientation of pentacene along the c-axis, which aligned with no preference for a specific crystallographic orientation or distributed crystallographic orientation [63]. From the 2D-GIXD image, however, the crystal orientation cannot be determined accurately because the diffraction peaks overlap. Next, we performed NEXAFS spectroscopy in partial electron yield (PEY) mode to obtain the molecular orientation of pentacene semiconductor at the interface between electrodes and the channel region and the deposited pentacene. NEXAFS analysis is used to find the average conformation of molecules in a \u03c0-orbital, single bond, and double bond by detecting the X-ray absorption [64]. NEXAFS spectroscopy was performed for 1.5\u00a0nm and 15\u00a0nm thicknesses of pentacene. As shown in Fig. 5 a\u2013b, and d\u2013e, various polarization angles (\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a030, 45, 55, and 70\u00b0) of the incident X-ray beam were used on the 1.5 and 15\u00a0nm samples, and the tilt angle of the conjugated plane was calculated by plotting the intensity of the corresponding resonance. The peaks at \u03c0* (C C) orbitals were displayed at 279.5 and 281.45\u00a0eV, whereas the peaks at \u03c3* (C C) orbitals were expressed above 285\u00a0eV. The azimuthal average tilting angle (\u03b1) between the C C bond in the conjugated planes was determined by the following equation [65]: Iv\u221dP31+123cos2\u03b8-13cos2\u03b1-1+(1-P)2sin2\u03b1 where P\u00a0=\u00a01 is used for the degree of polarization [66,67]. As described in Fig. 5c and f, we plotted the \u03c0* resonance as a function of cos\u03b8 and found the dichroic ratio (R) and \u03b1 of the pentacene on CNTs (electrodes) and PS-brush (channels). The \u03b1 values for the 1.5\u00a0nm pentacene layer on the CNT was not obtained because the highly rough surface of CNT induced randomly oriented growth of pentacene crystals or hindered the growth of pentacene crystals. In contrast, the \u03b1 values were found to be 57.6\u00b0 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.11), 60.34\u00b0 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.21), and 65.6\u00b0 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.42) for 15\u00a0nm pentacene depositions on CNTs and 1.5- and 15-nm pentacene deposition on PS-brush, respectively. These results indicated the edge-on orientation of pentacene crystals against the substrate except for the 1.5-nm pentacene on CNTs. However, the difference between tilting angle according to the substrates (57.6\u00b0 and 65.6\u00b0) could induce discontinuity between pentacene deposited on CNTs and PS-brush, which makes charge transport difficult. Likewise, morphological analysis of semiconductor was performed with TIPS-PEN. Fig. 6 shows the crystalline consequence of TIPS-PEN deposited on the CNTs and PS-brush with CPOM, AFM, and 2D-GIXD. CPOM measurements revealed the birefringence of TIPS-PEN crystals [68]; the structures of TIPS-PEN deposited on CNTs and PS-brush had dendritic or comet-shaped crystals elongated by several hundred micrometers (Fig. 6a and d). The colors of crystals varied because of the variations in the TIPS-PEN crystal orientation and thickness [18,69]. In addition, the AFM data illustrated the similar comet shape of the TIPS-PEN crystals deposited on the CNTs and PS-brush (Fig. 6b and e). Additionally, the height profiles of crystals in Fig. S5 showed that the step-height of the layer in the crystals coincides with the multiple value of c-axis distance in a TIPS-PEN single molecular layer (~1.7\u00a0nm) [69,70]. This indicated that the crystals were vertically formed, layer-by-layer crystalline structures. Additionally, the 2D-GIXD images of TIPS-PEN deposited on CNTs and PS-brush showed that both crystalline structures were oriented along the (0\u00a00\u00a01) crystallographic direction with conventional edge-on orientation patterns (Fig. 6c and d) [31,69,71]. From these images, the d-spacing of (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks, calculated using d\u00a0=\u00a02\u03c0/qz, was d 010\u00a0=\u00a016.43 and 16.44\u00a0\u00c5 for the CNTs and PS-brush, respectively. These values were comparable to previously reported data about well aligned layer-by-layer structured TIPS-PEN crystals [58,70] and coincided with previous AFM analyzations. Thus, the TIPS\u2013PEN molecules deposited on the CNT and PS-brush had similar orientation of crystals. As shown in Fig. S6, the TIPS\u2013PEN molecules deposited on previously mentioned grid-shape CNTs were continuously connected regardless of the area (channel and electrode region). Therefore, the solution-processed TIPS-PEN is better suited than vacuum-processed pentacene to be used as an active layer for our OFETs fabricated with non-lithographic carbon electrode patterning with respect to crystalline alignment continuity and printable devices.  We introduced wettability patterns by direct coating of EHD printing with carbon nanomaterials (CNTs or CNT/graphene composites) for use as S/D electrodes in OFETs. The wettability patterns were fabricated with a PS-brush, and up to 6-\u00b5m wide lines and various shapes were formed via the simple micro-dripping mode of EHD printing. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of the PS-brush, the solution with carbon nanomaterials was selectively wetted on the non-treated region of the dielectric surface. Thus, we obtained high-resolution carbon nanomaterial electrode pattern without using a lithographic process. Additionally, the PS-brush functionalization of the dielectric surface during pretreatment could minimize the formation of charge traps and diffusion\u2013absorption of the active species on the semiconductor/dielectric interface, resulting in hysteresis-free OFET operation. In addition, we identified the morphological continuity of two types of organic semiconductor. Using the various analyzing tools such as CPOM, AFM, 2D-GIXD, NEXAFS, pentacene can be detrimental to charge transport performance due to large discontinuities between S/D and channel, and in the case of TIPS-PEN, a continuous morphology can be formed, which can be a. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "good phenomenon for charge transport.

Graphene (Gr) has a zero bandgap (though a very small bandgap opens with substrate interaction), therefore limiting nanoelectronics and photonic applications [1]. Among the van der Waals layered solids, and more specific the 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) is a promising class of atomic thin semiconductors awaiting its usage in industry applications besides in hydrogen evolution reaction and in photo-electrochemical anodes [4\u20136]. The thickness dependent transition to direct electronic bandgap (Eg\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.80\u00a0eV) at the MoS2 monolayer limit (MoS2-1L) [7], gives rise to strong light absorption resulting in efficient photo-generated electron-hole pairs (known as excitons) coveted for exciton-photon physics and many-body quantum science [8\u201310]. Thus, the application of new layered materials in nanotechnology opens new perspectives and enables ground-breaking innovations. Moreover, the creation of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with tunable properties from various combinations of modern 2D materials with clean interfaces is a promising task focused on improving the parameters for nanoscale devices. Furthermore, the semiconductor-metal junction is the most effective for device performance. The large-area and single-crystalline epitaxial growth of 2D transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) is one of the most important requirements to meet the challenging demands implied by the semiconductor industry. Therefore, their integration relying on industry-compatible manufacturing processes is still a major challenge, thereby restricting their applications primarily to research laboratories environments. Recently, the vdWHs are exemplified by experimental demonstration of vertical and lateral heterostructures consisting of graphene (semimetallic), hexagonal boron nitride (dielectric; h-BN), and TMDs (semiconducting) [11\u201315]. Therefore, it can create an extensive library of vdWHs displaying new physics [16,17] and unique functionality [18], not available in the individual constituents and bulk counterparts. For example, Lopez-Sanchez and co-workers have shown that the TMDs heterostructures are used in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices because they exhibit very strong light\u2013matter interactions [19]. Other reports include flexible photovoltaics with enhanced external quantum efficiency (\u223c30\u00a0%), broadband photodetector with higher responsivity based on Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr over a long working wavelength (405 to 2000\u00a0nm) [9,20\u201322], and augmented brightness and reduced contact resistance light emitting diodes constructed from WS2/Gr [23]. The introduction of graphene offered an ideal platform to unveil 2D semiconductor-2D semimetal heterojunction along with other aspects. Thus, interfacing MoS2 with graphene, in contrast to similar TMD-based heterostructures, has been proved versatile due to weaker interlayer coupling contributing to marginally improved physical\u2013chemical (electronic, optical, electrochemical, and electrocatalytical) properties [24]. Although, the photonic and electronics properties of Gr/MoS2 vertical heterostructures have been previously studied [25,26], those reports are focused on nanoelectronic transport mobilities and do not usually discuss the role of graphene in influencing the physicochemical properties. Besides, many theoretical studies have focused on the electronic properties and the formation of the Schottky barrier in the vdW heterostructures [27]. It is conceivable that the physical\u2013chemical properties and applications of the vdWHs depend on the stacking sequence of the constituent layers, the layer number, and the supporting platform. Computationally, Qiu et. al., [28] reported electronic and optical properties for Gr/MoS2(1L) heterostructures using density functional theory (DFT) [29,30] calculations and compared them with corresponding calculations from isolated graphene and MoS2 monolayers. The authors reported that a minigap appears at the graphene Dirac point of the Gr/MoS2, in agreement with other reports [31,32]. Moreover, they also reported that the absorption coefficient, refractive index, and the reflectance are redshifted in the heterostructure. The electronic properties of MoS2(1L)/Au (1 1 1) have been reported by Bruix et al. using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and DFT [33]. The authors found that the MoS2(1L) bandgap of MoS2/Au (1 1 1) is the same to those of the freestanding monolayer MoS2. Yortanli and Mete reported Gr/Au (1 1 1) electronic calculations, where they found a downward shift of the Fermi energy (EF ermi) with respect to graphene\u2019s Dirac point showing a p-type doping character [34]. However, we are not aware of a computational study of MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au heterointerfaces. In the present work, we consider the electronic and optical properties of the MoS2 layers and their heterostructures with graphene and gold heterointerfaces using DFT for calculating band structure, electronic density of states, surface work function, and resulting charge transfers at various interfaces. The frequency-dependent dielectric functions and reflectivity spectra are calculated in a large wavelength window useful for optoelectronics, quantum optics, and single-photon emitters for telecommunication. The real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function are related to the refractive index and the absorption coefficient, respectively. While the monolayer MoS2 is a direct semiconductor, and graphene is gapless, the MoS2/Gr heterostructure still reveals a direct bandgap somewhat than that of the monolayer MoS2. In the heterostructures, while the contribution of Mo-d orbitals to the conduction band is outstanding, the Mo-p, Mo-d, and C-p orbitals contribute to the valence band. The relocation and rehybridization of the orbital in the monolayer MoS2 to form a heterostructure with graphene brought interesting properties that can be applied in the phototransistors based on MoS2/Gr heterostructures. The computational findings are correlated with experimental optical (photoluminescence spectroscopy), vibrational properties (Raman spectroscopy), and work function from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) elucidating the effect graphene layer has on MoS2(1L) properties.  The experimental methods and measurements carried out are described briefly here, (see ref. [35] for details). We fabricated vertical heterostructures comprising of MoS2(1L) and graphene using an efficient dry transfer method on freshly prepared gold Au (1 1 1) coated SiO2/Si substrates imaged using electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We investigated optical (UV\u2013Visible absorption, photoluminescence-PL, and Raman spectroscopy) and electronic (work function and photoconductivity) properties to explore various surfaces and heterointerfaces to signify the interaction with Au substrate and graphene layer, the latter interspersed as \u2018nanospacer\u2019 to minimize PL quenching due to underneath gold and enhance photoconduction for optoelectronic properties and energy harvesting applications. The isolated monolayers 2H-MoS2 (MoS2-1L) and graphene (Gr) were generated as 4 \u00d7. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "4 P63/mmc supercell lattices, with lattice constants 12.76 \u00c5 and 9.87 \u00c5, respectively. The isolated MoS2(1L) supercell is three-layered totaling 48 atoms, with 32 S atoms occupying the top and bottom layers and 16 Mo atoms residing in the middle layer. The isolated graphene supercell has 32 atoms. Four-layer Au supercells, at the (1 1 1) crystallographic phase, were used. The Gr/MoS2 and MoS2/Gr/MoS2 heterostructures supercells were selected as 4 \u00d7 4 and 5 \u00d7 5 supercells for MoS2 and graphene, respectively, such that the lattice mismatch is small. Similar selection of supercells is used for the remaining structures of this work. Figs. 1 and 2 show the DFT optimized unit cells and the electronic structure for Gr/MoS2, Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr, for Gr/Au, and for MoS2(1L)/Au, MoS2(2L)/Au, and MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au, respectively. Simulations Design and Data Analysis: We performed DFT electronic structure calculations for the optimal geometries of various MoS2-graphene heterostructures and corresponding heterointerfaces with Au(1 1 1) using the periodic code Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [36\u201339]. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials were used [40,41]. The Kohn\u2013Sham equations were solved using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) under the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [42]. We used the D3 semiempirical correction by Grimme [43], which improves the DFT functionals descriptions for the long-range electron correlations responsible for van der Waals interactions. The kinetic energy cutoff for all calculations is 600\u00a0eV, thus ensuring the integrity of our results. The electronic band structures are plotted including the per atom and corresponding (s, p, d) orbital contributions. The convergence criteria for energy self-consistent field (SCF) and geometry optimizations were set at 10-9 eV and 10-4 eV/\u00c5 per atom, respectively. The Brillouin-zone (BZ) was sampled using the \u0393-centered 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1 BZ grid for all calculations in this work. For the isolated graphene, the denser 9 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 grid was also used. The work function \u03a6 was obtained from the equation: \u03a6=Evaccum-EFermi where Evaccum is obtained from the planar average potential calculations. Bader-type ion charges [44] were obtained using the Bader Charge Analysis code by Henkelman and co-workers [45\u201348], which partitions the charge density grid into Bader-type volumes. This code scales linearly with the number of grid points and can be used by large unit cells. Since the substrate and the interface with other 2D materials in 2D-MoS2 strongly affects the physical properties, it is natural to expect that it also provides vital effects on the optical properties. To study the optical properties computationally, we use the frequency-dependent dielectric function written as: \u03b5\u03c9=\u03b5R\u03c9+i\u03b5I\u03c9 where \u03b5R\u03c9 and \u03b5I\u03c9 are the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function, respectively, and \u03c9 being the photon energy. The imaginary part \u03b5I\u03c9 can be obtained computationally from the summation over the occupied and unoccupied states following the equation [49,50]: \u03b5Ii,j\u03c9=4\u03c02e2Vm2\u03c92\u2211c,v\u222bBZdk\u3008UckpiUvk\u3009\u3008UckpjUvk\u3009\u03b4(\u03c9ckk-\u03c9vkk-\u03c9) where e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively, V is the unit cell volume, p is the momentum operator, c and v are the conduction and vallence bands, respectively, Uck is the the crystal wave function, which corresponds to energy Eck, and j=x,y,z. The real part is calculated from the imaginary part via Kramers-Kronig relation: \u03b5R\u03c9=1+2\u03c0\u222b1\u03c9\u03c91\u03b5I\u03c91d\u03c91\u03c912-\u03c92. For compounds having hexagonal symmetry as opposed to cubic symmetry, the dielectric properties are performed with electric field parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis [51]. Thus, the measured dielectric functions are denoted by \u03b5(R,I)E||c and \u03b5(R,I)E\u22a5c and given by [51]: \u03b5E\u22a5c\u03c9=12\u03b5xx\u03c9+\u03b5yy\u03c9, \u03b5E||c\u03c9=\u03b5zz\u03c9 The corresponding refractive index n(\u03c9), the extinction coefficient k(\u03c9), and the reflectivity R(\u03c9) are given in terms of \u03b5R\u03c9,\u03b5I\u03c9,n\u03c9, and k\u03c9 following: n(\u03c9)=12[\u03b5R\u03c92+\u03b5I\u03c92]12+\u03b5R\u03c912 k\u03c9=12[\u03b5R\u03c92+\u03b5I\u03c92]12-\u03b5R\u03c912 or \u03b1\u03c9=2c\u03c9[\u03b5R\u03c92+\u03b5I\u03c92]12-\u03b5R\u03c912, (8\u2032). R(\u03c9)=\u03b5I\u03c9+\u03b5R\u03c9-1\u03b5I\u03c9+\u03b5R\u03c9+12=(n(\u03c9)-1)2+k(\u03c9)2(n(\u03c9)+1)2+k(\u03c9)2 The optical properties are calculated using the independent particle approximation (IPA) [52]. We also used the random phase approximation (RPA) [53] for graphene to check the accuracy of the IPA method. In general, RPA is superior to IPA. However, even for isolated graphene, RPA optical properties calculations requires huge RAM (>10\u00a0Tb) and thus it is impractical for being used by large supercells. All the calculations were run on the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC) supercomputer facilities, using the Stampede 2 and Lonestar 6 supercomputers.  Here, we discuss the electronic and optical properties of mono and bilayer MoS2 coupled with graphene and gold calculated using DFT for the optimized structures shown in Figs. 1 and 2. This study specifically focuses on the band structure, the density of states, the work function, the charge transfer, the frequency-dependent dielectric function, the refractive index, and the reflectivity. Isolated graphene. The DFT calculated dielectric functions for the isolated graphene and the MoS2 have been reported [54\u201360]. Here, we have also calculated the dielectric function \u03b5, the refractive index n, and the reflectivity R for the above-mentioned optimized geometries using the IPA (Fig. S1, Supplementary Materials). The use of a denser BZ grid reveals several peaks in the energy region 0 - 5\u00a0eV, for the in-plane polarization component of the imaginary part of graphene\u2019s dielectric function \u03b5IE\u22a5c. Marinopoulos et. al., have assigned these peaks to the interband \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions, whereas the peaks between 11.67 - 19.91\u00a0eV corresponds to the \u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2217 transitions [55]. Increased BZ grid minimally affects the peaks, which correspond to the \u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2217 transitions. Similarly, for the IPA calculations, the out of plane polarization \u03b5IE//c component shows peaks at 10.92\u00a0eV and 14.47\u00a0eV, which correspond to the interband \u03c0\u2192\u03c3\u2217 and \u03c3\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions, respectively [59]. Our isolated graphene in plane component of the dielectric constant (i.e., \u03b5RE\u22a5c0) is 5.63 and 7.46 for the IPA calculations under the 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1 and 9 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 BZ grids, respectively. The corresponding out of plane component \u03b5RE//c0 has a lower value of 1.56 for both type of grids. Our dielectric constant values comply with Rani et. al., who reported dielectric constant values of 7.6 and 1.25 for the in plane and out of plane components, respectively. Table 1 shows the energy locations from the \u03b5I(\u03c9) spectrum for the most prominent transitions of graphene and MoS2 for all systems studied in this work. The imaginary part of the dielectric function (\u03b5I) for the isolated graphene has. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "been also calculated using the random phase approximation (RPA) under the 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 1 BZ grid. The RPA includes crystalline local effects. These RPA calculations were performed using a coarser grid for the representation of the pseudo-orbitals, which is about half the size used in all other calculations (Fig. S2, Supplementary Materials). This is due to the RPA\u2019s high memory requirements. Fig. S2 shows an excellent agreement between IPA and RPA calculated \u03b5I for the in-plane polarization component (i.e., \u03b5IE\u22a5c). However, there are differences in the out of plane amplitudes \u03b5IE//c between these IPA and RPA calculations. This is in agreement with a past report, which emphasizes the role of local effects in the out of plane calculations [55]. The RPA and IPA calculations using the coarser grid for the representation of the pseudo-orbitals show a continuum spectrum for the in-plane polarization \u03b5IE\u22a5c, in agreement with past reports [54,59]. Isolated MoS2 monolayer. The imaginary part of dielectric function for the isolated MoS2 monolayer (MoS2-1L) shows peaks maxima at 2.89\u00a0eV and 5.48\u00a0eV, for in plane and out of plane components, respectively (Fig. S3a-S3b, Supplementary Materials). The \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) appears redshifted relative to \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9), in agreement with past work [28,61\u201363]. However, there are cases, that these spectra have been reported in a reverse order [57,64]. As it will be explained below, the MoS2(1L) maxima peaks from \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) and \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9) also appear in the Gr-MoS2 heterostructures, thus verifying the correctness of our approach. Figs. 1 and 2 show the optimized unit cells, their band structures, and the densities of states (DOS) for all heterostructures and heterointerfaces examined here. The \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) and \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9) peaks for the isolated MoS2(1L) correspond to the transitions namely, Modxy,x2-y2,Spz\u2192Modxy,x2-y2 and Modxz,zy,z2,Spx,y\u2192Modxz,zy,z2, respectively [58]. Our calculated MoS2 (1L) bandgap is 1.61\u00a0eV, which is close to the experimental value of 1.80\u00a0eV [4]. The high dielectric constant \u03b5R(0) out of plane component indicates that MoS2(1L) is suitable for solar cell applications [65], whereas the out of plane high refractive index of 3.73 at around 2.6\u00a0eV shows that MoS2(1L) can also serve as antireflection coating for flat panel displays. The MoS2(1L) high reflectivity shows that it is a good reflector from IR to UV (i.e., in a wider electromagnetic spectral window). The high value of the MoS2 refractive index in the visible (\u223c2.0 - 2.75\u00a0eV) make it suitable to serve as a heat preservation material. It is also noteworthy that such details on the optical properties are challenging to capture experimentally for all heterointerfaces examined here. Gr/MoS2 and Gr/MoS2/Gr heterostructures. The electronic band structure calculations for the heterostructures Gr/MoS2(1L), Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr, and the heterointerface MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au show the presence of the Dirac point at the Fermi energy (EFermi), located at the K point (Figs. 1-2, left panels). Interestingly for the Gr/Au case, the Dirac point is upshifted by about 0.17\u00a0eV, which is in an excellent agreement with the past report of Khomyakov et. al., [66] and indicative of physisorption of graphene on Au substrate. A small bandgap of the order of a few meV (minigap) is opened at the Dirac point for all graphene heterostructures in this work, as anticipated when monolayer graphene is placed on substrates. The presence of this minigap has also been reported previously for the Gr/MoS2(1L) heterointerface [31,32]. The MoS2(1L) bandgap is in the range of 1.27\u20131.77\u00a0eV (Figs. 1-2), which is close to the value for the isolated MoS2(1L) bandgap of 1.61\u00a0eV found here. While for more than one layer of MoS2(2L)/Au, the bandgap becomes indirect, as in the MoS2 bulk case [67]. We examine the changes in the optical properties for the isolated graphene and the MoS2(1L) due to their presence in the Gr/MoS2(1L) and Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures. Fig. 3 shows the frequency-dependent optical properties \u03b5, n, and R for all heterostructures and heterointerfaces of this work. The imaginary part of the dielectric function \u03b5I for the Gr/MoS2(1L) and Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures show peaks that correspond to transitions from graphene and MoS2. Table 1 shows that the locations of these peaks in both heterostructures are located at about the same energies to those from isolated monolayers, for both the in plane and out of plane light polarizations. Moreover, all graphene allowed transitions from the \u03c0 and \u03c3 bands towards the \u03c0\u2217 and \u03c3\u2217 bands are detected computationally in the \u03b5I spectra, for both Gr/MoS2(1L) and Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures. However, this is not the case for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au heterointerface, as it will be discussed later in this section. The peaks of these transitions appear at about the same positions as the ones from isolated graphene, in a similar fashion as the peaks that correspond to transitions involving MoS2. This implies that the overlap between graphene and MoS2(1L) bands is rather small. The larger values of dielectric constants for the heterostructures relative to the isolated monolayers manifests that they are better dielectrics than those of isolated MoS2 and graphene. However, the in-plane component of the dielectric constant for the Gr/MoS2 is smaller than from Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr, whereas the opposite is observed for the out of plane polarization. The heterostructures refractive index spectra are redshifted relative to the one for the isolated monolayers. This agrees with the past report by Qiu et al., on the DFT calculated optical properties for Gr/MoS2 [28], as well as with our experimental optical absorption and photoluminescence properties (Figs. 4-5 ). Moreover, in the visible region, the Gr/MoS2 has a higher refractive index value relative to the isolated MoS2(1L), whereas the opposite is observed for the Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr configuration. These results agree with those reported by Qiu et al.[28]. Therefore, the Gr/MoS2 is an improved material for heat preservation applications relative to the isolated MoS2 (1L). The reflectivity of the Gr/MoS2(1L)/Gr is smaller than for Gr/MoS2(1L) energies up to about 11\u00a0eV for both the in plane and out of plane components. An exception to the above statement is observed for the in-plane reflectivity at energies less than 0.6\u00a0eV, where we found the following order: RGr/MoS2(1L)<RGr/MoS2(1L)/Gr. The Gr/MoS2(1L) heterostructure will reflect light better in a wide optical region, since it\u2019s out of plane. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "reflectivity is larger as compared with those found for the isolated graphene and MoS2. MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces. The \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) component for the MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces shows peaks at about 1.52\u00a0eV, which are absent from the corresponding spectra for the isolated MoS2 monolayer. Johnson and Christy reported the dielectric function for Cu, Ag, and Au through reflection and transition measurements at room temperature [68]. The authors reported that the Au dielectric function imaginary part shows a curve that peaks at about 1.0\u00a0eV. In our case, the \u03b5IE\u22a5c associated with Au intraband transition from the Au valance bands to the Au-Mo conduction bands peak occurs at about 1.57\u00a0eV. For MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and Gr/Au, two peaks appear at 1.2\u00a0eV and 2\u00a0eV, which are associated with the Au intraband transitions, which involve graphene bands. There are significant differences in the real part of the dielectric function \u03b5R(\u03c9) between the MoS2(1L)/Au and the MoS2(2L)/Au, where the MoS2(1L)/Au \u03b5RE//c spectrum is comparable to the one from the isolated MoS2(1L). The dielectric constant for the MoS2(2L)/Au is significantly higher than the MoS2(1L)/Au, which implies that an additional MoS2 layer on top of MoS2(1L)/Au improves the heterostructure\u2019s dielectric properties, as expected. However, both heterointerfaces have similar refractive index n and reflectivity R values, for energies up to about 6\u00a0eV. The out of plane component of the refractive index n for the MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces is significantly larger than the corresponding value for the isolated MoS2(1L) and for the Gr-MoS2 heterostructures examined above, for energies up to about 1.6\u00a0eV, with nMoS2(1L)/Au>nMoS2(2L)/Au, with the MoS2(1L)/Au nE//c being the highest for all configurations of this work. This makes the MoS2(1L-2)/Au and Gr/Au materials useful for thermal (IR) coatings. MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and Gr/Au heterointerfaces. It was experimentally observed that freshly prepared gold coated Si substrate, used for investigating the exfoliated graphene and MoS2, influences their physical properties (Figs. 4-5) [7,35,69,70]. Here, we investigated computationally how Au influenced graphene optical properties for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and the Gr/Au heterointerfaces. Specifically, the \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au and Gr/Au shows several peaks in the energy range 0.99 - 2.68\u00a0eV and 0.69 - 2.39\u00a0eV, respectively, which correspond to the \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions. However, the \u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2217 transitions cannot be identified from heterointerfaces \u03b5IE\u22a5c(\u03c9) spectra. The intense peaks at about 1.2\u00a0eV and 2\u00a0eV in the \u03b5IE//c(\u03c9), which involve transitions within the Au bands mixed with graphene bands for the MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au case, are corroborated with experimental observations reflected in the changes in the optical emission peaks through redshifts, as well as in the vibrational bands due to stronger electron\u2013phonon coupling (vide infra). The MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au has the highest dielectric constant from all materials examined here, which makes MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au a suitable material candidate for photovoltaic solar cell applications. The out of plane component of the reflectivity for the Gr/Au heterointerface showed its highest value at about 2.25\u00a0eV from all structures of this work. Charge transfer and work function. Table 2 summarizes the charges per Mo, S, C, and Au relative to their isolated atoms charges and the work function for all configurations studied in this work. In all configurations, there is some small electron transfer per atom from graphene to Au and MoS2, which makes graphene is a p-type semiconductor in the heterostructures and heterointerfaces. Similarly, there is a charge transfer from Au to MoS2, which makes MoS2 an n-type semiconductor. However, electron transfers from graphene do not correspond to shifts of the Dirac point relative to the Fermi energy, except for the Gr/Au case, in agreement with past reports [34,66]. Thus, charge transfers between graphene and Au and MoS2 do not necessarily correspond to Dirac point shifts. The work function for the isolated MoS2 is larger than the one for the isolated graphene, which is not surprising since MoS2(1L) is a semiconductor and graphene is a semimetal. Moreover qualitatively, the higher the work function the lower the electrical conductivity. The MoS2(1L-2L) adsorption on Au decreases the MoS2(1L) bandgap and its work function value relative to the isolated MoS2(1L), indicating an improved conductivity for the MoS2(1L-2L)/Au heterointerfaces. The MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au has the highest work function from all heterostructures and heterointerfaces in this work. This indicates that the presence of graphene between MoS2(1L)/Au interface changes the conductivity, such that it becomes useful for photoconductive properties (see Fig. 4) and for devising range of optoelectronic devices. We further expand on correlating the above calculations with experimental findings, and discuss the results related to the work function, the photoconductivity, and the lattice vibrational and optical properties. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images (panels a and b), the optical image (panel c) and the AFM topography (panel d) identifying various surfaces and heterointerfaces and unambiguously visualizes layer numbers through contrast for both graphene and MoS2, as well as MoS2/Gr heterostructures. Here, we measured electronic and optical surface properties to probe buried interfaces for MoS2 on Au and MoS2 on graphene. The AFM topography was measured in combination with KPFM obtaining contact potential difference (CPD) showing regions with dark (MoS2) and bright (graphene or gold) contrast levels. The average CPD was determined through measuring the distribution over nanoregions (Fig. 4f). The work function was calculated using the following eVCPD\u00a0=\u00a0\u03a6tip\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03a6sample, where VCPD in volts, \u03a6tip is tip work function calibrated with HOPG, \u03a6sample is of samples and e the electron charge. These values are summarized and plotted in Fig. 4h along with computational values, which are in reasonable agreement with experiment. The tunable work function of MoS2 (1L and 2L)/Au (1 1 1) was calculated to be 4.80\u00a0eV and 4.772\u00a0eV. The work function of the MoS2/Gr heterostructure decreased depending upon the number of graphene layers ranged between 40 and 70\u00a0meV confirming charge transfer from graphene to MoS2 at 2D-MoS2/graphene heterostructures. Partial change of work function values is attributed to the interface dipole between graphene and MoS2 and the electron density redistribution. Fig. 4g shows conductive AFM (C-AFM) measuring local photo-conductive mapping under laser illumination. The contrast is due to photocurrent modulation of local electric field at the barrier interface, wherein the concentration of charged carriers is varied due to the injection of electrons upon laser. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "illumination. These findings manifested in optimal electronic coupling of dissimilar 2D layers layered materials for light energy harvesting [71]. The lattice vibration properties were also probed using confocal Raman spectroscopy [72,73]. Recall that the space group of a single layer MoS2 is P63/mmc (point group D3 h). Consequently, systems with even numbers of layers belong to the space group P3m1 (with inversion symmetry) and systems with odd numbers of layers to the P63/mmc space group (without inversion symmetry) [74]. The first- and second-order Raman spectra (Fig. 5a) highlight signatures associated with planar MoS2 flakes and mono-/bilayer graphene layers, both on Au, and MoS2 heterostructured interface with the underlying graphene layer. Briefly, the prominent vibrational bands associated with MoS2 include the in-plane E\u2019(E2g1 for bulk) mode at 384.0\u00a0cm\u22121 (383.8) and out-of-plane A1\u2032 (A1g for bulk) mode at 403.4\u00a0cm\u22121 (404.5), with frequency difference \u0394f\u00a0=\u00a019.5\u00a0cm\u22121 for mono- (1L) and 20.8\u00a0cm\u22121 for bilayer (2L) consistent with the most of the literature values [4,35]. The spectra in Fig. 5a (middle panel) are related to graphene and interfaces showing a characteristic G band at 1580\u00a0cm\u22121 associated with the in-plane tangential mode. The disorder-activated D band at about\u00a01340\u00a0cm\u22121 was almost absent. The overtone 2D peak\u00a0\u223c\u00a02670\u00a0cm\u22121 (Fig. 5a, last panel) exhibits frequencies and line shapes matching the characteristic mono or bilayer graphene [3,35]. While the in-plane vibration provides information about in-plane strain, out-of-plane mode provides evidence on the quality of the interfacial contacts. Notably, compared to the MoS2 (1L-2L)/Au, the E\u2019 and A1\u2032 mode was red shifted by 1.0\u00a0cm\u22121 and blue shifted by 1.6\u20132.0\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. In the case of the MoS2/Gr heterostructure, the vdWH contact is also characterized by a shift of 12\u201313\u00a0cm\u22121 in the graphene 2D peak. These result from the interlayer interactions with underlying graphene indicates doping of MoS2 monolayer. However, the position of the G band was almost invariant within the uncertainty of the Raman instrumental resolution (less than1 cm\u22121). The optical properties were studied by UV\u2013Visible absorption (Fig. 5b) and photoluminescence (PL) emission (Fig. 5c) spectroscopy. The absorption spectrum yields a reliable measurement of the bandgap either in configuration space or in light scattering momentum space. An obvious broad peak located at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0230\u00a0nm (and 268\u00a0nm) is related to graphene, which differs from larger flakes of 2D-MoS2 that shows peaks at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0620\u00a0nm and\u00a0\u223c\u00a0668\u00a0nm (1.856\u00a0eV) ascribed to B and A neutral excitonic peaks, respectively, arising from the K point BZ [4,14,35,69,70]. The \u03c0\u2192\u03c0\u2217 transitions in the absorbance data are detected at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0250\u00a0nm, which is equivalent to about 4.6\u00a0eV. The strongest luminescence peak at 450\u00a0nm (2.76\u00a0eV) is due to direct transitions from deep valence to conduction band, which shifts with excitation wavelength. The room temperature PL spectra also shows a neutral exciton (A) peak at 1.885\u00a0eV, for MoS2(1L)/Au. This finding is in contrast with the reported observation of quenching of PL signal, which we attributed to conformal contact of MoS2 with Au [10,75,76]. On the other hand, exciton A peak intensity becomes stronger two to four times on graphene layers than those when placed on Au. The red shift in A peak transition energy by 43\u00a0meV is observed for MoS2(1L)/Gr(1L) heterostructures (Fig. 5c). The crystalline flakes comprised in these heterostructures are randomly misoriented and therefore it is likely the interaction between MoS2, and graphene is weak. The observed shifts and the enhanced PL signal arise due to the interaction with graphene \u2018nanospacer\u2019 resulting in direct changes in the MoS2 electronic structure as observed through calculations. Furthermore, the spectral shape of the exciton A is modified such that the emergence of the charged exciton (or trion) peak (A-) is observed peaking at 1.835\u00a0eV for MoS2(1L)/Gr heterostructures, yielding trion binding energy of 30\u00a0meV, slightly higher than those for MoS2 (ca. 20\u00a0meV) and is suggestive of robust excitons at room temperature. These can be exploited for exciton-photonics technologies, such as quantum sensing and light-energy harvesting. An obvious exciton splitting is attributed to built-in electric field at the MoS2/Gr interface regardless of the number of graphene layers. Our experimental results directly and/or indirectly support the optical and electronic properties inferred from calculated band structure, the work function, and the optical properties. The PL spectra can be used to determine changes in the MoS2 bandgaps. This is in a similar fashion as used by Weber and Alonso for determining bandgaps from PL spectra on Si-Ge alloys [77]. Fig. 5c shows that the addition of a second MoS2 monolayer on top of MoS2/Au decreases the bandgap, in agreement with our calculations. This is due to the change of the monolayer MoS2 (1L) bandgap from direct to indirect in the bilayer MoS2 (2L). However, the change in the absorbance is a better approach for determining bandgap changes relative to using the PL spectra. The absorbance data shows that the absorbance peak for MoS2(1L)/Au is observed at higher wavelengths (smaller eV) than the one from the MoS2/Gr/Au. This means that the MoS2 bandgap is less in units of eV for the MoS2(1L)/Au relative to MoS2(1L)/Gr/Au, in agreement with our calculations. However, the PL spectra showed otherwise albeit marginally.  In summary, we performed DFT calculations in MoS2 and graphene heterointerfaces placed on Au and their heterostructures to unravel the electronic band structure and density of states per atom energy and their work function, as well as their optical properties. We also complemented these calculations with experimental findings, specifically correlated with surface work function and optical photoluminescence bands, highlighting the interaction of the MoS2 with the Au substrate and graphene. The frequency-dependent dielectric function, the refractive index, and the reflectivity were calculated for light polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of respective top nanolayer in heterointerfaces and heterostructures. The calculated electronic and optical properties were in reasonable agreement with the past computational reports and with our experimental results. The insertion of graphene layer in-between gold and MoS2 (or vice versa) has significant effects on their electronic and optical behavior despite the weak interlayer interaction. Consequently, interfacing MoS2 with graphene signifies engineered manipulation of physical properties thereby paving the way for their applications in diverse technologies from semiconductors to. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "light energy harvesting and electrocatalysis.

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apmt.2020.100616.txt", "paper": ["Tungsten oxide is a versatile material which has been used in a wide variety of applications due to its extraordinary properties. Introducing mesoporosity to tungsten oxide has expanded the range of applications in the fields of gas sensing [], electrochromic devices [], optical devices [], solar cells [,], and catalysis []. The higher activities are obtained by the formation of nano-sized particles with high surface area and tunable pore sizes. Thus, researchers have introduced many different methods to maximize the surface area while maintaining the mesoporosity. However, the surface areas reported are in the range of 5\u2013145 m2/g [,,,,,,,]. The natural components of crude oil consist of a small amount of potentially harmful sulfur compounds in the forms of thiols, sulfides, disulfides, and thiophenes []. It is important to remove these organosulfur compounds during refining processes as the presence of sulfur can cause harm to catalytic converters of exhaust systems, corrode surfaces, and can produce toxic species upon combustion [,]. The harmful sulfur oxides (SOx) can cause acid rain, smog, and respiratory disorders [,]. The conventional sulfur removal method used in industry is hydrodesulfurization (HDS) which requires the use of hydrogen, high temperatures (300\u2013360 \u00b0C), high pressures (3\u20135 MPa), and expensive catalysts (CoMo/Al2O3, NiMo/Al2O3 etc.) []. Moreover, HDS is more suitable for the removal of sulfur in the forms of thiols and sulfides. HDS is inefficient in removing thiophenes, specially dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) [,]. Thus, as an alternative method, oxidative desulfurization (ODS) has been introduced which consist of two steps. First, the organosulfur compounds are oxidized to sulfones or sulfoxides in the presence of a catalyst and an oxidant (organic peroxyacids, nitric acid, ozone, potassium superoxide pressurized molecular oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide) []. Then the polar sulfone or sulfoxide is extracted from the non-polar crude oil. The common catalysts used for ODS are iron (III) complexes [], Fenton-like catalysts [], emulsion catalysts [], metal oxo anion incorporated layered double hydroxides [], polyoxometalates [,,], zeolites [], and metal oxides supported on silica/titania [,]. However, the aforementioned studies have disadvantages such as difficulties in catalyst separation (homogeneous catalysts), poor catalyst reusability, high reaction temperatures, longer reaction times, low yields, and limited substrate scope. Herein, high surface area, multi-valent, mesoporous WO3 synthesized using a novel metal dissolution approach is used for the oxidation of thiophenes under green reaction conditions. Hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidant, which has a high oxygen content (47%) and produces water as a byproduct.  The catalyst, mesoporous tungsten oxide (WO3) was synthesized via the recently reported novel metal dissolution approach combined with reverse micelle formation []. At lower calcination temperatures (250 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C) the materials were amorphous and upon heating up to 450 \u00b0C, the crystallinity increased and monoclinic WO3 (PDF card No. 01-083-0950) was observed (Fig. 1 a). The aforementioned results were further confirmed by SEM (Fig. 1b\u2013d) analyses. At lower calcination temperatures the surfaces of the micro spheres which are made of tungsten oxide nanoparticles are smooth. Upon heating, well defined nano-sized particles were observed on the surface of the micro spheres. The HR-TEM analyses further confirmed the increase in crystallinity upon heating. Tungsten oxide calcined at 250 \u00b0C showed an amorphous nature in the HR-TEM images (Fig. 1e, f) and diffuse rings in SAED patterns (Fig. 1g). When the material is calcined at 450 \u00b0C, lattice fringes were observed in the HR-TEM images (Fig. 1h, i) and bright spots were seen in the SAED pattern (Fig. 1h) due to increased crystallinity. The BET analyses (Fig. 2 a) showed tungsten oxide calcined at 250 \u00b0C has the highest surface area (209 m2/g) and upon heating, the surface areas decreased (Table S1) due to sintering. The average pore diameters increased from 2.0 to 9.6 nm upon increasing the calcination temperature (Fig. 2b). The presence of multiple oxidation states in the material was observed in the XP spectra of W4f (Fig. 2c, d). The spin doublet at 34.5 and 36.6 eV corresponds to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of W5+. The bands corresponding to W6+ are observed at 35.7 (4f7/2) and 37.8 eV (4f5/2) []. The XP spectra of oxygen showed bands corresponding to lattice oxygen (O2\u2212) which were observed at 530.3 eV and bands at 531.2 and 531.5 eV are due to the oxygen species adsorbed on the surface (O2 2\u2212, O\u2212 of defect sites, and OH\u2212) [,]. The oxidation of thiophenes catalyzed by mesoporous tungsten oxide catalyst in the presence of H2O2 was performed by using dibenzothiophene (DBT) as the substrate (Scheme S1). The complete oxidation of DBT with 99% yield occurred within 15 min at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). The products were analyzed using GCMS, 1H, and 13C NMR (Fig. S1). For comparison, 1H and 13C NMR data of dibenzothiophene were obtained (Fig. S2). As a blank experiment, the reaction was carried out without the catalyst and the oxidant where no products were obtained. When one experiment with only the catalyst (no oxidant) and another experiment with only the oxidant (no catalyst) was carried out, no oxidation was observed. Thus, this confirms the importance of both oxidant and the catalyst for the formation of dibenzothiophene sulfone (DBTO2). The effect of catalyst loading, amount of H2O2 used, and solvent type were studied. The substrate scope and substituent effects were evaluated using GCMS data.  Tungsten oxide calcined at 250 \u00b0C showed the highest yield as and the highest surface area, thus the highest number of active sites. When the amount of catalyst is increased, the maximum yield was observed when 20 mg of tungsten oxide is used (Fig. S3). The increment of the number of active sites causes higher yields upon increasing the catalyst loading. The amount of oxidant added plays an important role in oxidation reactions. Theoretically, the ratio between DBT:H2O2 is 1:2. However, experimentally, a higher amount of H2O2 is needed for the oxidation of DBT as the oxidant is decomposed at ambient conditions. Upon increasing the amount of H2O2 added, the yield of DBTO2 increased (Fig.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "S4). When the molar ratio of DBT:H2O2 is 1:10 the maximum yield (>99%) was obtained. Unlike other studies [], the thermal decomposition of the H2O2 does not affect the rate of oxidation in this study since the reaction is conducted at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). The reaction proceeds only in the presence of the polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile. When toluene or ethanol were used as the solvent no oxidation is observed. The nucleophilicity of the polar solvent plays a major role in the reaction mechanism. Bregante et al. reported the oxidation rate decreases in the order of acetonitrile > p-dioxane \u223c acetone > ethanol \u223c methanol []. Solvents with high nucleophilicity competes for active sites and inhibits the activation of activation of H2O2 by the metal centers. The oxidation reaction follows first order reaction kinetics which is in agreement with previous reports [,]. The activation energy calculated for the reaction using the Arrhenius equation is 75.0 kJ/mol (Fig. S5). Furthermore, the catalyst did not leach into the system as the reaction did not proceed when the catalyst was removed after 5 min (Fig. S6). The catalyst was reusable up to 5 reaction cycles without losing significant activity (Fig. S7). After one reaction cycle, the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture and washed with ethanol followed by vacuum drying. The experiment done to mimic crude oil by using a model oil showed excellent yield (>99%) and selectivity (>99%). The substituent effect and substrate scope on the oxidation of organosulfur compounds were evaluated by using different organosulfur compounds (Table 1 ). To investigate the substituent effect, 4-methyldibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMBT) were used. 1-Benzothiophene (1-BT) and its substituted versions were used as another set of substrates. The products were analyzed using GCMS and 1H NMR (Figs. S8\u2013S12). Furthermore, thiol and its derivatives were used as additional substrates. The catalytic activity on the oxidation is decreased in the order of DBT > 4,6-DMBT > 1-BT where the complete oxidation occurred within 15, 30, and 60 min respectively (Fig. S13). The reactivity of the organosulfur compounds plays a major role in the oxidation ability. Thus, electronic density around the sulfur atoms and steric hindrance cause the differences observed in the oxidation rate [,,]. The catalyst was tested with a mixture of multiple organosulfur compounds present in the same model oil. The components used were dibenzothiophene, 4,6-dimethyldimenzothiophene, and 1-benzothiophene where the yields of the oxidized products were >99%, >99%, and 98% respectively. A plausible mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of organosulfur compounds is proposed (Scheme S2) using the experimental results obtained in this study and literature reports [,]. The first step would be the activation of H2O2 by mesoporous tungsten oxide. A nucleophilic attack by H2O2 occurs on the catalyst (a) followed by the reversible removal of a water molecule results in a hydroperoxytungstate species (c). The coordination of the peroxo group to the high valent W6+ produces an electrophilically activated state. Thus, the next step, nucleophilic attack by the sulfur atom of DBT (1) on the peroxo group occurs efficiently. This regenerates the catalyst and produces a sulfoxide species (2) with only one oxygen atom bound to sulfur. Another cycle of the aforementioned reaction series would occur releasing another water molecule, DBTO2 (3) and the catalyst in its original form. The suggested mechanism is supported by the substituent effect and the substrate scope. When the electron density of the sulfur atom is higher, the oxidation rate is high. When H2 18O2 was used as the oxidant, the oxidized product, DBTO2 with both 18O atoms was observed which was confirmed by the mass fragment patterns in GCMS data (Fig. S14). Thus, the proposed mechanism is further supported. The regeneration of the catalyst without significant changes in the structure and electronic properties were confirmed by the post catalytic characterization data (Figs. S15\u2013S18).  In this study, a high surface area (209 m2/g), multi-valent mesoporous tungsten oxide was synthesized to be used as a heterogeneous catalyst by the novel metal dissolution coupled with a reverse micelle formation approach. The synthesized material showed excellent activity towards the oxidation of organosulfur compounds with >99% yield. The fast reaction time (15 min), ambient conditions (20 \u00b0C), use of a clean oxidant (H2O2), and the production of environmentally benign non-toxic by products (water) make this a green process.  The recently reported novel metal dissolution approach [] was used for the synthesis of mesoporous tungsten oxide where 0.02 mol of tungsten metal was dissolved in 16 ml (excess) of 30% H2O2. The excess H2O2 was evaporated by heating until the volume was reduced in half. The resultant was added to a mixture of 14 ml of 1-butanol and 2.5 g conc. HNO3 followed by stirring for 30 min. Then, 2.5 g of Pluronic 123 was added and was stirred overnight. The resultant sol was heated at 120 \u00b0C in an oven to evaporate the solvent and the solid product was washed with ethanol. The resultant was calcined at 150 \u00b0C, 250 \u00b0C, 350 \u00b0C, and 450 \u00b0C for 12 h, 3 h, 2 h, and 1 h respectively. In a typical catalytic reaction, 0.1 mmol dibenzothiophene, 1 mmol of H2O2, and 0.5 ml of acetonitrile were stirred with 20 mg of the catalyst. After the separation by filtration, the products were isolated by evaporating acetonitrile at room temperature. Then the resultant yellow colored crystals (Fig. S19) were analyzed using GCMS (in the presence of tetradecane as the internal standard), 1H, and 13C NMR. To mimic crude oil, a model solution was created by dissolving DBT in n-octane (500 ppm). Then, 5 ml acetonitrile was added to 10 ml of the model oil and the catalytic oxidation was performed. dibenzothiophene sulfone: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN, \u03b4): 7.97 (d, 2 H), 7.83 (d, 2 H), 7.73 (t, 2 H), 7.60 (t, 2 H); 13C NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN, \u03b4): 121.6, 122.4, 130.8, 131.4, 134.3, 137.6  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Recent research has further advanced to the efforts to develop suitable materials that will substitute indium tin oxide (ITO). Among many candidates based on SnO2 and ZnO , Al-doped ZnO (AZO) is regarded as one of the most outstanding functional materials because of its non-toxicity, high thermal stability, durability against hydrogen plasma, and low cost in addition to its low electrical resistivity (\u223c10\u22124 \u03a9 cm) and high transparency (\u223c85%) in the visible wavelengths . AZO films can be prepared by typical thin film deposition techniques including dc and rf sputtering , pulsed laser deposition , reactive magnetron sputtering , and vacuum arc plasma evaporation . While scalability problem may be encountered with these techniques, pulsed dc magnetron sputtering (PDMS) technique has been recently introduced as a suitable method to prepare high-quality films at large scale and high yield by combining advantageous features of dc and rf magnetron sputtering . Advantages of PDMS include high sputtering yield with high plasma density, long-term process stability, coincident sputtering with evaporation from a partially molten target, and high growth rate without degradation of film quality. These unique characteristics of the PDMS are appropriate for the production of AZO films for transparent electrodes with high performance . Although there have been a few reports on the preparation of the AZO films by PDMS, further systematic studies are still required . In this study, effect of the deposition temperature on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of AZO TCO films fabricated by a PDMS has been investigated. At the same time, applicability of the AZO films to thin-film solar cells has been considered by observing the surface-texturing of the films in wet etching and the resulting optical characteristics. Lowest resistivity of 4.16 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm with the transmittance of over 90% was achieved when the film was deposited at 230 \u00b0C. Further, low reflectance of 2.428% and high rms roughness of 54 nm were obtained after etching the film in HCl solution without degradation of electrical resistivity, thereby suggesting that the AZO films prepared by PDMS is suitable for moth-eye structured antireflective transparent electrodes for thin-film solar cells.  AZO films were deposited on glass substrates in a high vacuum chamber which was initially pumped down to 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 Torr with a turbo molecular pump. The working pressure was maintained at 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 Torr with an Ar gas supply at 30 sccm. A cylindrical ZnO target (250 mm in length and 45 mm in diameter) having the composition of 2 wt% Al was used as the source. Such cylindrical target geometry provides a return path for electrons during each pulse-off phase, which allows the enhanced target efficiency as compared to planar target configurations. The distance between the target and the substrate was about 95 mm and the scan speed of the substrate holder was 15.6 mm/s. The AZO films were deposited to the thickness of 850\u2013950 nm applying the deposition temperatures varying from 150 to 280 \u00b0C. The sputtering power and the pulse frequency were fixed at 2 kW and 70 kHz, respectively. In order to examine the applicability of the AZO films to antireflective TCOs having a moth-eye structure for thin-film solar cells, the films were wet-etched in a 0.5 wt% HCl solution for 30 s, which created the randomly textured surface. The surface morphology of the deposited AZO films was characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4200) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, PARKXE-100). The structural properties were examined with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2500H) using a Cu K\u03b1 radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS NOVA) was also employed to analyze the chemical compositions of the films. Transmittance and reflectance of the films were measured using a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, V-570). Electrical properties of the films were measured via Hall measurement system with van der Pauw configuration at room temperature.  The SEM micrographs in Fig. 1 show the morphology of the AZO films deposited at various temperatures (150\u2013280 \u00b0C) by PDMS in 45\u00b0 tilt view. It can be seen that the AZO films have well-aligned columnar structures. As the deposition temperature increases, the films morphology evolves toward densely packed columnar structure with decreasing surface roughness as shown in Fig. 1(a\u2013e). Fig. 2 shows the XRD spectra of the AZO films deposited at different temperatures. All the films exhibit strong peaks attributed to the (0 0 2) and (0 0 4) planes of hexagonal ZnO indicating that they have c-axis preferred orientation due to self-texturing phenomenon . It is noticed in these XRD spectra that with increasing deposition temperatures to 230 \u00b0C, the peak intensities gradually increase and the peak positions are shifted to larger angles. Increasing peak intensities implies that the crystallinity of the films improves with higher deposition temperature. Shifted peak positions to higher diffraction angle indicate that the inter-planar distance between the (0 0 2) planes decrease. This is ascribed to the increasing degree of substitution of Zn2+ ions with Al3+ ions since the ionic radius of Al3+ (0.53 \u00c5) is smaller than that of Zn2+ (0.75 \u00c5) . The XRD spectra in Fig. 2 also show that the AZO films grow without the formation of secondary phases and clusters such as Al2O3 and amorphous ZnO although traces of ZnO (1 0 0) and (1 0 3) peaks were observed. When the deposition temperature increases further to 280 \u00b0C, the intensities of the (0 0 2), (0 0 4), and (1 0 0) peaks decrease. Noting that the substrate temperature for the columnar growth is in the range of 80\u2013290 \u00b0C under rf sputtering and that our PDMS system gives higher plasma density to the film surface, it is presumed that the columnar grains begin to change their grain structure at relatively high deposition temperature resulting in such deteriorative behaviors . The crystalline sizes which can be. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "estimated using the Scherrer's equation are in the range of 15\u201316 nm. In order to investigate the effect of deposition temperature on the chemical states of the ZnO containing dopant Al, the XPS spectra for oxygen shown in Fig. 3 are analyzed. The O1s spectra shown in Fig. 3 can be deconvoluted into two subpeaks at 530.1 \u00b1 0.15 eV (peak I) and 531.25 \u00b1 0.15 eV (peak II) which are assigned to the O2\u2212 ions surrounded by Zn2+ or Al3+ ions in the wurtzite structure (O-I) and the O2\u2212 ions in the oxygen deficient regions within the ZnO matrix (O-II), respectively . The area fractions of these peaks are summarized in Table 1 . In Fig. 3 and Table 1, it can be seen that the intensity of O-I peak increases as the deposition temperature increases to 230 \u00b0C. Increasing contribution from the lattice O2\u2212 ions, i.e. stoichiometric O2\u2212 ions, accompanied by decreasing contribution from the oxygen deficiency, indicates that the increasing deposition temperature to moderate range (230 \u00b0C in this case) resulted in improved crystalline quality as well as the doping efficiency (increasing number of substitutional Al). However, at a higher temperature of 280 \u00b0C, the peak intensity due to the stoichiometric O2\u2212 ions decreases, suggesting that some of oxygen atoms might have been diffused and reacted with impurity atoms such as hydrogen, sodium, silicon from the glass substrate . The XPS results have good correlations to the changes in structural characteristics deduced from the XRD spectra in Fig. 2. The optical transmittance of the AZO films measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer is shown in Fig. 4 . All the films are highly transparent to visible light with the average transmittance higher than 80% while it increases slightly with higher deposition temperature up to 230 \u00b0C. In particular, the transmittance at 550 nm is between 87% and 94%, which satisfies the requirement for the transparent electrodes. The increase in transmittance with higher deposition temperature originates from the improved crystallinity. The optical bandgap energies of the films estimated from the absorption edges in the transmittance spectra increase from 3.57 eV to 3.69 eV with increasing the deposition temperature to 230 \u00b0C. While these values are larger than that of undoped ZnO (3.3 eV) , the blue-shift of the absorption edges is attributed to Burstein-Moss effect , i.e. increasing carrier concentration in the conduction band and resulting shift in Fermi level to higher energy regime. In addition to high transparency, it is necessary that the AZO films should possess sufficiently low electrical resistivity for transparent electrode applications. Fig. 5 shows the electrical properties of the AZO films in terms of the carrier concentration, Hall mobility of the carriers, and resistivity as functions of deposition temperature. The carrier concentrations increase moderately with increasing deposition temperature up to 230 \u00b0C although the sputtering target has the fixed Al concentration of 2 wt%. This is related to the improved doping efficiency that can be deduced from the XRD and XPS spectra and from the Burstein-Moss of the absorption edges. Concerning the Hall mobility of carriers, it increases substantially from 4.4 to 11.3 cm2/V s as the deposition temperature increases to 230 \u00b0C, which could be understood in terms of the enhanced crystallinity. At a higher temperature of 280 \u00b0C, the mobility decreases to 7.6 cm2/V s due to the degradation of the crystallinity in the films that would multiply the number of scattering centers. As a result, the electrical resistivity rapidly decreases from 1.22 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 4.16 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm which satisfies the requirement for transparent electrodes. In thin-film solar cells, efficient light scattering is essential to enhance the absorbance of silicon . Wet etching is a simple but effective and scalable method to produce a surface-textured structure of the AZO films for improved light trapping . The AFM images shown in Fig. 6(a and b) compare the surface morphology of the AZO films deposited at 230 \u00b0C before and after the wet etching treatment. After etching, the film has a crater-like structure with the rms roughness of 54 nm whereas the surface of the film before etching is relatively smooth with the rms roughness of 6 nm (Table 2 ). Formation of the crater-like structure by the wet etching reduced the average specular reflectance of the etched film from 14.194% to 2.428% at 550 nm (Fig. 6(c)). Such reduction of the reflectance is attributed to increased light scattering from the surface craters. Meanwhile, the electrical resistivity of the etched film was measured to be 5.69 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm showing that the etching process did not cause significant degradation of the electrical properties. The results presented above suggest that the wet-etched AZO film prepared at 230 \u00b0C appears to have the desirable characteristics with the enhanced light-scattering capability for transparent electrode applications, especially in thin-film solar cells.  In summary, the AZO films were prepared by PDMS applying various deposition temperatures and were subsequently wet-etched to texture the surface for solar cell applications. Increasing the deposition temperature to a moderate level (230 \u00b0C in this study) accompanied improved crystalline quality and doping efficiency which yielded the lowest electrical resistivity of 4.16 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm with the desirable transmittance of \u223c90% in the wavelength range of 200\u2013800 nm. When wet-etched, crater-like structures formed on the surface of the AZO film deposited at 230 \u00b0C increased the surface roughness significantly, which resulted in the enhanced light-scattering capability as revealed in the reduced reflectance to 2.428%. It is thus suggested that the combination of PDMS and wet etching technique enables large-scale production of surface-textured AZO films possessing the superior properties which would be a low-cost indium-free alternative to ITO for anti-reflective electrodes in thin-film solar cells.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Among other, in case of optical applications, niobium oxide based materials are often used as high index and low loss materials for e.g., optical waveguides , interference filters, antireflective coatings or electroluminescent devices . The most stable form of niobium oxides is niobia (Nb2O5) and it is very attractive for electronic applications. Nb2O5, along with other oxides of metals from the Vth group, have also been investigated as possible candidates for thin film catalysts and corrosion barrier coatings . Recently, there has also been a considerable interest in using the niobia as high permittivity dielectric to replace the existing gate oxides in microelectronic devices . Due to the exceptional thermal stability and mechanical resistance of Nb2O5 compared to traditional high permittivity materials, such thin films are very attractive candidates for the above mentioned applications . This material has also been appointed as a substitute of tantalum pentoxide (\u025b\u2032 = 27) for application in solid state capacitors . Nb2O5 is one of the useful optical materials for its desirable properties, such as stability in air and water, resistance to acid and base, high refractive index (n = 2.4 at 550 nm), low extinction coefficient and high transparency in the UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR region . It has been widely used in e.g., intelligent windows , solar cells and chemical sensors . Niobium oxide is also a promising material for counter electrode in electrochromic devices, which can be used in case of solar cells, solar energy applications, sensors and display devices . Structure of niobium oxide can exist in different polymorphic forms. There are at least three stable niobium oxides: NbO, NbO2 and Nb2O5 and each has various electrical properties ranging from conducting NbO to semiconducting NbO2 and insulating Nb2O5 . The properties of the niobium oxide thin films depend on the type of deposition process and its parameters, such as reactive gas flow or pressure. It was shown by Ramirez et al. that hardness of thin niobium oxide films increased from 3.9 GPa to 5.3 GPa by increasing the pressure and oxide content. On the other hand Chappe et al. determined the hardness values of niobium oxide films of about 6 GPa and Cetinorgu et al. measured the hardness of amorphous Nb2O5 films deposited by dual ion beam sputtering as a function of the ion energy and the values ranged between 5.5 GPa and 6.5 GPa. In this paper surface properties such as topography, roughness, chemical states of the elements as well as the wettability of Nb2O5 thin films were presented. Additionally, optical and tribological properties of niobium pentoxide were determined and the antireflective layer with protective properties for the purpose of the possible use in the silicon solar cells was proposed.  Thin films were deposited from high purity metallic niobium target in the mixed atmosphere of argon and oxygen by microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering process. Microwave source was used to improve plasma ionisation during the sputtering process. Thin films were deposited on microscope glass, silicon and fused silica substrates. The deposition system was operated with the aid of optical monitoring and crystal quartz controllers. Thickness of deposited coatings was equal to 565 nm. The detailed information about the microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering method was given elsewhere . Structural properties were determined based on the results of the XRD method. For measurements multi-purpose Philips X\u2019Pert powder diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 X-rays, PW 3020 vertical goniometer and PW 3710 MPD control unit employing Bragg\u2013Brentano reflecting geometry parafocusing optics were used. Surface of prepared coatings was examined with the aid of atomic force microscope operating in the contact-mode and in ultra high vacuum conditions. To determine the surface topography properties, the AFM measurements were performed by the UHV VT AFM/STM Omicron atomic force microscope operating in the ultra high vacuum conditions in the contact mode. XPS studies were performed to determine the chemical state of the niobium at the surface of thin films with the aid of Specs Phoibos 100 MCD-5 (5 single channel electron multiplier) hemispherical analyzer using Specs XR-50 X-ray source with Mg K\u03b1 (1253.6 eV) beam. Measurements results were then analyzed with the aid of CasaXPS software. All spectra were calibrated with respect to the binding energy of adventitious C1s peak at 284.8 eV. Contact angle and critical surface tension of the thin films were additionally investigated to examine the surface properties of the prepared coatings. Optical properties of the prepared Nb2O5 thin films were determined based on transmittance and reflectance results obtained from Aquila nkd-8000 spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded for 30\u00b0 angle of incident light, for S and P light polarization. Based on recorded transmittance (T \u03bb) and reflectance (R \u03bb) spectra, refractive index, extinction coefficient characteristics and physical thickness of the films were estimated based on reverse engineering method. Fitting of experimental results for Nb2O5 thin films was made using Drude\u2013Lorentz dispersion model with 5 oscillators and Powell's analysis method. Calculations were performed using Pearson's test\u2013\u03c7 2 (Chi-square) and a fit with negligible deviation between the experimental and calculated data was obtained. Also investigations of the reflection of thin films on silicon substrates were performed using FTG FilmStar software. Calculated refractive index and extinction coefficient were used for the purpose of elaborating a model of antireflective coating for solar cell application. The hardness measurements of the obtained coatings were performed by the nanoindenter manufactured by CSM Instrument equipped with a diamond Vickers indenter. The compound hardness was calculated using the method proposed by Oliver and Pharr . Each data point represents an average of five indentations. A number of measurements have been carried out for various depths of nanoindentation (from 80 nm to 700 nm). In order to measure the \u201cfilm-only\u201d properties and minimize the impact of the substrate a method of nanoindentation measurements approximation has been implemented . Measured hardness of the thin films deposited on substrate can be expressed as a power-low function of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the substrate and the thin film hardness, the depth of nanoindentation and the thickness of thin film : H=HSHfHSM where H s\u2013hardness of substrate, H f\u2013hardness of thin film, M\u2013dimensionless spatial function defined by : M=11+AhdB where A, B\u2013adjustable coefficients, h\u2013maximum intender displacement, d\u2013thickness of thin film. Eq. (1) must fulfil essential boundary conditions: when indentation depth approaches to zero (small indentation displacements) measured hardness tends to thin film hardness, whereas when indentation depth approaches to thin film thickness measured hardness tends to value of substrate hardness. Abrasion resistance of the deposited thin films were investigated using the Summers optical's lens coating hardness test kit. On the basis of experiments the scratch resistance was evaluated. For the purpose of abrasion resistance examination, steel wool test was carried out and consisted of rubbing the surface of Nb2O5 coating with 0 grade steel wool pad using applied load of 0.5 N and 1.0 N. Steel wool pad was pressed to the surface of the coating with selected force and was caused to move across the surface of Nb2O5 thin films for 75 cycles. Surface was examined for scratch resistance by optical microscope and profilometer. In case of Olympus BX51 optical microscope working in the reflected light mode, images of the surface of Nb2O5 thin films were captured. Three-dimensional images of the surface of investigated coatings before and after scratch tests were obtained with the aid of TalySurf CCI Lite Taylor Hobson profilometer. The depth of scratches, as well as the change of roughness, was evaluated.  Nb2O5 thin films deposited by microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering were amorphous since no characteristic peaks were observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1a). Amorphous nature of the deposited thin films can result from low temperature of the sputtering process, which did not exceed 100 \u00b0C. AFM images of investigated Nb2O5 thin films are shown in Fig. 1b,c. The images of the thin film show crack-free surface without visible grains. To analyze the surface properties, the height distribution of grains at the surface has been evaluated and presented in Fig. 1d. The height distribution is symmetric what testifies about homogenous surface, while the calculated RMS surface roughness was found to be equal to 0.34 nm. XPS measurements were performed to determine the chemical states of the niobium at the surface of the prepared Nb2O5 thin films. In Fig. 2a and b, the Nb3d and O1s core level spectra are presented, respectively. The position of the Nb3d doublet and the separation energy width equal to 2.8 eV between the peak of Nb3d5/2 and Nb3d3/2 indicates on the Nb5+ oxidation state, which in result testifies about the formation of Nb2O5 oxides . Results obtained for the O1s oxidation state revealed, that the summarized level of the oxygen related to the adsorbed water molecules (H2Oads) and hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2212) is equal to 55% of the overall oxygen bonds occurring at the surface of investigated thin films. The elemental composition of the surface of the deposited thin films was evaluated based on relative sensitivity factors (R.S.F.) for each of the elements core levels and the area of proper spectra. The R.S.F. were obtained from the CasaXPS software library and were equal to 2.85 and 8.46 for the O1s and Nb3d core levels, respectively. Based on these values the elemental composition of the surface was determined as 65.4 at.% and 34.6 at.% for oxygen and niobium, respectively. Wettability measurement results revealed hydrophobic behavior of thin film surface. Contact angle was equal to 92.8\u00b0, 69.0\u00b0, 55.3\u00b0 for deionized water, ethylene glycol and diiodomethane, respectively. Droplet images of different liquids taken during the measurements are shown in Fig. 2c\u2013e. On the basis of the contact angle investigation, critical surface tension of the Nb2O5 thin films deposited on SiO2 substrates was calculated using Zisman approach . Critical surface tension is often presented as the highest value of surface tension of a liquid which will completely wet solid surface. Results have shown that critical surface tension of the Nb2O5 thin films was equal to 24.8 \u00b1 1.7 mN/m. Contact angle measurements in case of deionized water revealed hydrophobic properties of the Nb2O5 thin film surface. The potential uses of hydrophobicity of the prepared coatings include self-cleaning properties and it might favor influence on long-term performance of the silicon solar cells with applied Nb2O5 coating. The optical properties of investigated thin films were measured by Aquila nkd8000 spectrophotometer, analyzed with the use of Pro-Optix software and the results are shown in Fig. 3a,b. Deposited Nb2O5 coatings are transparent in the measured spectral range from 350 nm to 1000 nm and the average transmission level at \u03bb = 600 nm is equal to about 80%. Spectra measured for S and P polarizations are slightly different due to the measurement, which was performed at 30\u00b0 of light incidence angle. Transmittance and reflectance results were used to calculate the values of refractive index and extinction coefficient. In case of solar cell, it is necessary to reduce its reflection coefficient in such a way, that the total light radiation could be absorbed within the volume of the cell's active material. For the crystalline silicon the reflection coefficient has the value of ca., 35\u201345% in the visible spectral range, therefore its reduction is necessary. One of the ways to minimize this coefficient is to apply antireflective coating, which would be deposited on the front surface of the solar cell. However, the antireflective layer need to fulfil some basic conditions, i.e., it is required to achieve the lowest possible value of the extinction coefficient, which would result in a high value of the transmission coefficient . For example, often used coating as an antireflective layer for silicon solar cells is TiO2, which extinction coefficient is usually about 10\u22123 for the wavelength of 600 nm . This allows on reflection losses reduction from the solar cell to about 2\u20133%. In case of investigated Nb2O5 thin films, the value of extinction coefficient for the \u03bb = 600 nm is equal to 3.59 \u00d7 10\u22125,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "while the refractive index is 2.30. Such value of extinction coefficient shows, that deposited thin films almost do not absorb light in the visible light range. Moreover, due to high transmission coefficient and suitable refractive index, the Nb2O5 coatings could be used as antireflective layers for silicon solar cells. To evaluate optical properties of designed Nb2O5 antireflective layer with specified thickness on silicon substrate, the FTG FilmStar software was used. The reflection coefficient of Si substrate was compared to the Si substrate coated with Nb2O5 thin film with the thickness of 65 nm. It was calculated regarding to the value of refractive index of the coating according to the following equation: narc\u00d7d=\u03bbopt4 where n arc\u2013refractive index of antireflective layer, d\u2013thickness of the antireflective layer, \u03bb opt\u2013length of the wave for which the layer is optimized. The results of these investigations are presented in Fig. 3c and showed, that deposited Nb2O5 thin film reduces the light reflection from ca., 39.2% to ca., 0.9% at the \u03bb = 600 nm. What is worth to emphasize, addition of Nb2O5 layer causes, that the reflection coefficient is lower in the whole investigated spectral range from 400 nm to 1000 nm. In case of solar cell, the crucial factor is also the angle at which the light incidence its surface. The investigation results of reflection coefficient in the function of the light incidence angle is presented in Fig. 3d. The reflection coefficient of uncoated silicon substrate is stable up to 75\u00b0 and equal to ca., 39%, while deposition of Nb2O5 thin film reduces the light reflection beneath 10% up to 60\u00b0 of the light incidence angle. Hardness of the prepared niobium pentoxide thin films, which has been measured by nanoindentation and determined by approximation method, was equal to 6.7 GPa (Fig. 4a), 6.9 GPa (Fig. 4b) and 6.8 GPa for silicon dioxide, microscope glass and silicon substrates, respectively. The hardness of each substrate was also investigated and equal to 11.5 GPa, 10.0 GPa and 8.0 GPa for silicon, silica and microscope slides, respectively. As compared to the results presented in the literature reports, hardness of investigated Nb2O5 thin films is higher of ca., 22% \u2013 75% , 13% and ca., 5% \u2013 24% . Tribological properties of prepared Nb2O5 thin films were determined using steel wool test with selected applied load of 0.5 N and 1.0 N. In case of optical microscopy images only single scratches were observed at the thin film surface and they did not influence on optical properties of prepared coatings. It was also observed, that increased load up to 1.0 N resulted in more visible single scratches, than in case of 0.5 N load. The depth of scratches was evaluated with the aid of Taylor Hobson profilometer and the results of these investigations are shown in Fig. 5a\u2013c. As well as in case of optical microscope measurements, during the profilometry investigation only few scratches were found. The cross-section topography of Nb2O5 thin films after scratch tests with different loads is presented in Fig. 5d. The scratches of the thin film after the test with 0.5 N load were shallow and equal to ca., 5 nm. However, increase of the load during the scratch test to 1.0 N changed the depth of scratches up to ca., 10\u201312 nm. The mean arithmetical surface height measured with the aid of optical profilometer changed from 0.72 nm for as-deposited sample to 1.03 nm and 1.24 after performing scratch tests with loads of 0.5 N and 1.0 N, respectively. The depth of scratches was equal only to several nanometers and the roughness did not change significantly. Therefore, the prepared Nb2O5 thin films may be considered as scratch resistant coatings. In case of deposition of Nb2O5 coatings on the silicon solar cells the scratch resistant properties would be beneficial in case of the long-term performance of the cell. Coating of precisely specified thickness would not only be the antireflective layer, but will also prevent from the deterioration of the surface of the solar cell by various environmental hazards.  Niobium oxide thin films deposited by microwave assisted reactive magnetron sputtering process exhibit several interesting properties. Prepared coatings were amorphous and their surface was homogenous with very low RMS roughness of ca., 0.34 nm. XPS studies revealed that the thin film surface was composed from Nb2O5 oxides, while wettability measurements showed its hydrophobic behavior. Based on optical investigations result it was shown, that prepared coatings are transparent in the spectral range from 350 nm to 1000 nm. Nb2O5 thin films have low extinction coefficient value and proper refractive index in case of application as antireflective layer for the purpose of silicon solar cells. Studies showed that the reflection coefficient of silicon is strongly reduced from ca., 39% to ca., 0.9% at \u03bb = 600 nm after the deposition of Nb2O5 coating with precisely selected thickness. Deposited thin films also exhibit good mechanical properties. Hardness of Nb2O5 thin films was ca., 7 GPa, what is even 75% higher value as compared to the literature data. Investigated coatings are also scratch resistant, what was confirmed by the measurements performed after wool steel scratch tests. Presented results show that the prepared Nb2O5 thin films could be used as antireflective layers for the purpose of application in silicon solar cells. Additional features, such as hydrophobicity and scratch resistance could favourably influence on the long-term performance of silicon solar cells due to self-cleaning and protective properties of the Nb2O5 coatings.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Since Fujishima and Honda demonstrated to produce the hydrogen using PEC water splitting in 1972 , numerous active semiconductor materials (such as TiO2 and ZnO etc.) have been proven to be able to serve as the photoelectrodes of PEC system . In spite of TiO2 is the most commonly studied in photoelectrode of PEC system, ZnO has been considered as an ideal replacement to TiO2 owing to its similar energy band structure and higher photogenerated electron transfer rate . What is more, ZnO can be simply synthesized to various morphology, such as nanotube, nanowire and nanotree etc. . Among the variety of nanostructures, one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructure (such as nanotube and nanowire etc.) can provide a direct electrical pathway without crystal boundary resistance . Therefore, it is important to adopt 1D ZnO NT arrays as photoelectrode of PEC system due to its high specific surface area and photoelectrons transport properties . So far, various methods for synthesizing core/shell tubular ZnO-based nanoarrays have been employed, such as electrochemical method , wet chemical method , hydrothermal method and template-based growth . Nevertheless, it is a grand challenge to synthesis large-scale growth of ZnO-based NT arrays with uniform morphology and structure. A novel technique to overcome these disadvantages for large-scale fabrication of well-aligned ZnO-based NT arrays is to apply a simple process based on directional chemical etching. However, bare ZnO photoelectrode can respond only to ultraviolet (UV) region due to its wide band gap, which just accounts for 4% of the sunlight . In order to extend the absorption spectrum to the visible light region, numerous efforts have been done (such as elemental doping and sensitizing with the quantum dots) . Sensitizing with the quantum dots (QDs) has been identified as an effective route for PEC system due to the outstanding photoelectrical properties of QDs sensitizers and its similarities with dye-sensitized photoelectrode . Among the various QDs sensitizers, CdS, PbS etc. demonstrate high photocatalytic activity in PEC system, but their toxicity threats our health and environment seriously. Ternary Zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4), which has a suitable band gap (2.34\u20132.48 eV) according with the visible light region and ideal chemical stability for PEC water splitting, has attracted considerable attention . For ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO PEC electrode, ZnIn2S4 offers favorable energetic for photoelectric since its conduction band edge is more negative than ZnO . To our best knowledge, although ZnIn2S4 has showed high photocatalytic activity, there are few reports about the PEC electrode of ZnIn2S4 served as sensitizer in water splitting. Moreover, it is known that, in a core/shell nanostructure, the introduction of a buffer layer between core and shell can enhance the device performance owing to (a) the buffer layer optimizes the band configuration of the structure; (b) it increases excess carrier lifetime; (c) it improves lattice matching at the heterojunction interface . Lee et al. reported a synthetic route to a CuInS2/CdS/ZnO NR structure for a thin film solar cell with a buffer of CdS . Motivated by the above concerns, herein, we firstly fabricated the ZnIn2S4 sensitized 1D ZnO nanoarrays with a buffer layer of ZnS via a simple chemical conversion method and a convenience directional chemical etching process. Compared with the traditional methods, the chemical route is easy to be controlled and obtained uniform structure, which can decrease defects of the products . In the present study, the effects of reaction time and solution concentration on the core/shell structure and PEC activity of photoelectorde were investigated. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of NT by chemical etching process was discussed in detail according to the experimental results. Finally, ZnO NT arrays with a buffer of ZnS and sensitized by ZnIn2S4 QDs were fabricated to apply in PEC system, the calculated efficiency for hydrogen production of the samples was evaluated to be up to 8.86%. It is founded that the excellent performance is attributed to the enhanced absorption efficiency and appropriate gradient energy gap structure. These results provide new insight in the development of ternary sensitizer QDs sensitized ZnO-based photoelectode for PEC water splitting.  The ZnO NR arrays were directly grown on the indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates . In a typical synthesis process, firstly, the ITO substrates were ultrasonically rinsed for 0.5 h in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and ethanol absolution, respectively. The seed layer was deposited on ITO via a sol\u2013gel and dip-coating method. Then the substrates with seed layer were annealed at 400 \u00b0C for 60 min, followed by the incubation in the aqueous solution containing 0.05 M zinc nitrate and 0.05 M hexamethylenetetramine at 90 \u00b0C for 4 h. The prepared samples of ZnO NR films were washed with deionized water and dried in air. The ZnO/ZnS NR arrays were prepared via a chemical conversion process by immersing the ZnO NR arrays in aqueous solutions containing 0.02 M thiacetamide (TAA) at 90 \u00b0C for 7 h. Meanwhile, the ZnO/ZnS NT films of different reaction time were synthesized via a directional chemical etching by immersing the ZnO NR arrays in aqueous solutions containing 0.1 M TAA at 90 \u00b0C for 1 h, 5 h and 7 h, respectively. The as-obtained samples were washed with deionized water and dried in air. In a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, samples of ZnO/ZnS NR and NT arrays were immersed in triethylene glycol (TEG) containing 5 mM InCl3, respectively. The samples of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays were prepared when the auto-clave was sealed and maintained at 200 \u00b0C for 3 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the products were washed with absolute ethanol and dried in air. Meanwhile, samples of ZnO/ZnS NT arrays were immersed in TEG containing 10 mM InCl3, and the auto-clave was sealed and maintained at 200 \u00b0C for 5 h, then the ZnO/ZnIn2S4. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "NT arrays were obtained. The as-prepared products were washed with absolute alcohol and dried in air. Morphology and structure of the samples were characterized using HITACHI S-4800I field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The EDS mapping of the samples analysis were also performed during the FE-SEM observation. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were performed using a Rigaku D/max-2500 using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.154059 nm). DU-8B UV/VIS double-beam spectrophotometer was used to achieve the optical absorption spectra of the photoelectrode. PEC properties characterization of the products were determined using an electrochemical workstation (LK2005A, Tianjin, China), a three-electrode configuration, with ZnO-based nanoarrays on ITO as the working photoelectrode, 1 M Na2S solution as electrolyte, saturated Ag/AgCl as reference electrode, and a platinum (Pt) foil as counter electrode. Meanwhile, photocurrents of the samples were measured under the irradiation of a xenon lamp (100 mW cm\u22122) with global AM 1.5 G. The hydrogen generation efficiencies (\u03b7) of the photoelectrodes were calculated by the following equation : \u03b7=I(1.23\u2212Ebias)Jlight\u00d7100% where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm\u22122), 1.23 the theoretical potential required for water splitting, E bias the applied external potential and J light the intensity of the simulated incident solar light, which is 100 mW cm\u22122 in this study. To estimate the correlation between light absorption and photocurrent density on diverse PEC electrodes, incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed under a constant potential of 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl. IPCE values were calculated using the following equation : IPCE=1240Jp\u03bbIlight\u00d7100% where J p is the photocurrent density (mA cm\u22122), I light is the incident light irradiance (100 mW cm\u22122), and \u03bb is the incident light wavelength (nm).  In this work, 1D ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO nanoarrays (including NT and NR) were successfully fabricated through a facile hydrothermal chemical method. The effect of preparation parameters on the structure of the product was studied by adjusting the pH value of solution, the concentration of the TAA solution (or InCl3 solution) and the reaction time. The synthetic route of ZnIn2S4 sensitized 1D ZnO nanoarrays is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . The hexagonal ZnO NR arrays were initially prepared on ITO substrates via a hydrothermal method (Step 1). In this step, the ZnO seed layer was fabricated after sintering and developed into ZnO NRs in the growth solution. It is well known that chemical conversion process based on the ion-by-ion growth mechanism would take place spontaneously when there are sufficient differences in the solubility products constants (K sp) between the reactants and the products. When the ITO substrate coated with ZnO NR arrays is immersed into 0.02 M TAA solution, the sulfidation of ZnO will take place producing TAA hydrolyzes and H2S gas (the chemical reactions happened are as Eq. (3)) , it is because of the large difference between the solubility product constants (K sp) of ZnO (6.8 \u00d7 10\u221217) and ZnS (2.93 \u00d7 10\u221225). CH3CSNH2 + H2O \u2192 CH3CONH2 + H2S The further reaction of ZnO with H2S around the surface of the NRs leads to the formation of ZnO/ZnS core/shell NRs (Step 1-1) (Fig. 2 (a)). Nevertheless, when the sample is immersed into 0.1 M TAA solution, the ZnO NRs will convert to ZnO/ZnS NTs (Step 2-1) (Fig. 2(d)), and the synthetic route of ZnO/ZnS NT arrays was showed in Fig. 2(e), which is attributed to the TAA solution in high concentration can produce more hydrogen ion, and thus the pH was reduced significantly. As an amphoteric oxide, ZnO NRs can react with H+ in TAA solution and the products are soluble salts (Eq. (5)), with the increase of H+ concentration, the chemical etching process on ZnO NRs was gradually enhanced. According to our experimental results, ZnO/ZnS NRs are formed by chemical etching on the outside surface of NRs in 0.02 M TAA solution (Fig. 2(a)), ZnO/ZnS NTs are formed by selective etching on the (0 0 1) polar planes of NRs in 0.1 M TAA solution (Fig. 2(d)). The chemical reactions and the thermodynamic deduction of reactions happened are as following : \u0394G=G(product)\u2212G(reactant) \u0394G=\u0394H\u2212T\u0394S H2S\u21922H++S2\u2212 \u0394G = 119.36 kJ mol\u22121; \u0394H = 53.73 kJ mol\u22121; \u0394S = \u2212220.39 J mol\u22121; T = 298 K; ZnO+S2\u2212+H2O\u2192ZnS+2OH\u2212 \u0394G = \u221246.15 kJ mol\u22121; ZnO+2H+\u2192Zn2++H2O \u0394G = \u221265.89 kJ mol\u22121; It is known that the chemical reactions occur spontaneously when \u0394G < 0, which means that the chemical reaction of Eqs. (7) and (8) will occurred. It can be seen that the \u0394G of Eq. (6) was higher than zero, however, the temperature of chemical reactions occur spontaneously is 298 K. In our experiment, the temperature of solution is 363 K, therefore, the reactions listed above can proceed naturally. It can be concluded that the concentration of TAA solution plays an important role in the formation of ZnO/ZnS nanoarrays during the hydrothermal chemical progress. And the structure (NR or NT) can be controlled by altering the concentration of the TAA solution. The preparation of ternary chalcogenides (ZnIn2S4) is operated in an auto-clave. Finally, ZnIn2S4 shell was obtained after ZnS reacting with enough In3+ in the triethylene glycol (TEG) solvent. When the ITO substrate with ZnO/ZnS NRs (NTs) was immersed in 5 mM InCl3 solution for 3 h, ZnS shell was partially converted to ZnIn2S4. In this step, the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NRs (NTs) could be obtained by using ZnO/ZnS NRs (NTs) as reactive templates, a buffer layer of ZnS and a ternary sensitizer layer of ZnIn2S4 were formed at the same time. In order to investigate the forming process of ZnO/ZnS NTs, ZnO NRs were etched in different concentrations of solution and at different reaction time. Fig. 2(a) shows the TEM image of ZnO NRs in 0.02 M TAA solution for 7 h, Fig. 2(b\u2013d) shows the TEM images of ZnO NRs in 0.1 M TAA solution at different periods. Fig. 2(a) presents a typical TEM image of ZnO/ZnS NR obtained by immersing the ZnO NRs in 0.02 M TAA solution for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "7 h, the result reveals that the ZnO NR is fully covered with a ZnS shell, the diameter of NRs is about 130 nm. As displayed in Fig. 2(b), a slender hollow structure was formed in the center part of the product after being etched in TAA solution for 1 h. When the etching time increased to 5 h (Fig. 2(c)), the hollow structure is bigger, the diameter of hollow structure is about 50 nm. When etching time was reached to 7 h (Fig. 2(d)), ZnO/ZnS NTs with thin-wall were obtained. In brief, the diameter of hollow structure increased gradually with increasing etching time. It can be seen clearly from the above experimental results (Fig. 2(a\u2013d)), the ZnO/ZnS NRs (NTs) with arbitrary thickness can be synthesized by adjusting the etching time in TAA solution (adjusting the concentration of TAA solution). The ZnO/ZnS nanotubes could be obtained in the low pH when the concentration of TAA solution is 0.1 M. On the contrary, the ZnO/ZnS nanorods could be formed under low concentration of TAA solution (0.2 M). On the basis of the TEM images of ZnO NRs in TAA solution at different periods, the formation route of the ZnO/ZnS NT arrays can be proposed as a directional chemical etching mechanism, which is illustrated in Fig. 2(e). In this chemical etching process, the ZnO NRs can be transformed into ZnO/ZnS NTs after treatment in acidic solutions. In aqueous TAA solution, ZnO NRs can react with H+ in acid solution and the products are soluble salts. Therefore, the chemical etching process will occur when the ZnO NRs were immersed in TAA solution. It is generally known that the etching process is directional and mainly focused on the center of NRs, which is attributed to the metastability of the (0 0 1) plane with high surface energy . As a result, the etching rate of (0 0 1) polar plane is faster than that of nonpolar plane, the directional etching of ZnO along the c-axis causes the formation of the NT arrays. With the etching time increasing, the depth of the NT gradually increased. In this work, chemical etching process starts from the top surface of NR, and then the chemical etching process mainly focused on the inner of NR. Eventually, the NTs were covered up because of many ZnS nanoparticles accumulated on the pipe orifice. To further analyze the correlation between the properties of PEC electrode and the NRs (NT) structure, PEC performance of ZnO-based nanoarrays photoelectrodes was performed using an electrochemical workstation. Fig. 3 (A) shows the photocurrent density\u2013voltage curves under the irradiation of AM 1.5 G and dark condition of as-prepared 1 h ZnO/ZnS NTs, 5 h ZnO/ZnS NTs, ZnO/ZnS NRs and 7 h ZnO/ZnS NTs, respectively. It can be seen that the current of samples under dark condition was very low, therefore, the majority of measured current is photocurrent. Furthermore, Table 1 displays the photocurrent density and efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-obtained samples. It can be seen that the photocurrent densities of 1 h ZnO/ZnS NT, 5 h ZnO/ZnS NT, ZnO/ZnS NR and 7 h ZnO/ZnS NT were 0.47 mA cm\u22122 at 0.278 V versus Ag/AgCl, 1.06 mA cm\u22122 at 0.288 V versus Ag/AgCl, 2.10 mA cm\u22122 at 0.312 V versus Ag/AgCl, 2.21 mA cm\u22122 at 0.338 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively, measured in Na2S electrolyte (1 mol/L) under irradiation with simulated light of AM 1.5 G. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 3(C), the theoretical efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-prepared 1 h ZnO/ZnS NT, 5 h ZnO/ZnS NT, ZnO/ZnS NR and 7 h ZnO/ZnS NT were 0.45%, 1.00%, 1.93% and 1.97%, respectively. The maximum efficiency of hydrogen production of 1.97% was calculated, indicating that the shell thickness was a key factor for PEC performance. To understand the interrelation between reaction parameters and nanostructure (such as buffer layer, hollow structure), various samples (ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT) were synthesized by adjusting the concentration of InCl3 and the reaction time. Furthermore, these structures were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 4 (a and b) shows the TEM images and the HRTEM images of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, respectively. It can be seen that the sample is a trilaminar core/shell NR with a diameter of about 130 nm, the surface of NR appears to be relatively smooth, and some nanoparticles are accumulated on the surface. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the HRTEM image clearly presents three distinct sets of lattice fringes, where the crystal lattice fringes spacing are 0.26 nm, 0.25 nm and 0.193 nm, corresponding to the ZnO, ZnS and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Fig. 4(c and d) shows the TEM and HRTEM images of ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively, where the bistratal core/shell nanostructure can be clearly observed. The diameter of NT is about 130 nm, and the ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles are uniformly covered around the NT surface. From the HRTEM image in Fig. 4(d), two distinct sets of lattice fringes are corresponding to the ZnO and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Fig. 4(e and f) shows the TEM and HRTEM images of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively. The sample is a trilaminar NT with a diameter of about 130 nm, and the buffer layer of ZnS can be clearly observed. The HRTEM investigation (Fig. 4(f)) reveals the trilaminar NT is composed of ZnO, ZnS and ZnIn2S4. From the above observations and analyses of TEM and HRTEM, as we expected, bistratal and trilaminar ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO core/shell nanoarrays (NR and NT) were synthesized successfully. In order to further investigate the correlation between the PEC performance of electrode and the nanostructure (such as buffer layer, hollow structure) more explicitly, ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO nanoarrays photoelectrodes were fabricated to determine the PEC properties. Fig. 5 (A) shows the photocurrent density\u2013voltage curves under the irradiation of AM 1.5 G and dark condition of as-obtained ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR and ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively. The current of samples in dark condition was very low, so we can concluded that the majority of measured current is photocurrent. What is. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "more, the photocurrent density and hydrogen generation efficiencies of products were presented in Table 1. The photocurrent densities of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 5.72 mA cm\u22122 at 0.038 V versus Ag/AgCl, 4.20 mA cm\u22122 at 0.156 V versus Ag/AgCl, 7.44 mA cm\u22122 at 0.039 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. Correspondingly, as shown in Fig. 5(B), the theoretical efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-prepared ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 6.82%, 4.51% and 8.86%, respectively. Fig. 5(C) presents the IPCE plots of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, it can be seen that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT photoelectrode exhibited highest photoactivity in visible light. Besides, IPCE profile of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT PEC electrodes is found broadened and strengthened over the entire wavelength region compared with that of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NR, ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NT PEC electrodes. Based on the above analyses, ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT PEC electrode showed the highest hydrogen generation efficiency, revealing that ZnS buffer layer and hollow NT structure were more suitable for absorb photons and separate electrons and holes. It is well known that buffering techniques can inhibit the formation of interface traps and defect states, prolong the excess carrier lifetime. In such an energy gap configuration (Fig. 6 ), a buffer layer of ZnS between ZnO and ZnIn2S4 can enhance the device performance by avoiding undesirable shunt path and widening the depletion width that extend electricfield in absorber layer and minimize the collection loss by tunneling and recombination. As a consequence, the gradient energy gap structure can improved the separation and transmission of photogenerated electrons and holes significantly. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared sample were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Fig. 7 (a) shows a SEM image of the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays, and the inset shows a enlarge view of the NT arrays. It can be seen clearly that the high-density NTs grow vertically aligned on the ITO substrate, and the NT presents a hexagonal shape with diameter ranging from 120 nm to 140 nm. Analysis of SEM images presents that some nanoparticles accumulated on the top of the NTs (inset of Fig. 7(a)), and thus the NTs is covered up. As depicted in Fig. 7(b), the TEM image reveals the product is a trilaminar nanotube, in which ZnO is the hollow core, ZnIn2S4 is the shell and ZnS as buffer layer between the core and shell. The surface of NTs is smooth and a lot of ZnIn2S4 quantum dots (QDs) distribute uniformly over the NT surface. And the diameter of NT is consistent with the SEM observations. The element composition of as-prepared ZnO/ZnS and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 were further characterized using energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping, the EDS mapping of samples are shown in Fig. 8 . EDS results of ZnO/ZnS and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 shows that elements of Zn, O, S and In can be clearly observed. It provides credible evidence for the composition of the samples includes ZnIn2S4. The composition and crystallographic structure of the ZnO NRs, ZnO/ZnS NTs and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs were determined by X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. 9 (a\u2013c). In Fig. 9(a), the ZnO NR presents hexagonal structure according to the standard ZnO diffraction pattern (JCPDS, No. 36-1451). Furthermore, ZnO NR preferentially grew along the [0 0 2] direction, implying that the arrays grew on the ITO substrate vertically. Fig. 9(b) shows the XRD patterns of ZnO/ZnS NT arrays, it can be seen that new peak appeared, which is in agreement with the ZnS (JCPDS, No. 12-0688), indicating that the ZnO NR arrays have been converted to ZnO/ZnS core/shell arrays already. The composition and crystallographic structure of the as-prepared ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs were determined by X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. 9(c), the new peaks can be well indexed to a hexagonal phase of ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS, No. 49-1562). All peaks of ZnO, ZnS and ZnIn2S4 were appeared in Fig. 9(c), which indicates that the only partial conversion of ZnS layer to ZnIn2S4, and further support that the EDS mapping results. Combined with Fig. 9(a and b), these diffraction results suggested that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays can be easily prepared under the current synthetic conditions. The optical properties of ZnO NRs, ZnO/ZnS NTs and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs were characterized by the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 10 (a). It can be seen that ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs exhibit a remarkable red-shift compared to the ZnO NRs, and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs achieve the best efficiency of visible light absorption. Corresponding band gap of the samples are shown in inset of Fig. 10(a), the approximate band gap value of ZnO NRs, ZnO/ZnS NTs and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs are determined to be \u223c3.0 eV, \u223c2.20 eV and \u223c1.76 eV, demonstrating that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NTs is suitable for the visible light absorption. It should be noted that the ZnIn2S4 sensitizer could improve the photo response spectrum due to the appropriate energy band gap structure (Fig. 6) and the high optical absorption coefficient of ZnIn2S4. Taking into consideration the efficient utilize of visible light in a majority of the solar spectrum, this ZnIn2S4 sensitized ZnO NT arrays based PEC electrode is an attractive semiconductor materials for water splitting. Fig. 10(b) displays the photocurrent density of ZnO NR, ZnO/ZnS NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT, respectively. It can be seen that the photocurrent densities of ZnO NR, ZnO/ZnS NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 0.41 mA cm\u22122 at 0.212 V versus Ag/AgCl, 2.21 mA cm\u22122 at 0.338 V versus Ag/AgCl, 7.44 mA cm\u22122 at 0.04 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively, where the samples are used as photoelectrodes and Na2S (1 mol/L) as electrolyte. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 10(c), the theoretical efficiencies of hydrogen generation of as-prepared ZnO NR, ZnO/ZnS NT and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT were 0.42%, 1.97% and 8.86%, respectively. The highest theoretical efficiency of sample showed a remarkable increment compared with the ZnO NR and the ZnO/ZnS NT. It can be concluded that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays is an effective nanostructure for water splitting. Furthermore, in order to investigate the stability of as-prepared PEC electrodes, linear sweep voltammograms. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "is measured after C-V scanning for 1 and 15 cycles under illumination, using ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays as typical photoelectrodes. Fig. 10(d) illustrates the photocurrent density of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 1st and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 15th, respectively. The photocurrent densities of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 1st and ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 cycle 15th were 7.70 mA cm\u22122 at 0.138 V and 7.56 mA cm\u22122 at 0.155 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. It is found obviously that the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 arrays PEC electrode shows much more stable current density after C-V scanning under illumination for 15 cycles, revealing a better capability to resist photocorrosion. The efficient utilization of incident sun light, the carrier injection and collection are two key factors contributing to the PEC water splitting. For the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 NT arrays, a high efficiency of light-harvesting can be achieved by fabricating well-aligned NT arrays with high surface served as the PEC electrode, as well as, carrier injection and collection can be improved by constructing gradient energy gap configuration. The lights transfer process was shown in Fig. 11 , ZnIn2S4 nanoparticles around the NT surface can reflect unabsorbed lights back to the NT arrays and the space between the nanoparticles, and thus the efficiency of light utilization is improved, which is in favor of utilization of incident sun light. Meanwhile, as a high light absorption coefficient in the visible regions materials, a layer of ZnIn2S4 can trap relatively more photons, thereby, more photons would be utilized by NT arrays for generating electron/hole pairs. Furthermore, vertical ZnO arrays on the ITO substrate can directly transport the photo-generated electrons with a high speed, which is beneficial to the carrier transport properties of the NT arrays. The appropriate matching of the gradient energy gap structures of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 is a key factor in the PEC water splitting process because of it can significantly increase the efficiency of carrier injection and collection. The energy gap structures of ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 and ZnO/ZnIn2S4 heterostructure are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. As we can see from Fig. 6, both the conduction band minimum and the valance band maximum of ZnO are lower than that of ZnIn2S4. As a result, the ZnO/ZnIn2S4 composite can lead to not only transfer of electron from the conduction band of ZnIn2S4 to that of ZnO, but also transfer of hole from the valence band of ZnO to that of ZnIn2S4, and thus the efficiency of separation and transmission of electron and hole was dramatically enhanced. Based on the band gaps and the relative positions of semiconductor nanomaterials, an appropriate gradient energy gap structure was formed. It can be concluded that an excellent PEC cell was achieved by combining ZnO/ZnIn2S4 NTs with a ZnS buffer layer.  In summary, well aligned ZnIn2S4 sensitized 1D ZnO nanoarrays (NR and NT) have been fabricated on the ITO substrate via a facile and effective chemical method using ZnO nanorod as templates. Two different methods, hydrothermal chemical conversion and directional chemical etching, were used to synthesize ZnO-based core/shell nanorods arrays and ZnO-based core/shell nanotubes arrays, respectively. The formation of the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 nanostructure (NR or NT) was associated with the solution concentration and the reaction time. By adjusting the amount of reactants and reaction time, the core/shell nanostructure can be tuned from NR to NT and formed buffer layer. The calculated efficiency of hydrogen production for ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 PEC electrode were up to 8.86%, the performance of the ZnO/ZnS/ZnIn2S4 PEC electrode was remarkably enhanced compared with the pure ZnO photoelectrode, which resulted from the broaden absorption spectrum and improved separation ability of the photogenerated electron and hole. This study demonstrates an excellent potential in the design and preparation of ZnO-based photoelectrode for PEC water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2020.145989.txt", "paper": ["Recently, carbon nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention in various scientific and technical fields because of their extraordinary properties including high thermal conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, and optional semiconducting/metallic nature [1\u20134]. In particular, carbon nanomaterials have been used as semiconductors and/or electrodes in various electronic devices (e.g., transistors, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and sensors) and have shown to exhibit electrical performances that are comparable to or surpass those of conventional inorganic ones such as Si and oxide semiconductors [5\u201310]. Moreover, their mechanical strength and applicability to various types of processing methods can lead to innovative enhancements in printable, flexible, and wearable electronics [11\u201313]. Therefore, they are regarded as excellent competitive candidates for solution-processable materials for next-generation printed electronics. To assemble carbon nanomaterials for application to various types of electronic devices, patterning is a significant manufacturing step. In general, the patterning methods of carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube (CNTs) and graphene are similar to those of conventional Si-based electronics, wherein the material requires complex lithography and subsequent reactive-ion etching processes with oxygen plasma [14\u201316]. However, these complicated patterning processes are vulnerable to contamination of the surfaces because of the use of toxic chemicals, and the additional etching process is expensive and time-consuming [16,17]. Alternatively, wettability patterning using the significant differences in surface energies has been considered a good way to simply and effectively control the patterns of coated materials via solution routes. This difference between the wetting/dewetting parts provides high resolution patterns of various materials, allowing the fabrication of highly ordered organic semiconductors [18\u201321] and electrodes [6,22]. However, this type of method usually requires complicated pretreatment steps to obtain the differences in wettability, i.e., sequential processes of surface modification and lithography [6,19]. In addition, the materials used to obtain these differences in wettability might be required to be removed [19,23]. To simplify process steps of device fabrication, a clever design of materials that do not need to be removed will help achieve non-lithographic and etch-free wettability patterning. The existence of these materials can also contribute to an improvement in electrical performance of the resulting devices. The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing technique has received enormous attention because of its potential for obtaining high resolution patterns as it provides well-controlled droplets using the electric field between the nozzle and substrates [24\u201329]. Various jetting modes of the EHD printing enable to allow direct patterning of many materials, including silver nanowire, 6, 13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-PEN), poly(3-hexylthiophene), and poly(methyl methacrylate) [27,29\u201331]. Therefore, this technique can directly print the materials used to prepare wettability patterns, achieving high resolution patterns of carbon nanomaterials via a non-lithographic and etch-free process. Here, we report a new approach to fabricate sub-micrometer scale CNTs and CNT/graphene composite patterns using EHD printing and wettability patterning techniques and utilize these patterns as source and drain (S/D) electrodes for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Differences in wettability were successfully obtained by directly drawing 6-\u00b5m wide dimethylchlorosilane-terminated polystyrene (PS-brush) strand-like films so that this printed PS-brush induced the dewetting of the carbon nanomaterial solution. Furthermore, the PS-brush treatment effectively modified the surface hydrophobicity of the substrates, serving as a PS-brush and SiO2 bilayer dielectric to guarantee high stability during the OFET operation [30,32]. This approach achieved both patterning of S/D electrodes and surface modification of dielectrics using only one step without photolithography and etching, which is in contrast to previous methods of patterning conductive polymers, silver nanowires, and CNT by wettability differences [33\u201335]. We also found that solution-processed organic semiconductors were more suitable for our system than organic semiconductors based on the vacuum process, as demonstrated by morphological analyzation. Therefore, we believe our designed patterning method for carbon nanomaterial can assist in the future development of carbon nanomaterials and in the printing industry and in the application of carbon nanomaterials in commercial devices.  Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (diameter: 10\u201320\u00a0nm, length: 5\u201320\u00a0mm) were purchased from Nanolab (Newton MA, US). Water-dispersible graphene paste was purchased from MExplorer. PS-brush (molecular weight\u00a0=\u00a08000, polydispersity index\u00a0=\u00a01.06) was purchased from Polymer Source. Absolute ethanol (99.5%) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Toluene, pentacene, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) solution (PSS, 18\u00a0wt% in H2O), 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene (Tetralin), polystyrene (PS, molecular weight\u00a0=\u00a0125,000), and TIPS-PEN with purity greater than 99% were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All materials were used as received without further purification. Highly doped n-type Si wafers (resistivity\u00a0<\u00a00.005\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm) with a 100-nm thermally grown SiO2 gate dielectric layer were used as the substrates for the OFETs. The Si wafers were cleaned with boiled acetone for 15\u00a0min. Then, the clipped Si wafers were sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 30\u00a0min, dried under a nitrogen stream, and further cleaned with UV-ozone exposure for 15\u00a0min. The wettability patterns were produced by directly drawing PS-brush via the EHD printing technique. In detail, PS-brush ink was prepared using toluene at a concentration of 2\u00a0wt%. This ink was taken in a glass syringe with a nozzle diameter of 200\u00a0\u03bcm and was loaded in the EHD-jet printing machine (Enjet, Korea). The flow rate and working distance in this study were optimized to 0.2\u00a0\u03bcL/min and 180\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. The power supply applied the electric field between the nozzle and the substrate, which served as the ground. EHD printing was performed in micro-dripping mode with DC 1.15\u00a0kV and at various printing speeds between 0.5 and 15\u00a0mm/s under ambient air conditions. After EHD printing, the substrates were annealed at 110 \u00b0C for 60\u00a0min and then rinsed with toluene to remove the un-grafted and un-reacted residual PS-brush. The solution of CNTs was prepared using PSS and ethanol following methods reported elsewhere [28,36]. In a similar manner, the CNT/graphene composite solution was synthesized at a weight ratio 3:7. Then, spin casting was performed to fabricate the carbon electrode pattern. A 50\u00a0nm-thick pentacene active layer was deposited onto the patterned samples by organic molecular beam deposition at a deposition rate of 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0\u00c5/s under a vacuum pressure of 10\u22126\u00a0Torr and substrate temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Another active layer was deposited by TIPS-PEN:PS blend solution prepared at a 1:1\u00a0wt ratio in tetralin with a concentration of 4\u00a0wt% through spin casting. The meniscus formed during the micro-dripping. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "mode printing was monitored using the CCD camera of EHD printing machine. The morphologies of the patterned electrodes were analyzed using an optical microscope (OM, Nikon ECLIPSE LV100ND), atomic force microscope (AFM, VEECO Dimension 3100\u00a0+\u00a0AFM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800). The morphologies of the active layers were analyzed with AFM and 2-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) measurements taken at the 3C beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in the Republic of Korea. The surface potential, energy level of electrodes, and morphological alignment of the organic semiconductor were measured using UV photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the 4D beamline at the PAL. Electrical characteristics of the OFETs were measured using a Keithley 4200 SCS at room temperature under vacuum (~10\u22123 torr) and in a dark state to exclude the effects of H2O, O2, and visible light on the electrical performance of the OFETs.  Fig. 1 a shows a schematic illustration of the overall process of preparing the PS-brush surface modifying layer patterns and carbon nanomaterial electrodes. First, reactive oxygen radicals generated by UV-ozonation generate hydroxyl groups that can react with chlorosilane groups on the substrate surface (Fig. S1) [37]. Then, to fabricate the dewetting patterns, EHD printing was employed to apply hydrophobic modification on the surface with the PS-brush. Then, the surface of the substrate modified by the PS-brush was converted to a hydrophobic surface, as shown in Fig. S1. Next, the solution of carbon nanomaterials (CNTs or CNT/graphene composite) was coated by spin casting, during which significant differences in the wettability between the PS-brush treated surface and the other regions produced patterns of carbon nanomaterial electrodes. EHD printing was used to fabricate the wettability patterns. This printing process is a type of electrospinning method with a short nozzle-to-substrate distance of approximately hundreds of micrometers [38]. The jetting behavior of EHD printing was decided by the deformation of the ink meniscus on the nozzle tip according to the balance with the surface tension or viscous action of the loaded ink and electric field [36,39]. Fig. 1b shows a schematic diagram of the EHD printing process and the OM image at the edge of the nozzle tip of the EHD printer during micro-dripping mode printing. The injected solution formed a bulge at the tip of the nozzle because of gravity and surface tension. Then, if the applied electric field is increased to some extent, the field induces a tangential stress on the liquid surface, which elongates the meniscus on the nozzle tip forming an ellipsoidal shape and deforming to micro-drops, as described in Fig. 1b [26\u201329]. This series of processes can be explained by Rayleigh\u2019s theory based on the balance between the repulsive electrostatic force and the surface tension of the liquid restoring forces as follows [40]. qmax=\u03c0(8\u03b50\u03b3dd3)0.5 where qmax is the maximum charge of the droplet, dd is the diameter of the droplet (m), \u03b50 is the surrounding gas permittivity (C/(V\u2219m)), and \u03b3 is the surface tension of the liquid (N/m). Under our conditions, the micro-dripping mode with 2\u00a0wt% PS-brush in Toluene was operated at a working distance of 180\u00a0\u03bcm, and an electric field of 1.15\u00a0kV applied. The PS-brush chemically reacted with the surface of the SiO2 dielectric, thereby forming a monolayer (sub-nano scale) on the surface [29,41,42]. Hence, our micro-dripping mode, which ejected several micro-sized unbroken droplets uniformly on the substrate, was suitable for fabricating a fine micrometer scale pattern with PS-brush [43]. The pattern width of the PS-brush was investigated depending on the printing speed. Fig. 1c reveals that the width of the pattern decreased as the printing speed increased: the line widths were 228, 163, 130, 112, 57, 19, and 6\u00a0\u03bcm for printing speeds of 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 15\u00a0mm/s respectively. This decreasing trend of pattern width may be caused by the decrease in the volume of solution deposited per unit time as the printing speed increased, thus obstructing line spreading [44]. The micro-dripping mode of the PS-brush solution allowed production of sub-10 \u00b5m scaled fine patterns with various shapes at the 6-\u03bcm printing condition (Fig. 1d), and such results are expected to expand the fabrication of wettability patterns with EHD printing in various applications. A grid-shaped wettability pattern was first fabricated using the aforementioned method using EHD printing process (Fig. 2 a). Then, the solution of carbon nanomaterials was deposited on the wettability patterns using spin casting. Fig. 2b and c exhibit the OM image of the pattern of CNTs which were used as the S/D electrodes of the OFETs. As can be observed in the OM image, the square shaped CNTs with a side of 60\u00a0\u03bcm were obviously patterned in a place where the wettability patterns were not applied. These results supported that different wetting characteristics were successfully obtained from the wettability patterns. Additionally, the CNT electrode patterns were fabricated with uniform size over a wide range on the Si wafer. The morphology of the CNT electrode patterns was investigated using SEM measurements, as shown in Fig. 2c. It is obvious from the SEM image that the patterned CNTs were clearly found and existed in highly tangled tubes in the regions not treated with the PS-brush. In addition, the patterns showed a clear edge along the wettability pattern lines (see magnified image in Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the CNT/graphene composite could be used to fabricate carbon-based electrode patterns using the previous described method (Fig. S2). The pattern shapes of the CNT/graphene composite were similar to those of CNTs according to the OM image (Fig. S2a). However, the SEM measurement showed that the CNT/graphene composite formed a pattern with a relatively less distinct edge line (Fig. S2b). These results may arise because the CNT/graphene composite formed folded graphene nano-sheets and interpenetrating CNT nets, which form relatively larger lumps than CNTs and form rugged edges [45,46]. Nevertheless, the CNT/graphene composites were not coated in the sub-micron sized region treated by PS-brush. Also, the difference between the work function (\u03a6) of graphene and CNTs allowed. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the adjustment of the \u03a6 of the electrode by fabricating composite materials. As described in Fig. S3, the surface potential of the carbon-based materials was investigated using UPS analyses. The kinetic energy for the expression of secondary electrons, which is defined as the difference between the vacuum level of the sample and the detectors [47], can be used as an indicator to determine the degree of surface potential. This means that a higher kinetic energy indicates a higher surface potential. In our case, the kinetic energy increased when graphene was added to the CNTs. In addition, \u03a6, which is calculated from the energy difference between the Fermi level and vacuum level based on UPS energy distribution curves (Fig. S3), was 4.71\u00a0eV for CNTs and 4.52\u00a0eV for the CNT/graphene composite. This decreasing trend was related to the composition of the film. It is known that graphene has a work function value of 4.3\u20134.5\u00a0eV, and the work function of CNTs used in our study was 4.71\u00a0eV [48\u201350]. As illustrated in Fig. 3 a, the CNT electrode patterns fabricated through the wettability patterning technique were used as the S/D electrodes for OFETs. The active layers were deposited with organic semiconductor by using a vacuum (pentacene) or a solution process (TIPS-PEN) on the grid-shape S/D electrodes to fabricate bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) OFETs. The devices were operated in the saturation regime with gate voltage (VG) from 5 to \u221220\u00a0V and S/D voltage (VD) of \u221220\u00a0V. As shown in Fig. 3b, both the transfer curves showed device operation properties with negligible hysteresis, which is the difference between OFF-to-ON and ON-to-OFF transfer curves. Generally, the hysteresis formed in OFETs is caused by the traps at the semiconductor/insulator interface or in the insulator bulk [51\u201353]. In anti-clockwise loop direction hysteresis, the transfer curve during the ON-to-OFF sweep shifts toward negative VG values for p-type transistors compared with the OFF-to-ON sweep case and is induced by the long-lived charge traps that are formed at the semiconductor/dielectric interface [53]. Another case known as clockwise loop direction hysteresis involves slow polarization of the insulator bulk originating from several factors such as polar functionalities, ionic impurities, and water molecules [53]. Therefore, our negligible hysteresis transfer characteristics were caused by the PS-brush, which was processed to fabricate the wettability pattern. The chlorosilane group of the PS-brush effectively reacted and bonded with the hydroxyl group on the SiO2 surface. As a result, the reduction in the number of polar moieties on the dielectric surface decreased the charge trap formation and diffusion\u2013absorption of the active species like O2 and H2O on the semiconductor/dielectric interface [54]. These results revealed that our non-lithographical method through PS-brush treatments not only lead to high-resolution CNT electrode pattern but also minimized the charge traps in the dielectric layers, yielding low hysteresis behavior and high performance [55]. Additionally, the transfer electrical properties of devices were extracted from the equation between drain current (ID) and VG: ID=\u03bcFETCiW2L(VG-Vth)2 where \u03bcFET is field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance of dielectric layers (~30 nF cm\u22122), and Vth is threshold voltage. The electrical properties of the OFETs are summarized in Table 1 . The case of TIPS-PEN showed a transistor performance with a \u03bcFET value of 0.172\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and ON/OFF ratio of 105, whereas that of pentacene exhibited a \u03bcFET value of 0.132\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and ON/OFF ratio of 105. In addition, both cases displayed typical p-type transistor characteristics with remarkable linear/saturation switching behavior under stepwise VG elevation, and the output ID values were well matched with the trend of electrical performance and saturated ID in the transfer curve (Fig. 3c). However, there is a difference in the electrical performances between the two types of devices, which is caused by the formation mechanism or arrangement of organic small molecule crystals [56\u201358].  In case of BGBC OFETs, the organic semiconductors are simultaneously deposited on both the channels and S/D electrodes. Thus, the morphological discontinuity of the organic semiconductors deposited on the channels and S/D electrodes could prevent charge carrier injection and increase contact resistance [59,60]. Therefore, the morphologies of pentacene and TIPS-PEN on the channel (PS-brush) and electrode (CNT) regions can affect the electrical performance of OFETs. In this regard, the morphological analysis were investigated using several tools (i.e., CPOM, AFM, and 2D-GIXD). Firstly, the morphology of the surface was analyzed before and after the deposition of pentacene by AFM. Fig. 4 a and d present the AFM images of the PS-brush (channel) and CNT (electrode) area before deposition. Fig. 4a shows a featureless surface morphology of the PS-treated region with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness value of 0.278\u00a0nm. In contrast, individual CNTs can be clearly seen in Fig. 4d and showed an RMS value of 22.1\u00a0nm. These differences in surface morphologies can significantly affect the morphology of vacuum-deposited organic semiconductors. Fig. 4b and e show the morphologies of 50-nm pentacene deposited on the channel and electrode regions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, pentacene on the channels exhibited the typical shape of pentacene crystals and had a grain size of 0.8\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm. As noted in previous studies, pentacene grew via a \u201clayer\u00a0+\u00a0island\u2019\u2019 growth mode, also known as the Stranski\u2013Krastanov mode, on a highly smooth PS-treated dielectric layer [61,62]. The surface affinity between PS and pentacene induced the formation of a percolated layer of 2D crystals under our deposition conditions (25 \u00b0C, 0.1\u00a0\u00c5/s) [61]. After the percolated layer of pentacene covered the surface of the PS-treated dielectric layer, the pentacene crystal islands grew vertically, as shown in Fig. 4b. In contrast, Fig. 4e shows that the morphology of pentacene is very similar to that of the underlying morphology of CNTs rather than the morphology typically observed for pentacene. As mentioned before (Fig. 4d), pristine CNTs displayed lots of empty spaces between each CNT and a high surface roughness. These factors induced the isotropic growth of pentacene with a grain size approximately 300\u00a0nm smaller than that of the channel region and could not lead to typical growth of pentacene crystal grains. To further understand the orientation of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "pentacene in the channel and electrode regions, 2D-GIXD measurement was used, as shown in Fig. 4c and f. Fig. 4c shows the 2D-GIXD images of pentacene in the channel regions. Intense (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks induced by the thin-film phase of pentacene along the out-of-plane direction [32] and other diffraction peaks including (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01), (0\u00a02), and (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02) along the in-plane direction were observed. These results showed the typical crystalline orientation of pentacene, which coincided with that of a thin film polymorphous pentacene phase [32,61,62]. In contrast, the pentacene deposited on electrodes showed a different crystal orientation. As described in Fig. 4f, the (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks were found not only in the out-of-plane direction but also in the in-plane direction. Especially, the (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks formed a complete ring pattern shape, and (0\u00a00\u00a02) peaks showed arcs of diffracted intensity. In addition, the nearly semicircular shape of the (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01), (0\u00a02), and (1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02) peaks, which showed intense and sharp peaks in the PS-brush case, was observed. This extraordinary result indicates a drastic change in orientation of pentacene along the c-axis, which aligned with no preference for a specific crystallographic orientation or distributed crystallographic orientation [63]. From the 2D-GIXD image, however, the crystal orientation cannot be determined accurately because the diffraction peaks overlap. Next, we performed NEXAFS spectroscopy in partial electron yield (PEY) mode to obtain the molecular orientation of pentacene semiconductor at the interface between electrodes and the channel region and the deposited pentacene. NEXAFS analysis is used to find the average conformation of molecules in a \u03c0-orbital, single bond, and double bond by detecting the X-ray absorption [64]. NEXAFS spectroscopy was performed for 1.5\u00a0nm and 15\u00a0nm thicknesses of pentacene. As shown in Fig. 5 a\u2013b, and d\u2013e, various polarization angles (\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a030, 45, 55, and 70\u00b0) of the incident X-ray beam were used on the 1.5 and 15\u00a0nm samples, and the tilt angle of the conjugated plane was calculated by plotting the intensity of the corresponding resonance. The peaks at \u03c0* (C C) orbitals were displayed at 279.5 and 281.45\u00a0eV, whereas the peaks at \u03c3* (C C) orbitals were expressed above 285\u00a0eV. The azimuthal average tilting angle (\u03b1) between the C C bond in the conjugated planes was determined by the following equation [65]: Iv\u221dP31+123cos2\u03b8-13cos2\u03b1-1+(1-P)2sin2\u03b1 where P\u00a0=\u00a01 is used for the degree of polarization [66,67]. As described in Fig. 5c and f, we plotted the \u03c0* resonance as a function of cos\u03b8 and found the dichroic ratio (R) and \u03b1 of the pentacene on CNTs (electrodes) and PS-brush (channels). The \u03b1 values for the 1.5\u00a0nm pentacene layer on the CNT was not obtained because the highly rough surface of CNT induced randomly oriented growth of pentacene crystals or hindered the growth of pentacene crystals. In contrast, the \u03b1 values were found to be 57.6\u00b0 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.11), 60.34\u00b0 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.21), and 65.6\u00b0 (R\u00a0=\u00a00.42) for 15\u00a0nm pentacene depositions on CNTs and 1.5- and 15-nm pentacene deposition on PS-brush, respectively. These results indicated the edge-on orientation of pentacene crystals against the substrate except for the 1.5-nm pentacene on CNTs. However, the difference between tilting angle according to the substrates (57.6\u00b0 and 65.6\u00b0) could induce discontinuity between pentacene deposited on CNTs and PS-brush, which makes charge transport difficult. Likewise, morphological analysis of semiconductor was performed with TIPS-PEN. Fig. 6 shows the crystalline consequence of TIPS-PEN deposited on the CNTs and PS-brush with CPOM, AFM, and 2D-GIXD. CPOM measurements revealed the birefringence of TIPS-PEN crystals [68]; the structures of TIPS-PEN deposited on CNTs and PS-brush had dendritic or comet-shaped crystals elongated by several hundred micrometers (Fig. 6a and d). The colors of crystals varied because of the variations in the TIPS-PEN crystal orientation and thickness [18,69]. In addition, the AFM data illustrated the similar comet shape of the TIPS-PEN crystals deposited on the CNTs and PS-brush (Fig. 6b and e). Additionally, the height profiles of crystals in Fig. S5 showed that the step-height of the layer in the crystals coincides with the multiple value of c-axis distance in a TIPS-PEN single molecular layer (~1.7\u00a0nm) [69,70]. This indicated that the crystals were vertically formed, layer-by-layer crystalline structures. Additionally, the 2D-GIXD images of TIPS-PEN deposited on CNTs and PS-brush showed that both crystalline structures were oriented along the (0\u00a00\u00a01) crystallographic direction with conventional edge-on orientation patterns (Fig. 6c and d) [31,69,71]. From these images, the d-spacing of (0\u00a00\u00a01) peaks, calculated using d\u00a0=\u00a02\u03c0/qz, was d 010\u00a0=\u00a016.43 and 16.44\u00a0\u00c5 for the CNTs and PS-brush, respectively. These values were comparable to previously reported data about well aligned layer-by-layer structured TIPS-PEN crystals [58,70] and coincided with previous AFM analyzations. Thus, the TIPS\u2013PEN molecules deposited on the CNT and PS-brush had similar orientation of crystals. As shown in Fig. S6, the TIPS\u2013PEN molecules deposited on previously mentioned grid-shape CNTs were continuously connected regardless of the area (channel and electrode region). Therefore, the solution-processed TIPS-PEN is better suited than vacuum-processed pentacene to be used as an active layer for our OFETs fabricated with non-lithographic carbon electrode patterning with respect to crystalline alignment continuity and printable devices.  We introduced wettability patterns by direct coating of EHD printing with carbon nanomaterials (CNTs or CNT/graphene composites) for use as S/D electrodes in OFETs. The wettability patterns were fabricated with a PS-brush, and up to 6-\u00b5m wide lines and various shapes were formed via the simple micro-dripping mode of EHD printing. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of the PS-brush, the solution with carbon nanomaterials was selectively wetted on the non-treated region of the dielectric surface. Thus, we obtained high-resolution carbon nanomaterial electrode pattern without using a lithographic process. Additionally, the PS-brush functionalization of the dielectric surface during pretreatment could minimize the formation of charge traps and diffusion\u2013absorption of the active species on the semiconductor/dielectric interface, resulting in hysteresis-free OFET operation. In addition, we identified the morphological continuity of two types of organic semiconductor. Using the various analyzing tools such as CPOM, AFM, 2D-GIXD, NEXAFS, pentacene can be detrimental to charge transport performance due to large discontinuities between S/D and channel, and in the case of TIPS-PEN, a continuous morphology can be formed, which can be a. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "good phenomenon for charge transport.

The semiconductors with moderate bandgap are used as photoelectrodes for light absorption. Under solar illumination, photogenerated electron-hole pairs are separated and transported to the solid/electrolyte interfaces. The electrons are consumed for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and holes are employed for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. The reaction in alkaline aqueous solution is expressed as the following equation: Anode (OER): 4OH-\u2192 O2 + 4e- + 2H2O Cathode (HER): 2H2O + 2e- \u2192 H2 + 2OH- Overall: 2H2O \u2192 2H2 + O2 The OER, which is a 4-electron-transfer process, is challenging because of sluggish reaction and the requirement of substantial energy of 1.23\u00a0V , and thus determines the overall PEC efficiency. To deal with it, OER can be conducted with other favorable (photo)electrochemical reactions, which can be triggered at a lower potential. In this regard, urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising reaction since its thermodynamic potential is 0.37\u00a0V and the utility of pollutant urea to valuable fuels . Various electrocatalysts for urea oxidation have been reported and introduced to photoanodes as cocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation . An n-type silicon, 2nd abundant element in the earth crust, has been widely utilized in photovoltaics and microelectronics because of its long carrier lifetime and high crystallinity . Considering the required aspects for the photoelectrode material (i.e., absorption of the solar spectrum, cost-effectiveness, and long carrier diffusion length), Si is a prime candidate to be employed for PEC devices. However, exploiting Si as photoanode is challenging because of its instability in aqueous electrolytes and low catalytic activity . The valence band position of silicon is more negative than the oxidation potential (H2O/O2), requiring a large applied potential. Also, its theoretical photovoltage is ~750\u00a0mV , which is insufficient for driving water splitting reaction. In the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to preventing Si from being corroded by introducing protection layers with chemical stability and catalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes . Especially, metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) architecture is a promising candidate for Si photoanodes. Because MIS structure prevents the surface recombination originating from the metal-induced gap states compared to the direct metal-semiconductor Schottky junction and increase barrier height, leading to the large photovoltage output . To maximize the barrier height, which is the driving force for generating photovoltage, interface engineering of MIS photoanodes has been conducted by inserting ultrathin tunneling oxide layer (e.g., HfOx, Al2O3, TiO2, SiOx) using high-vacuum types of equipment . The introduction of efficient co-catalysts with optical transparency on MIS photoanode can accelerate the PEC activity at low overpotential. Loget et al. reported the Si/SiOx/Ni MIS structures with Ni-Prussian blue derivative (NiFePB) . Similar work was done using CoFePB and NiRuPB with inhomogeneity of metal thin film for OER and UOR . Recently, amorphous Ni-Mo-O coatings with the optically adaptive property were introduced on n-Si/SiOx/Ni MIS photoanodes as UOR catalysts . From an integrated point of view, however, studies on the integrated analysis of MIS photoanodes by engineering each layer, such as the effects of physical/chemical properties of the insulating layer and metal composition on OER and UOR performance, are still intriguing. In this article, we report the tailored MIS photoanodes for water and urea oxidation and investigate their properties by manipulating the insulating SiOx layer using chemical etching methods, the composition of NixFe1\u2212x metal thin films, and incorporation of additional Ni(OH)2 catalyst via electrodeposition. We show that the status of the SiOx layer has a huge effect on the properties of MIS photoanodes. With the native SiOx insulating layer, composition control of NixFe1\u2212x metal thin film improves the photovoltages and exhibits catalytic activity. A systematic study reveals that introducing additional Ni(OH)2 catalysts on Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si leads to a higher fill factor of over 25% and enhances the charge transfer kinetics and stability. With the aids of perovskite/Si tandem solar cell, wired photovoltaic (PV)-PEC tandem device generates a photocurrent of 8.8\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, corresponding to the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 10.8% under zero bias. We finally demonstrate that optimized Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si generates high performance toward OER and shows a low onset potential of 0.83\u00a0V vs. RHE for UOR. These results indicate the design of efficient MIS photoanodes consisting of abundant materials toward clean H2 production using urea-containing wastewater.  Phosphorous-doped n-Si wafer ((100) oriented, single-side polished, 1\u02d75\u00a0\u03a9\u2219cm) was cut into 1.5\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0cm pieces. All wafer pieces were cleaned with acetone, isopropanol alcohol, and ultrapure water by ultrasonication. The Si wafers without any etching process were denoted as SiOx/n-Si. To further control the SiOx layer, first, we conducted a conventional RCA-2 etching process (denoted as SiOx,RCA/n-Si); Si pieces were soaked in 3/1\u00a0v/v concentrated H2SO4/H2O2 solution for 10\u00a0min, immersed in a buffered HF etchant for 30\u00a0sec, and cleaned with DI water. Then wafers were soaked in 5/1/1 (by volume) concentrated H2O, hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen peroxide at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Finally, the Si pieces were rinsed with ultrapure water and dried under a flow of N2. Second, n-Si wafers were soaked in buffered oxide etchant (7:1, J. T. Baker) for 30\u00a0s to remove the residual SiOx layer (denoted as SiOx,BOE/n-Si). Transition metal thin layers were deposited on silicon substrate by electron beam evaporator (Rocky Mountain Vacuum Tech.). Applied e-beam voltage was set at 7.5\u00a0kV, and a base pressure was maintained in the range of 10\u22126 Torr. All transition metal thin film layers were deposited with the rate of 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0s\u22121.

Then, copper wire was attached on top of the InGa alloy using conductive silver paste.

Electrodeposition of Ni(OH)2 was conducted in a standard three-electrode system; an encapsulated Si electrode as the working electrode, a Pt mesh as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Electrolytes were prepared by dissolving 0.004\u00a0M nickel nitrate hydrate (NiNO3\u22196\u00a0H2O, Daejung) and 0.01\u00a0M potassium nitrate (KNO3, Daejung) and kept at the temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Electrodeposition of Ni(OH)2 was conducted by applying \u02d70.15\u00a0mA for 10\u00a0s. After electrodeposition, Si pieces were rinsed with deionized water, dried under nitrogen gases, and Kapton tapes were removed. For the rear side of the Si cell, 80-nm-thick ITO films were deposited using sputter, and 300-nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator. For the front side of Si cell, 20-nm-thick ITO films were formed as the recombination layer. On top of the ITO/silicon bottom cell, PTAA/perovskite/C60 layer was deposited sequentially. PTAA solution (5\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121 in toluene) was spin-coated at 6000\u00a0rpm for 25\u00a0s, followed by annealing at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. For the preparation of 3D perovskites, solutions were prepared by dissolving formamidinium (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), CsI, PbI2, and PbBr2. The molar ratio was adjusted to form stoichiometric FA0.65MA0.20Cs0.15)Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 in mixed solvent system (DMF:NMP = 4:1 (v/v)). 2D additive perovskite solution was prepared by adding 2\u00a0mol% Pb(SCN)2 and 2\u00a0mol% PEAX (=I, SCN) to the 3D perovskite solution. The prepared solution was spin-coated at 4000\u00a0rpm for the 20\u00a0s on PTAA film. To fully crystallize the spin-coated films, it was immersed in diethyl ether (DE) for 30\u00a0s. After immersing in DE, the color of the film changed to dark brown, indicating the formation of crystallized perovskite films. The crystallized film was annealed at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. On top of the perovskite, C60 layers (C60, bathocuproine (BCP), Ag electrode) were deposited using a thermal evaporator. A 0.2\u00a0wt% of PEIE (80% ethoxylated solution) in methyl alcohol was spin-coated at 6000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s. ITO films were deposited on the C60/PEIE layer using sputtering at room temperature. A 150-nm-thick Ag metal grid was deposited using a thermal evaporator on the ITO film to fabricate final monolithic perovskite/Si tandem cells. The morphologies and microstructures of samples were analyzed by field emission scanning microscopy (MERLIN Compact, JEISS) and transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100\u00a0F, JEOL). GIXRD (X\u2032pert Pro, PANalytical) analysis was conducted to confirm the phase of NixFe1\u2212x. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AXIS-His, KRATOS) analysis was performed to investigate the surface bonding of samples. The narrow spectrums were analyzed using CASAXPS software. The reflectance of the sample was determined by UV-Vis (V-770, JASCO). ICP-MS (NexION 350D, Perkin-Elmer) analysis was conducted to confirm the dissolution of NixFe1\u2212x films. PEC measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system using a potentiostat (Ivium nStat, Ivium Technologies) with Pt mesh as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (KCl sat.) as a reference electrode. A light source was Xe arc lamp (LS 150, Abet Technologies), and the intensity of the light from the solar simulator with AM 1.5\u00a0G filter was calibrated using a reference photodiode (S300, McScience) to be 1 sun (100\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u22122). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency was measured using a monochromator (MonoRa150) and solar simulator by applying 1.23\u00a0V and 1.5\u00a0V (vs. RHE). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by using the alternating current with an amplitude of 10\u00a0mV and applying the onset potential of the samples. The sweeping frequency ranged from 250\u00a0kHz to 1\u00a0Hz. The Nyquist plots were fit to the equivalent circuit using the Z plot 2.x software. According to the Nernst equation, the measured potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale: ERHE=EAg/AgCl+EAg/AgCl\u00b0+0.059\u00d7pHwhere ERHE is the potential versus RHE, EAg/AgCl is the experimentally measured potential versus Ag/AgCl (KCl sat.), EAg/AgCl\u00b0 is 0.198\u2009V at 25\u2009\u00b0C, and the pH of the 1\u2009M NaOH electrolyte is 14. The charge injection efficiency (\u03a6inj) of the sample was calculated using LSV curves in 1\u2009M NaOH with or without 0.5\u2009M Na2SO3, where Na2SO3 was used as a hole scavenger: JPEC=Jabs\u2a2f\u03a6sep\u2a2f\u03a6inj JNa2SO3=Jabs\u2a2f\u03a6sep where JPEC is the measured photocurrent density and Jabs is an ideal photocurrent density, assuming that all absorbed photons are converted to current.  We prepared three types of SiOx layers (SiOx, SiOx,RCA, SiOx,BOE) to investigate the effects of controlling SiOx on photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of Si photoanodes. Further details of preparing SiOx layers are provided in the Experimental Section. Contact angle measurements were conducted to investigate the surface wetting properties of Si substrates with controlled SiOx. As shown in Fig. 1(a)-(c), contact angles of SiOx/n-Si, SiOx,RCA/n-Si, and SiOx,BOE/n-Si were 47\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and 83\u00b0, respectively. It has been reported that Si completely covered with oxides or \u2013OH terminated Si is hydrophilic and stable while Si-H surface or Si-CHx is hydrophobic . By using chemical etching methods, we obtained Si with different surface termination: SiOx has oxide cover, SiOx,RCA has \u2013OH terminated surface, and SiOx,BOE has Si-H surface. Fe thin films were deposited on n-Si substrates with a distinctive SiOx layer using an e-beam evaporator to form metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structured photoanodes. Fig. S1 shows the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Fe thin films on Si, where Fe 2p3/2 peak consists of Fe3+ (710.3\u2009eV and 713.2\u2009eV) peaks and Fe3+ satellite peak (718.8\u2009eV). O 1\u2009s peak can be deconvoluted into three peaks which represent Fe-O (529.6\u2009eV), Fe-O-H (531.4\u2009eV), and H-O-H (533.2\u2009eV) bonding . Fig. 1(d)-(f) shows a high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of Fe/SiOx/n-Si, Fe/SiOx,RCA/n-Si, and Fe/SiOx,BOE/n-Si interface. Fe thin films were uniformly deposited on the substrates, having a thickness of ~4\u2009nm. The Fe/SiOx/n-Si and Fe/SiOx,RCA/n-Si showed a similar SiOx thickness of 1.5\u2009nm between the Si substrate and Fe film, while Fe/SiOx,BOE/n-Si showed damaged interface between Fe layer and Si (orange). It has been reported that HF-treated Si can have a rough silicon surface , and the obtained cross-sectional HRTEM image of Fe/SiOx,BOE/n-Si shows the increase in roughness of the surface and two distinctive layers compared to SiOx and SiOx,RCA. The PEC performances of insulating SiOx-controlled photoanodes were investigated by measuring linear sweep voltammetry curves in 1\u2009M NaOH electrolyte under 1sun illumination (100\u2009mW\u2009cm\u22122). All PEC measurements were. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "conducted under the AM 1.5\u2009G using a solar simulator (ABET Technologies). The spectral irradiances of the solar simulator and AM 1.5\u2009G are shown in Fig. S2. Considering the 100% of external quantum efficiency of the system, the integrated current density based on the spectral irradiance of the solar simulator showed a slightly higher current density than AM 1.5\u2009G system. Fig. 1(g) and 1(h) show the J-V curves of Fe/SiOx/n-Si and Fe/SiOx,RCA/n-Si, respectively. We define the onset potential as a potential which is required to reach the photocurrent of 1\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122. Fe/SiOx/n-Si showed an onset potential of 1.14\u2009V vs. RHE, while that of Fe/SiOx,RCA/n-Si was 1.26\u2009V vs. RHE, which shifted to the anodic direction. In the case of Fe/SiOx,BOE/n-Si, drastic degradation of J-V performance was observed, as shown in Fig. 1(i), which might have originated from the presence of a defective SiOx layer as shown in Fig. 1(f). Therefore, it can be observed that the native SiOx layer can form a proper MIS junction by separating metal and Si, preventing surface recombination. To evaluate the catalytic effects of the composition of metal thin films on MIS photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation, the Ni/Fe ratio of metal thin films was controlled by an e-beam evaporator. The performance of MIS photoanode is significantly affected by the thickness of the insulator and metal film, changing the extent of band bending . Therefore, the same thickness of the composition-controlled NixFe1\u2212x thin films was introduced to exclude the thickness-dependent characteristics in MIS photoanodes. The thickness of native SiOx was fixed to ~ 2\u2009nm, and the metallic NixFe1\u2212x thin films were deposited with ~4\u2009nm thickness. As shown in Fig. S3, introducing NixFe1\u2212x thin layers on silicon substrates increased the light reflection due to the nature of reflecting light. Targets with Ni/Fe ratio of 1:0. 9:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:9, and 0:1 were used to control the composition of NiFe thin films on SiOx/n-Si photoanodes. Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis revealed that e-beam deposited metal thin films on silicon were an amorphous phase (Fig. S4). An n-type semiconductor can form a Schottky junction with high work-function metals . As shown in Fig. S5, the metal\u2019s work function was derived by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Ni has a work function of 4.41\u2009eV, Ni0.5Fe0.5 of 3.8\u2009eV, and Fe of 3.81\u2009eV. As the metal\u2019s work function is close to the Fermi level of n-Si, the onset potential shifted to the cathodic direction. We conducted XPS analysis to figure out the chemical states of the metal thin films. As shown in Fig. S6, deconvoluted narrow Ni 2p spectra revealed the presence of metallic Ni0 peak (852.2\u2009eV) and partial Ni2+ peak (854.5\u2009eV) for Ni thin film, and Ni 2p and Fe 2p spectra showed metallic Ni0 peak (852.5\u2009eV) and Ni2+ peak (855\u2009eV) and Fe3+ peaks (710.3\u2009eV and 712.4\u2009eV) for Ni0.5Fe0.5 thin film . We prepared NixFe1\u2212x thin films on metallic p++-Si and semiconducting n-Si, respectively, to evaluate electrochemical/photoelectrochemical characteristics. The overpotential of p++-Si was calculated using the potential difference between the required potential to reach 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 and water oxidation potential (1.23\u2009V vs. RHE). As shown in Fig. 2(a), Fe thin films on p++-Si showed a high overpotential of 420\u2009mV compared to that of 300\u2009mV for Ni/SiOx/p++-Si. Through the J-V curves, Ni-rich thin films showed more favorable electrochemical properties for water oxidation than Fe-rich thin films. We converted the polarization curves to Tafel plots to investigate the catalytic activity of NixFe1\u2212x thin films. Fig. 2(b) shows the Tafel slopes of NixFe1\u2212x thin films, in which the linear portion of the curves was used. Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/p++-Si showed the lowest Tafel slope of 42.46\u2009mV dec\u22121. Fig. 2(c) shows the J-V curves of composition-controlled NixFe1\u2212x/SiOx/n-Si under 1 sun illumination. Contrary to the J-V curves of NixFe1\u2212x/SiOx/p++-Si, the NixFe1\u2212x/SiOx/n-Si photoanodes showed different tendency regarding the onset potential (V at 1\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122). Fe/SiOx/n-Si showed a lower onset potential of 1.14\u2009V vs. RHE compared to that of 1.26\u2009V vs. RHE for Ni/SiOx/n-Si. By manipulating the composition of NixFe1\u2212x, the lowest onset potential of 1.02\u2009V vs. RHE was achieved for Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si. MIS junction photoanodes can offer sufficient photovoltages by using thin tunnel oxides and appropriate metal with high work function . Photovoltage is defined as the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of electrons and holes. We compared the photovoltages of NixFe1\u2212x/SiOx/n-Si by calculating the onset potential (V at 1\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122) differences between n-Si and p++-Si. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the photovoltage of Ni/SiOx/n-Si was 270\u2009mV, while that of Fe/SiOx/n-Si was 510\u2009mV. By controlling the ratio of Ni and Fe, photovoltage of 530\u2009mV was achieved for Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si. The charge injection efficiency, representing the efficiency of photogenerated holes at the semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces consumed for water oxidation, was derived by the ratio of photocurrent density in 1\u2009M NaOH with and without 0.5\u2009M Na2SO3. As shown in Fig. S7, Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si showed the highest charge injection efficiency over 90% at 1.23\u2009V vs. RHE. The stability of MIS-structured Si photoanodes was investigated by conducting chronoamperometry measurements at a potential of 1.5\u2009V versus RHE in 1\u2009M NaOH electrolyte in AM 1.5\u2009G condition. As shown in Fig. S8, Ni/SiOx/n-Si was able to stand 80\u2009h without any remarkable decay of photocurrent density, while Fe/SiOx/n-Si became drastically degraded within 1-hour measurement. Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si withstood for 1\u2009h and showed continuous photocurrent decay. Chung et al. reported the activity-stability trend of Fe-M hydr(oxy)oxides and showed the quick dissolution of Fe from the electrolytes, which is well-matched with our results . We performed inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis to figure out the changes in the NixFe1\u2212x layer before and after stability measurements. We used diluted 1\u2009M NaOH electrolytes before and after stability tests. As shown in Table S1, compared to Ni/SiOx/n-Si with the negligible change of Ni content, the Fe amount of electrolytes were increased after the stability test of Fe/SiOx/n-Si. Through the stability test and ICP-MS results, it was turned out that Fe itself cannot endure in high alkaline electrolytes. Integrated results showed a trade-off between the onset potential and the stability as adjusting the NixFe1\u2212x composition. Additional Ni(OH)2 catalysts were introduced on Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si via. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "cathodic electrodeposition method to expedite water oxidation reaction. We denote the photoanodes as x-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si, where x is the deposition time (seconds). As shown in the photographs of the MIS photoanodes with/without catalysts, the difference was indistinguishable by the naked eyes ( Fig. 3(a)). The surface morphology of Ni(OH)2 was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The faint morphology of 10-Ni(OH)2 was confirmed as shown in Fig. 3(b). As the deposition time increases, the shape of the Ni(OH)2 becomes distinct (Fig. S9). To further characterize the structure of MIS samples, cross-section TEM analysis was conducted. As shown in Fig. 3(c), conformal Ni0.5Fe0.5 thin film was formed on top of the SiOx/Si. The thickness of Ni0.5Fe0.5 thin film and SiOx were 3.5\u2009nm and 1.5\u2009nm, respectively. After the electrodeposition, 3\u2009nm-thick Ni(OH)2 was formed uniformly on Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si, and the thickness of the SiOx layer was slightly\u3000increased up to 1.8\u2009nm (Fig. 3(d)). A TEM equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was conducted to discriminate the elemental distributions of MIS photoanodes. The cross-sectional TEM images and EDS mappings show uniform thin film and Ni, Fe, and O distributions (Fig. S10). The increase of Ni and O signals of 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si indicates the presence of Ni(OH)2. The formation of Ni(OH)2 on Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si was confirmed by XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. S11(a-c). Compared to the XPS spectra of Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si, the metallic Ni 2p peak disappeared, and only the Ni2+ peak was observed at 855.5\u2009eV. In the case of O 1\u2009s spectra, a significant M-OH peak was found at 530.9\u2009eV. The PEC performances of the MIS photoanodes with or without catalysts were evaluated in 1\u2009M NaOH electrolyte under simulated 1 sun illumination in the three-electrode system. Fig. 4(a) shows the J-V characteristics of the Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode with/without catalysts. The onset potential of Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode was 1.02\u2009V vs. RHE, and photocurrent density of 33.3\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 was recorded at 1.23\u2009V vs. RHE. After introducing 10-Ni(OH)2 catalysts on Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode, the 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si showed 220\u2009mV negative onset potential than the water oxidation potential and the saturated current density of 41\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, which reveals that thickness of the Ni(OH)2 is adequate to display the catalytic property without disturbing light absorption of silicon. After the LSV measurements, Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5 catalysts on SiOx/n-Si maintained the same chemical status as shown in Fig. S11(d-f). We calculated the half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies (HC-STH) of photoanodes from their LSV curves. As shown in Fig. S12(a), the maximum HC-STH of 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode reaches 2.5% at 1.13\u2009V vs. RHE without buried junction, which exceeds the MIS photoanode without Ni(OH)2 catalysts (1.5% at 1.14\u2009V vs. RHE). As the thickness of Ni(OH)2 increased, the height of the oxidation peak increased (Fig. S12(b)). Since the thick Ni(OH)2 layer disturbs the light absorption of Si, the saturated current density of x-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si decreased from 40\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 to 27\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 while a slight change of onset potential was observed. A factor indicating the cell\u2019s power efficiency is represented as a fill factor (FF). Fill factor is a concept used in photovoltaic and refers to the ratio of the product of current and voltage at the maximum output point to the product of short circuit current and open circuit voltage. From the rectangularity at the maximum power point, we calculated the FF of the photoanodes by deriving the rectangularity of the J-V property, followed by the equation: FF=IMP\u00d7(1.23\u2212VMP)ISC\u00d7(1.23\u2212VON) where the IMP and VMP are the current density and potential at the maximum power point, ISC is the photocurrent density at 1.23\u2009V vs RHE and EON is the onset potential. The power efficiency of the photoanode produced by applying FF to the photoelectrode was calculated. When the Ni(OH)2 catalysts were introduced on Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si, FF was about 25.73%, showing an increase in efficiency by about 8% compared to the Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si. The increase of FF is advantageous in view of shifting the working potential toward a cathodic direction, leading to the construction of efficient pn PEC cells . To investigate the electrochemical activity of the catalysts, we prepared the same catalysts on metallic p++-Si, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Prepared Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/p++-Si showed the overpotential (at 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122) of 320\u2009mV, which was 60\u2009mV lower than that of Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/p++-Si, expediting the OER activity. To investigate charge transport properties, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was conducted near the onset potential of each photoanode (Fig. 4(c)). In the Nyquist plot, small semicircles represent the fast charge transfer kinetics of the photoanodes at the interface. The equivalent circuit which was used to fit the measured EIS spectra is shown in the inset. The equivalent circuit components are charge transfer resistance (Rct) and capacitance element (C). The Rct,1 represents the contact resistance of silicon, Rct,2 the resistance between silicon and catalysts, and Rct,3 the resistance between catalysts and electrolytes. The fitted values of resistance and capacitance of MIS photoanodes with/without catalysts are summarized in Table S2. By introducing catalysts, the smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct,3) of the 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si resulted in enhanced interfacial charge transfer. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of MIS photoanodes with/without catalysts were conducted to investigate the effect of introducing Ni(OH)2 catalysts. The IPCEs of the Si photoanodes were measured in 1\u2009M NaOH electrolyte at an applied bias of 1.5\u2009V vs. RHE, where photoanodes reach the saturated current density. As shown in Fig. 4(d), both Si photoanodes showed the photo-response over the visible wavelength, which is well matched to the bandgap of silicon. By introducing Ni(OH)2 catalysts, 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode reached a value up to 90%, indicating high responsivity to the visible lights. The stability of the 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode was evaluated under 1 sun illumination (100\u2009mW\u2009cm\u22122) in 1\u2009M NaOH (pH 14) and 1\u2009M\u2009K-borate (pH 9.5) electrolytes. Compared to the stability of MIS photoanode without Ni(OH)2 catalysts (Fig. S8(b)), 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode showed improved stability up to 5\u2009h (Fig. S13(a)). However, the rapid photocurrent drop was observed after 5\u2009h, which is attributed to the instability of Fe in the alkaline electrolytes (Fig. S8(c)). The fast photocurrent decay of 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode was significantly alleviated in mild alkaline 1\u2009M\u2009K-borate electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the decrease in photocurrent was not observed for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "100\u2009h operation at a constant potential of 1.8\u2009V vs. RHE. After a continuous 100\u2009h chronoamperometric measurement, slight degradation in PEC performance was confirmed (Fig. S13(b)). By comparing the stability in alkaline electrolytes with different pH, it can be derived that corrosion of Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5 can be largely suppressed in the mild electrolyte. To further investigate whether photogenerated charge carriers are consumed for oxygen evolution reaction, the oxygen evolution of 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode was measured by gas chromatography at 1.8\u2009V vs. RHE. As shown in Fig. 4(f), the Faradaic efficiency value was close to 100% during the measurements, which indicates that all photogenerated holes are consumed for water oxidation without any side reactions. A few points showed higher than 100%, attributed to the generated O2 bubbles attached to the photoanode surface. The measured amount of oxygen increased in proportion to time, consistent with the calculated theoretical amount of oxygen generation. The photovoltage is a driving force to induce spontaneous PEC water splitting without an external bias. Through a series of experiments, optimized MIS photoanodes with oxygen evolving catalysts, generating a photovoltage of 500\u2009mV. However, still, the generated photovoltage is not ample for spontaneous water splitting reaction. The design of devices such as PV-electrolyzer (EC), PV-PEC, and PEC-PEC tandem cells has been considered as a promising approach to achieve clean hydrogen without applying bias . To make up for insufficient photovoltage output of Si photoanodes, we fabricated wired perovskite/Si tandem solar cell with the photoanode to supply ample photo-induced voltage. The schematic shown in Fig. 5(a) demonstrated that both solar cell and photoanode were in parallel light illumination with an area ratio of 1:1. The structure of the monolithic perovskite/Si tandem solar cell is illustrated in Fig. S14(a). By designing an optimal bandgap configuration of 1.7\u2009eV/1.12\u2009eV as light absorbers, perovskite/Si tandem solar cell showed the open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.8\u2009V and the short circuit current of 19.3\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 (Fig. S14(b)) . Under the two-electrode system, J-V curves of perovskite/Si tandem solar cell and 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode are shown in Fig. 5(b). The intersection of J-V curves indicates achievable photocurrent (operating current, Jop) without applying external bias. We can estimate the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency (\u03b7STH) of the PV-PEC tandem device using this point by the following equation: \u03b7STH=1.23V\u00d7Jop(mAcm\u22122)100mWcm\u22122 The expected \u03b7STH of PV-PEC tandem device is 10.77% by using Jop of 8.75\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122. The actual unassisted water splitting performance of the PV-PEC tandem device was characterized by chronoamperometry measurements at zero bias with chopped light. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the current density of 8.8\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 is achieved without external bias and practical \u03b7STH matches to 10.8% during operation for 80\u2009min. Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is one of the promising reactions in the view of hydrogen production and pollutant treatment . Similar to the water electrolysis, urea electrolysis produces H2 at the cathode using the electrical current. At the anode side, the urea oxidation reaction produces CO2 and N2 instead of O2 evolution. The overall urea electrolysis reaction is presented as the following equation: Anode: CO(NH2)2 + 6OH- \u2192 CO2 + N2 + 5H2O + 6e- Cathode: 6H2O + 6e- \u2192 3H2 + 6OH- Overall: CO(NH2)2 + H2O \u2192 CO2 + N2 + 3H2 The theoretically required voltage for urea splitting is 0.37\u2009V which is quite lower than that of water splitting (1.23\u2009V) . Urea is a naturally abundant source, originating from fertilizers, urines, industrial production wastes, and so on. The oxidation of urea is advantageous for its relatively low volatility, high energy density (16.9\u2009mJ\u2009L\u22121) in liquid fuels, and high solubility . Although UOR is a complicated 6-electron transfer process , urea can be used as sacrificial agents and more easily oxidized species in the water electrolysis electrolytes to overcome sluggish water oxidation reaction . The inclusion of urea in the electrolytes can be considered as natural electrolytes. We investigated the EC/PEC UOR performance of fabricated MIS photoanodes. Fig. 6(a) shows J-V curves of p++-Si electrodes for UOR in 1\u2009M NaOH +\u20090.33\u2009M urea, where 0.33\u2009M of urea is approximately the average molar concentration of urea in human urine . Similar to the activity of OER, Ni/SiOx/p++-Si showed a large urea oxidation peak, while Fe/SiOx/p++-Si didn't show any UOR property. The CV curves of p++-Si demonstrated the (Fig. 6(b)). Fig. 6(c) shows the LSV curves of n-Si photoanodes in the same electrolytes (1\u2009M NaOH + 0.33\u2009M urea). Compared to the electrochemical UOR properties of p++-Si, 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si showed the lowest onset potential of 0.83\u2009V vs RHE, which indicates that additional Ni(OH)2 catalyst is efficient not only for OER but also for UOR. Fe/SiOx/n-Si showed the onset potential of 1.13\u2009V vs. RHE, similar to that of water oxidation (1.14\u2009V vs. RHE). From the results, it can be estimated that Fe is not the appropriate catalyst for UOR. HC-STH conversion efficiencies for UOR were calculated based on the J-V curves of Si photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the stability of 10-Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si gradually decreased within 30\u2009min, while 5\u2009h stability was recorded in 1\u2009M NaOH electrolytes as shown in Fig. S13(a). We compared the chronoamperometric curves of UOR (at 1\u2009V vs. RHE in 1\u2009M NaOH + 0.33\u2009M urea) and OER (at 1.23\u2009V vs. RHE in 1\u2009M NaOH) of Si photoanodes to evaluate transient photocurrent decay. When the light was switched on, Si photoanodes showed a photocurrent spike and exponentially decayed to the steady-state during UOR, while the overshoots were not observed during OER (Fig. 6(e)). The presence of a photocurrent spike was the result of photogenerated electron-hole recombination. From the results, the UOR activity of Si photoanodes was hindered by charge recombination, which accelerates the degradation of the stability. We calculated the transient decay time from a logarithmic plot of parameter D, following by the equation: D=(It\u2212Is)(Im\u2212Is) where It is the photocurrent at a time (t), Im and Is are the photocurrent spike and steady-state photocurrent, respectively. The transient decay time is defined when lnD =\u2009\u22121. Fig. 6(f) shows that both Si photoanodes showed similar transient decay times for water oxidation reaction. However, in the case of UOR, the transient decay time. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "decreased compared to that of OER, and introducing Ni(OH)2 contributes to the charge recombination, although it shifted the onset potential of 90\u2009mV compared to the Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si. By integrating the OER and UOR performances of Si photoanodes in the view of photovoltages and onset potentials, composition controlled Ni0.5Fe0.5 and electrodeposited Ni(OH)2 catalysts are active toward both reactions, as shown in Fig. S15.  We demonstrated the interface engineering of MIS photoanodes and investigated their PEC water and urea oxidation performances. First, we prepared different insulating SiOx layers by chemical etching method (SiOx,RCA, SiOx,BOE) and showed that control of SiOx layer between a metal layer and semiconducting n-Si affected the surface status and interface properties, influencing the PEC performances. Second, we showed that composition control of metallic NixFe1\u2212x thin films shows opposite properties with electrochemical properties and photoelectrochemical properties, where Ni-rich films showed lower overpotentials for EC water oxidation. However, Fe-rich films showed lower onset potentials for PEC water oxidation. There was a trade-off between the stability and the onset potentials depending on the presence of Fe. The optimized Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanodes showed a high photocurrent density of 33.3\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 at 1.23\u2009V vs. RHE. By introducing additional Ni(OH)2 catalysts on Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanodes, enhanced fill factor over 25% and external quantum efficiency of 90% was achieved. By introducing perovskite/Si tandem solar cell as a voltage supplier, wired tandem cell device generated an operating photocurrent density of 8.8\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, corresponding to the STH conversion efficiency of 10.8%. Lastly, we also investigated PEC urea oxidation properties of Si photoanodes. The heterogeneous Ni(OH)2/Ni0.5Fe0.5/SiOx/n-Si photoanode showed a highly active urea oxidation property, showing the potential of Si photoanodes for an additional utility of anodic reactions. Although some issues such as stability that must be solved still remain in view of adjusting for industrial applications, these findings suggest the design of efficient MIS photoanodes to produce hydrogen in polluted water.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Since titanium dioxide (TiO2) was exploited to decompose water with visible light by Fujishima, photocatalysis has been a high potential \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d technology to meet fast-growing practical demand in energy and the environment field due to its nontoxicity, stability and low cost []. However, TiO2 only excites electrons under UV irradiation (accounts for 4% of the total solar energy) due to its relatively wide band gap (about 3.2 eV), which significantly limits its application in photocatalysis []. To mitigate the above limitation, surface modification of semiconductor on the nanoscale have been designed through doping, introducing disorder and forming composites []. Indeed, the catalysts with visible light response have been developed by doped non-metallic element (C, N, S), modified metal nanoparticles (Ag, Pt) or form heterojunction []. However, these modification strategies exist disadvantages such as heavy metal pollution, unfavorable balance between absorption and photocatalytic activity or surface modification rather than bulk doping []. Therefore, these modified materials cannot show biosafety, satisfactory photocatalytic activity or favorable reproducibility for practical application. Hence, searching an environmentally friendly photocatalytic material which can take full use of solar energy is necessary. Nowadays, organic photocatalysts are ideal candidates to solve the energy and environmental crisis because of they have the advantages of utilizing visible and NIR light adequately and avoid heavy metal pollution []. Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was reported as an organic polymer photocatalyst and has been brilliantly outstanding in photocatalytic hydrogen production due to its chemically and thermally stability, low band gap (2.7\u20132.8 eV) and adjustable energy level [,]. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pure g-C3N4 cannot satisfy the practice requirement due to its low quantum efficiency and rapid photongenerated carriers recombination. Hence, the subject matter of enhancing photocatalytic efficiency is to balance the light absorption region and photogenerated carriers of photocatalysts. Since polyacetylene (PA) doped with iodine was first reported in 1977 by MacDiarmid et al., conjugated polymers have aroused great interest in energy conversion and environmental restoration fields such as light emitting diodes, solar cells and photocatalytic degradation [,]. Conjugated polymer combines with superior electronic properties and photophysical property of inorganic semiconductors (high electrical conductivity) and advantages of organic materials (easy to shape and low cost), which are promising alternative materials for photocatalysis field []. Based on these properties, semiconductor photocatalysts embedded conjugated polymers have been studied for enhancing the photocatalytic activity []. Our previous work shows that rutile nanoparticles embedded polypyrrole (PPy) film show more outstanding photocatalytic activity rather than bare rutile under visible light []. Importantly, the conductive polymer will not undergo degradation during catalytic process. Impressively, some polymers are reported as p-type semiconductors with a bandgap about 1.5\u22123 eV, which should possess photocatalytic properties in principle []. Nevertheless, recent research based on conjugated polymer photocatalysts are still scarce. Recently, researchers reported that several conjugated polymers (Polydiphenylbutadiyne) (PDPB) and Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)) synthesized via soft templates can degrade organic pollutants efficiently in presence of visible light [,]. This gradually shifted the field of photocatalysis research from inorganic semiconductor to conjugated polymer materials. Nevertheless, due to the complexity and high cost of soft templates synthetic method, this photocatalysts are still difficult to achieve large-scale production for industrial applications. In conjugated polymer, the more coplanar structure can increase the electronic transmission efficiency, but many reports did not consider the influence of coplanar structure in conjugated polymers for photodegradation efficiency. Besides, the electronic structure and photocatalysis mechanism of conjugated polymer still remains unclear. Hence, designing a conjugated polymer photocatalyst with rapid separation rate of photogenerated carriers and high photocatalytic efficiency under visible light and systematic study the photocatalysis mechanism obviously provide a new alternative material to solve the energy and environment issues. Herein, we designed an organic conjugated polymer photocatalyst-PPy with high photodegradation efficiency via one-step low temperature polymerization. Due to the low polymerization temperature, PPy mainly forms \u03c0-conjugated structure through \u03b1-\u03b1 connection, which is one of the key factor for photongenerated carriers separation and its application in photocatalysis. Besides, PPy shows excellent light harvesting efficiency and electronic property compared with typical inorganic semiconductor (P25) and g-C3N4. Importantly, PPy will not be degraded in photocatalytic process and shows superior stability after repeated cycling. Furthermore, we present here the first demonstration of the electronic structure and photocatalysis mechanism. Thus, our research approach can develop a new organic photocatalysis with low cost, high carrier mobility. More importantly, the systematic study of photocatalysis mechanism provides theoretical guidance for designing new organic photocatalysts to solve the energy and environment issues.  Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3\u00b76H2O), sodium sulfate (NaSO4), melamine and copper sulfate (CuSO4) came from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Pyrrole (Py) (98 %) and p-benzoquinone were from Meryer Chemical Technology Co. Ltd. Ferrocene, acetonitrile and isopropanol were purchased from Damao Chemical Reagent. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate was bought from Aladdin. Ultrapure water was used and all the reagents were analytical grade. PPy photocatalyst was synthesized via one-step oxidation method. First, 1 mL Py monomer is dissolved into 100 mL ultrapure water. Then the Py aqueous solution were stirred in baths of ice. 10 min later, 50 mL FeCl3 aqueous solution was added to the above mixtures, and then stirred for 30 min. The solution stands for 12 h in 0 \u2103. After centrifugation in rotation speed 8000 r/min, PPy bulk was washed with ultrapure water and ethanol, and then dried in 60 \u2103 for 2 h. The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was prepared according to previous work []. Usually, 20 g melamine powder was placed in a covered crucible and then heated to 500 \u2103 in a tube furnace for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 \u2103 min\u22121, followed by a further heat at 520 \u2103 for 2 h. As shown Fig. S1, the XRD of g-C3N4 agree with the report, indicating g-C3N4 was synthesized successfully. The morphology of samples and elements distribution was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "FEI Verios 460). X-ray diffraction (D/max2200PC, Rigaku, with a Cu K\u03b1 radiation source) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AXIS SUPRA, using an Al K\u03b1 X-ray source) were used to characterize the chemical composition the PPy samples. Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer was used for the Ultraviolet-visible (UV\u2013vis) and Ultraviolet diffuse reflection (DRS) measurements. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra was obtained by using an FTIR spectrometer (ThermoFisher Nicolet iS5). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were acquired by using Edinburgh FS5 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Raman spectra was measured by Renishaw-invia Micro confocal laser Raman spectrometer. The photocatalytic activity of the PPy photocatalyst was evaluated by the degradation efficiency of azo dye methyl orange (MO). PPy (20 mg) was added into 50 mL 20 mg/mL MO solution and stirred for 2 h in the dark before irradiation to establish the adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Then the photocatalytic degradation rate of dye was evaluated using a 300 W Xenon lamp (CEL-S500, Beijing Zhongjiao Jinyuan Technology Co. Ltd) and the distance between the lamp and the liquid level was maintained at 10.0 cm. The whole experiments were carried out at room temperature by continuous circulating water. Next, 2 mL suspension was collected per hour and centrifuged three times (10,000 rpm, 5 min). And then the solution was transferred to a quartz cuvette and UV\u2013vis absorption spectra were measured on Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer by following the signals at wavelength 464 nm (MO) which corresponds to the maximal absorption. The normalized concentration of MO was calculated by using the equation: \u03b7%=(1-C/C0)%, where C is the measured real-time concentration, and C0 is the initial concentration of MO. For comparison, the same experiments were carried out in the absence of light and catalyst. In addition, the degradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB) by PPy was studied under the same conditions. The photoelectric property of photocatalysts was measured in a three-electrode system equipped with a single cell by an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660E, Shanghai CH Instruments Inc.). The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode (5 mm \u00d7 10 mm, 6\u20138 \u03a9) coated with different sample, SCE electrode and platinum sheet electrode served as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 7) was supporting electrolyte, and the scanning rate was 10 mV/s. The simulated solar light source is a 500 W xenon lamp (CEL-S500, Beijing Zhongjiao Jinyuan Technology Co. Ltd) which assisted by an AM 1.5 G filter and calibrated by 100 mW cm\u22122. Cyclic voltammetry curve (CV) of PPy photocatalyst were measured as recommended by IUPAC. In this system, glassy carbon electrode (1 mm diameter) coated with the sample film, Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum wire electrode were served as the working electrode, pseudo reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Besides, ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) standard potential was tested at the end of experiment to calibrate the pseudo reference electrode. Furthermore, 0.1 M Tetrabutylammonium Perchlorate acetonitrile solution was used as supporting electrolyte, and the CV scanning rate was 20 mV/s.  Py monomer was polymerized via a simple one-step chemical oxidation method. Firstly, FeCl3 oxidant acted as initiator which remove an electron from Py monomer and form a radical cation. Subsequently, the radical cation reacted with another Py monomer to generate dimer via coupling reaction, and then, this dimer was oxidized to form dimer radical cation. Finally, long chain PPy was synthesized by repeating above steps []. Theoretically, when PPy synthesized by oxidizing metal salts dopant such as FeCl3, the corresponding anions (Cl\u2212) was acted as dopants coupled with PPy backbone to form doped polypyrrole (Fig. 1 ). The whole reaction process can be expressed as follow formula: 4nC4H4NH+nA-\u2192C4H2NH\u2219An+8n-1H++8(n-1)e-+ne- SEM was performed to investigate the microstructure of PPy photocatalyst. At low magnification SEM images (Fig. 2 a), PPy shows a flocculent and porous structure, which could enhance light absorption and the transportation of organics to the internal active sites. Besides, at high magnification (Fig. 2b), PPy is nanoballs of 200\u2212400 nm diameter, hence, polymer nanospheres can be obtained via a facile low temperature method. XRD, FT-IR proved that PPy photocatalyst was synthesized successfully. As shown in Fig. 2c, broad peak at 2\u03b8 = 23\u00b0 is the characteristic diffraction peak of PPy, which indicates the PPy is amorphous state. In FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 2d), the peak at 3490 cm\u22121 corresponds to stretching vibration of N H, and peak in 1635 cm\u22121 is H O H bending mode. The peaks in 1555 cm\u22121 and 1383 cm\u22121 is related to typical PPy ring vibration and plane bending vibration of C H, respectively. In addition, the peaks attribute to C H plane vibration and C H deformation of PPy are also observed at 1299 cm\u22121 and 1030 cm\u22121, respectively. The peaks at 1170 cm\u22121 represents the characteristics of doped PPy []. In Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, the energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and element mapping reveals the presence of only C and N element and no other impurity elements. Hence, above results confirm the formation of PPy by chemical oxidative method. According to the monomer structure and polymerization mechanism of PPy, it has three polymerization modes including: \u03b1-\u03b1, \u03b1-\u03b2 and \u03b2-\u03b2 (Fig. 4 a)[]. Among them, \u03b1-\u03b1 connection possesses the most coplanar structure (\u03c0-conjugated structure) than \u03b1-\u03b2 and \u03b2-\u03b2 connection, because there is repulsion between the adjacent PPy structure to prevent the torsion of PPy chain segments. The coplanar geometry structure in \u03b1-\u03b1 connection can increase the holistic delocalization level to stabilize the radical generated by single electron transfer (polaron) or two-electron transfer (bipolaron), thereby enhancing charge transfer efficiency [,]. PPy was synthesized at a relatively low temperature, therefore, the internal polymerization modes are mainly \u03b1-\u03b1 connection. Besides, XPS spectrum and Raman spectrum were carried out to explore the element distribution and bonds in PPy. The high-resolution XPS spectra of C1 s and N1 s in PPy were shown in Fig. 4b and c. The C1 s showed three non-symmetrical peaks: 284.3 eV, 285.2 eV and 288.8 eV which represent \u03b2-C (C C), \u03b1-C (C N) and \u03c0-\u03c0\u2217 transition in PPy,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "respectively. In pyrrole monomer, the C atom relative content of \u03b2-C (C C) and \u03b1-C (C N) is 3:2 [,]. And for PPy, the C atom relative content obtained from integral area under curve was (\u03b2-C) 54 % and (\u03b1-C)32 %, respectively, which tallied with ideal structure of PPy. So the result of XPS confirm that the internal polymeric mode of PPy are mainly \u03b1-\u03b1 connection. Meanwhile, the N1 s spectra was convoluted into three species: 398.5 eV, 400.1 eV and 402.8 eV, which are correspond to imine (-N=), amine (-NH-) and positively charged nitrogen atoms (-NH+) for PPy (Fig. 4c). The -NH+ polaron is significant to enhance electrical conductivity, due to the facilitation of direct electrostatic interaction between the negative electron and positive charge. Fig. 4d was the Raman spectrum of PPy, the bands at 1551 cm\u22121 and 1355 cm\u22121 represent the stretching vibration of \u03c0 conjugated (C C) and ring stretching of PPy, respectively. The result also reveal the internal conjugated structure of prepared PPy []. In conclusion, PPy has relatively high order degree and \u03c0-conjugated structure due to \u03b1-\u03b1 connection, which could increase the electrical conductivity of PPy. PPy is a black material with high conductivity, therefore, investigate the photophysical property is vital to explore its potential photocatalytic properties. In order to reveal the superiority and mechanism of conjugated polymer PPy, UV\u2013vis diffuser reflectance spectra (DRS) of PPy and two traditional photocatalysts (P25 and g-C3N4) were conducted to research optical absorption characteristic and band gap. As shown in Fig. 5 a, P25 shows high UV absorption (absorption edge\u223c390 nm) and had a strong transition in UV region, which origin from the transition of electron in energy gap. Besides, g-C3N4 have weaker UV absorption but higher visible light absorption (absorption edges\u223c460 nm) than that of P25. However, PPy exhibits broad light absorption band covering entire UV\u2013vis region without obvious absorption edges in this region, which suggests its extensive light absorption capability. Especially in Vis-NIR region, the absorption intensity of PPy is significant higher than that of P25 and g-C3N4. This result can be attributed to the black monolithic structure and \u03c0-\u03c0\u2217 transition in conjugated structures of PPy. Whereas, the relatively light color of P25 and g-C3N4 reduce their light absorption (Fig. S3). Moreover, the band gaps (Eg) of three typical photocatalysts were estimated by Kubelka-Munk plots. As shown in Fig. 5b, the estimated results of PPy, P25 and g-C3N4 were 2.04 eV, 3.12 eV and 2.75 eV, respectively. Therefore, the narrow band gap energy of PPy benefits to the transition of photoinduced electron and utilize solar energy efficiently. In order to deeply understand solar light utilization, the light absorption of different photocatalysts under simulated solar irradiation (air mass 1.5 global, AM 1.5 G) was investigated, which was obtained by the absorbance of photocatalysts multiplied by standard terrestrial solar spectral irradiation distributions (ASTM G173). As shown in Fig. 5c, PPy absorbed the vast majority of light in 500\u22122500 nm region (the high intensity solar irradiation energy), but P25 and g-C3N4 exhibited low light absorption in this region. Besides, PPy showed an extensive and intense absorbance in whole spectral region (insert in Fig. 5c), which indicates its excellent use of solar light energy. Furthermore, in Fig. 5d, the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of three photocatalysts was provided to further illustrate the utilization of light energy in photocatalysts, the LHE was obtained by using the following equation: \u03b7 = 1-10-A(\u03bb) where A(\u03bb) is absorbance, \u03bb is wavelength. The results showed that the LHE of PPy is higher than that of P25 and g-C3N4 in 500\u22122500 nm region. In conclusion, PPy possesses excellent light absorption in whole wavelength range (200\u22122500 nm) due to the black and rough structure. This property can avoid the unnecessary reflection and increase the multiple reflections of incident light in interiorly the PPy structure. Meanwhile, due to \u03c0-\u03c0* transition, \u03c0* band to polaron band, and \u03c0-band to polaron band transitions of PPy, the transfer efficiency of photoelectron will be enhanced. Therefore, PPy can utilize most of solar energy and possesses potential of photocatalytic capacity because of its superior light harvesting efficiency in simulated solar irradiation region. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characteristics of PPy, P25 and g-C3N4 were evaluated by linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) measurement performed at a scan rate of 0.1 V\u00b7s\u22121 with a potential of -0.5 V-1.0 V under full spectrum, ultraviolet and visible light, respectively. As shown in Fig.6 a, under UV irradiation, the photocurrent density of PPy was 1.2 mA\u00b7 cm-2 at 1 V vs SCE, which was 16.67 and 91.0 folds than that of P25 (0.068 mA\u00b7 cm-2 at 1 V vs SCE) and g-C3N4 (0.001 mA\u00b7 cm-2 at 1 V vs SCE), respectively. This results are accord with UV absorption of the three materials above measured. PPy nanoparticles are black and present stronger UV absorption, and the highly delocalized conjugated structure makes convenient charge transfer, thereby has the highest photocurrent density under UV. However, for white P25 and flaxen g-C3N4, their relatively weakly light absorption results in low photocurrent density. Besides, due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, their expressed inappreciable photocurrent response. Fig. 6b displayed the photocurrent density of three different photocatalysts under visible light. It can be seen that P25 and g-C3N4 showed no obvious photocurrent density, however, the photocurrent density of PPy was 1.8 mA\u00b7 cm-2 at 1 V vs SCE. This result indicates that PPy can be excited under visible light irradiation and exhibits a high photocurrent response. Furthermore, under full spectrum irradiation PPy also showed the highest photocurrent density for three photocatalyst (1.8 mA\u00b7 cm-2 at 1 V vs SCE; Fig. 6c). This results confirm that PPy exhibits effective photogenerated charge separation and excellent photophysical properties. Fig. 6d showed the LSV curves of PPy under different illumination conditions. The visible and full spectrum photocurrent response of PPy were significantly higher than that of UV. It is noteworthy that no obvious differences can be observed in photocurrent density of PPy under full spectrum and visible light irradiation. However, for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "P25 and g-C3N4, the photocurrent density curves were different under different lights which are corresponding to their DRS. Based on the analysis of DRS and solar radiation energy region, this phenomenon can be illustrated. Firstly, optical absorption intensity region of PPy is almost agreement with solar radiation energy region, so it can utilize most of solar energy compared to P25 and g-C3N4. Although the absorption of PPy towards UV region is maximum, UV region occupy a small portion energy (calculated to be about 3%) in UV\u2013vis region. Moreover, the absorption edge near Vis-NIR region suggest that PPy can only absorb relatively lesser solar energy in NIR region, therefore, the photocurrent produced by NIR energy is inappreciable and provides no significant contribution under full spectrum. Besides, as shown in Fig. S4, under full spectrum irradiation, PPy showed a quick response to the light either on or off, which further confirmed the production of photogenerated current in PPy. Combined with the results of DRS and LSV confirm that PPy can produce photogenerated electrons under full solar spectrum, and the strong photocurrent response makes PPy a highly active photocatalyst with infinite potential. In order to further realize the origin of photocatalytic degradation process of PPy photocatalyst, its electronic properties were studied. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) were introduced to determine oxidation and reduction potential of PPy, consequently, HOMO and LUMO can be obtained by the ionization potential and the electronic affinity. In this system, ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple standard has been tested to calibrate the pseudo reference electrode (0.43 V \u03bds. Ag/AgCl, Fig. 7 a). Besides, Fig. 7b showed that the primary oxidation (p-doped) process and reduction (n-doped) peak potentials values were 1.611 V and -0.51 V vs Ag/AgCl. According to this result, the calculated band gap of PPy nanostructure is 2.12 eV, which is obviously narrower than that of P25 (3.12 eV). Meanwhile, the energy level of the LUMO and HOMO can be approximated by electron affinity and ionization potentials, respectively. Because the formal potential of ferrocene is 0.43 V vs Ag/AgCl and 0.197 V vs. NHE corresponds to 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, combined with -4.5 eV on the Fermi level to be equivalent to 0.0 V vs. NHE by Bard and Faulkner reported [], so the molecular orbital energies could be calculated directly from the formulas as follows: EHOMO=-Eonset.oxvs.Ag/AgCl+0.197+4.5-0.43eV ELUMO=-Eonset.redvs.Ag/AgCl+0.197+4.5-0.43eV which can also be expressed as follows: EHOMO=-4.697+Eonset.oxvs.Ag/AgCl-0.43eV ELUMO=-4.697+Eonset.redvs.Ag/AgCl-0.43eV Eonset.ox and Eonset.red is the oxidation potential and reduction potential of PPy in CV curve, respectively. The calculation results are -5.878 eV (HOMO) and -3.757 eV (LUMO). In consideration of -4.5 eV corresponding to 0.0 V vs NHE, the HOMO and LUMO are 1.378 V and -0.743 V vs NHE, respectively (Table 1 ). Furthermore, the Kubelka-Munk plots calculated from UV\u2013vis DRS and tangent line in XPS-VB were used to further confirm the optical band gap and valence band of PPy, which are approximately 2.04 eV and 1.38 eV, respectively (Fig. 7c and d). This results are very close with the band gap of PPy calculated from CV value (Table 2 ). Therefore, some of LUMO electrons can react with oxygen to generate active species such as \u00b7O2 \u2212 and \u00b7OH, because the LUMO of PPy is much more negative than the reduction potential of oxygen (-0.046 V vs NHE) []. Besides, the strong oxidizing property of h+ can oxidize substrates directly []. Thus, considering the thermodynamic relation, the calculated band structure and energy level of PPy were depicted in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that PPy possesses appropriate energy levels for photocatalysis and is a potential novel organic photocatalyst. Considering the semiconducting and photophysical properties of this conjugated polymer nanoparticles, the photocatalytic activity of PPy was explored by measuring the time-dependent degradation under three different light irradiations (UV, Vis and full spectrum) using methyl orange (MO) as probe. In order to compare the photocatalytic activity of PPy with typical photocatalysts, photocatalytic degradation experiments of P25 and g-C3N4 were also carried out under the same condition. Prior to each photocatalytic degradation experiments, dark adsorption saturation and photolysis effect experiment is vital to evaluate photocatalytic activity accurately. As shown in Fig. 9 a, the rate of adsorption of PPy was 5.2 % after 3 h, however, the adsorption capacity of g-C3N4 and P25 were 1% and 2.1 %, respectively. The high adsorption capacity of PPy is originated from its sizeable \u03c0 electronic delocalization system and strong \u03c0\u2212\u03c0\u2217 interactions. The inset shows the photolysis effect of MO under full spectrum irradiation for 3 h, which indicated that MO is very stable and resistant to photodegradation. Fig. 9b shows the MO photodegradation efficiency of PPy, g-C3N4 and P25 under full spectrum irradiation. It totally showed that the photodegradation of PPy was 42 % after 5 h under full spectrum irradiation, which exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency (g-C3N4 and P25 are only 18 % and 13 %, respectively). Moreover, the pseudo-first-order kinetics is considered as a most suitable exponent to evaluate the photocatalysis reaction rate [], which is expressed as follows: lnCtC0=-kt where Ct and C0 are concentration of MO at time t and t = 0, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9c, the calculated pseudo-first-order rate constants of PPy, g-C3N4 and P25 were 0.09824, 0.03368 and 0.02328, respectively. The rate constant of PPy was 2.91 and 4.21 folds higher than that of g-C3N4 and P25, respectively. Above results confirm a best photocatalytic activity under full spectrum irradiation for PPy compared with P25 and g-C3N4. The low photodegradation rate of P25 resulted from its large band gap, which cannot form photogenerated electron hole pairs under lower visible light energy (Table 3 ). Pure g-C3N4 has lower band gap (2.75 eV) and possesses substantial visible light absorption, however, its photogenerated carrier pairs recombine rapidly caused deficient charge separation and inferior charge mobility, which lead to low photodegradation performance. PPy can utilize entire solar radiation energy for its full spectrum light absorption, thereby possesses execllent photodegradation performance. Interestingly, the LUMO of PPy is -0.74 V vs NHE, which. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "is less negative than that of g-C3N4 (-1.14 V vs NHE). This result theoretically signifies that charge transfer from the PPy polaron to the reducing species such as hydrogen cations is more inefficient than that from the g-C3N4 polaron to reduction state. Therefore, we speculate that the origin of the higher photodegradation performance of PPy is not thermodynamic driving force, but originates from kinetic because of its efficient charge transfer. Besides, the coplanar geometry structure of PPy can increase the delocalization level to stabilize the radical generated by single electron transfer (polaron) or two-electron transfer (bipolaron), thereby enhancing charge transfer efficiency and photocatalysis activity []. Furthermore, cycle stability is an indispensable evaluation indexes in practical application. Therefore, the cycle stability of the PPy photocatalyst is evaluated. As shown in Fig. 9d, the photocatalysis efficiency of PPy photocatalyst only showed a slight decrease after five times cycling. The slight decrease is originated from the inevitable loss in recovery process, such as centrifugation and washing before its reuse. Besides, XRD pattern, FT-IR spectra and microscopic morphology of PPy before and after 5 cycles were compared to verify its recoverability. As shown in Fig. 10a\u2013d, there is no significant difference before and after the test. Therefore, the structure of PPy photocatalyst is very stable and the physicochemical properties does not change during photodegradation. Furthermore, photocatalytic efficiency of PPy under visible light and UV was conducted by photodegradation of MO to verify the universality in different conditions. As is shown in Fig. 11 a, PPy showed the highest degradation rates than g-C3N4 and P25 after 5 h under visible light irradiation, which was up to 41 %. But for g-C3N4 and P25, the photodegradation rates were only 17 % and 11 % after 5 h. Meanwhile, Fig. 11b showed that the photodegradation of MO can be described by a pseudo first-order reaction. The reaction rate constants of PPy under visible light was 2.967 and 5.387 folds compared to g-C3N4 and P25, respectively. The highest photocatalytic rate constants (0.10225 h\u22121) in photodegradation of MO for PPy benefits from the appropriate band gap value and optimal light absorption. However, the rate constants of g-C3N4 and P25 were 0.03446 and 0.01898, respectively. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of PPy and g-C3N4 was lower than TiO2 under ultraviolet light (Fig. 11c), the degradation efficiency for PPy, g-C3N4 and TiO2 were 51 %, 18 % and 99 % after 5 h, respectively. The rate constants values of three photocatalysts were 0.12968, 0.03458 and 0.71766, respectively (Fig. 11d). The reason why the photodegradation rate under UV of P25 higher than other two photocatalysts are as followed. On one hand, as discussed in optical absorption analysis, pure UV owns the highest energy in three in different light sources (UV, visible light and full spectrum light). Serving as a UV light active photocatalyst, P25 can only excite electrons from VB to CB when absorbs more energy from UV region because its large band gap (3.12 eV). On the other hand, P25 possess much more negative CB energy level (-0.24 V vs NHE) than the reduction potential of oxygen (-0.046 V vs NHE) (Fig. S5), therefore, excited electrons in P25 CB can react with adsorbed oxygen on its surface to generate strong oxidized species (O2 \u2212 and OH). Nevertheless, for PPy and g-C3N4, their HOMO energy levels are less positive (1.38 V and 1.61vs NHE), so neither of their holes can oxidize H2O (2.68 V vs NHE) or \u2013OH (1.99 V vs NHE). However, the P25 VB is 2.88 V vs NHE, which is more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O and \u2013OH. Thus, the VB holes can form OH which is a strong oxidant and can react with most organic pollutants. Therefore, in UV system, P25 can excite more photogenerated carriers to form strong oxidizing OH, while PPy and g-C3N4 only oxidize the contaminants by VB holes directly. For all that, PPy also exhibits substantial photodegradation performance under UV which illustrates its excellent photocatalytic activity in different environmental conditions and its potential applications for wastewater treatment and other photocatalytic process. To evaluate the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of as-synthesised PPy towards different organic pollutants, photodegradation tests towards Rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) were conducted, the results are shown in Fig. 12 . Under 6 h full spectrum irradiation, because RhB and MB are easier to decompose under light than MO, so the degradation efficiency is higher than MO and photodegradation rates of RhB and MB were 95.6 % and 86.4 %, respectively. Therefore, PPy exhibits effective photocatalytic performance towards different organic pollutants which can be applicable for photocatalytic degradation of common pollutant. According to the above mentioned degradation investigation, PPy exhibited superior photoactivity under different light sources. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) was conducted to understand the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs for three different photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 13 a, the PL peak intensity order is PPy < P25 < g-C3N4, which indicate that the PPy possesses lowest recombination efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Due to the coplanar geometry structure of PPy, electrons can be stabilized in the highly \u03c0-\u03c0* delocalized system of polymer long chain, which prevent the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and increase the quantum efficiency in photocatalytic process. This result further confirm that PPy possesses excellent photocatalysis activity. In order to understand the internal resistance of the charge transportation process in photodegradation behavior, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted respectively. As shown in Fig. 13b, PPy shows the lowest impedance arc [,], which illustrate the fast charge transfer in photocatalysis process due to its coplanar geometry structure and highly \u03c0-\u03c0* delocalized system. On the contrary, g-C3N4 and P25 show greater internal resistance, resulting in poor charge transfer efficiency. This result validate that PPy has the highest efficiency for charge separation and electron transfer compared to g-C3N4 and P25. The free radical trap experiments were carried out by using different scavengers to investigate the main active radical in the photocatalytic oxidation process for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "PPy, which is useful for deriving the charge transmission route. When the absorbed photon energy equal or greater than to its band gap, PPy can induce the excited electrons transfer from HOMO to LUMO because of the highly delocalized \u03c0\u2010\u03c0* conjugate delocalized structure. Meanwhile, leaves holes (h+) on the HOMO and electrons (e\u2212) on the LUMO to form VB and CB, respectively. These carriers can react with the adsorbed oxygen and other species on the surface of potocatalyst to generate a series of active species such as O2 \u2212 and OH. The possible reactions are shown as follows, O2+e-\u2192\u2219O2- \u2219O2-+2H++e-\u2192H2O2+e- H2O2+\u2219O2-\u2192OH-+\u2219OH+O2 \u2219O2-+h++\u2219OH+contaminants\u2192degradedormineralizedproducts In this reaction process, we speculated that e\u2212, h+, O2 \u2212 and OH play an important role for photodegradation behavior. Therefore, free radical capture experiments were conducted by using different quenchers to study the influence of radical for MO photodegradation (Fig. 13c). The photodegradation efficiency of MO is decreased from 42 % to 11 % in the presence of CuSO4 under simulated solar irradiation. Cu2+ reacts with e\u2212 to form Cu+ and competes with reaction (1) and (2), which reduces the content of O2 \u2212 and OH [,]. So the photodegradation rate decrease. 2-propanol quenches the hydroxyl radicals (OH) and holes (h+) to compete with reaction 4 and 5. However, the MO photodegradation rate maintains about 40 %, which illustrate that OH and h+ are not the main active species. Moreover, when benzoquinone (O2 \u2212 radical scavengers) is added to the reaction system, the degradation rate of MO is also reduced to 18 %. Combined with the above discussion, O2 \u2212 are the main active species for the photodegradation of MO. At the beginning of main oxidation reaction, e\u2212 plays a vital role in the whole photocatalysis reaction. Thus, it is necessary to discuss the influence of excess electrons for photocatalysis rate. Fig. 13d shows the photodegradation rate of MO upon addition of different concentration of Cu2+. The result shows that Cu2+ can cause a decrease of O2 \u2212, and the photocatalytic efficiency decreased with increasing Cu2+ concentration. On the basis of the analysis above, the possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed which was shown in Fig. 14 . When PPy is irradiated by different light, the electrons (e\u2212) with strong reducibility in HOMO will be stimulated to the LUMO leaving strong oxidizing holes (h+). Owing to delocalized existence of \u03c0 electrons resulting in the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Some electrons migrate to the catalyst surface to react with oxygen molecules adsorbed on the surface and form free radicals (O2 \u2212, OH, etc.), which will react with organic contaminant to form a series of smaller molecules due to their strong redox ability. Besides, the h+ in HOMO will oxidize pollutants directly into small molecules for degradation. Therefore, with the efforts of electrons and holes, organic pollutants can be effectively removed under illumination.  In summary, we designed an all-organic conjugated polymer photocatalyst-PPy with high photodegradation efficiency via one-step low temperature polymerization. Due to the low polymerization temperature, PPy mainly forms \u03c0-conjugated structure through \u03b1-\u03b1 connection, which is significantly enhance the photongenerated carriers separation and its application in photocatalysis. Importantly, we present here the first demonstration of the electronic structure and photocatalysis mechanism via theoretical calculation and other characters. The free radical trap experiments confirmed that O2 \u2212 are the main active species for the photodegradation. Besides, PPy exhibits strong light-harvesting capacity in full spectrum regions compared with typical P25 and g-C3N4. Furthermore, PPy can degrade different organic pollutants efficiently under different illumination with high reusability. Thus, PPy is a potential novel organic photocatalyst with appropriate energy levels (-0.74V\u223c1.38 V). The systematic study of photocatalysis mechanism obviously provide theoretical guidance for designing new organic photocatalysts and open an application prospect of using conjugated polymer to solve the energy and environment issues.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Global warming and increase of the greenhouse effect becomes a serious human concerned [1,2]. Global warming becomes a more serious issue by increasing demand for energy. Researchers predicted that in the year 2050, global dictate for energy requirement would be double because of the growing community and manufacture [3]. Using renewable energies instead of fossil fuels are a possible solution. Solar energy is a charity of universe that makes the earth a living planet. A photovoltaic system is a promising way to use solar energy and produce energy [4,5]. Micheal Gratzel and Brian O\u2019Regan for the first time in the year 1991, fabricated device called Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSCCs) to convert sunlight to electricity [6]. However, device size, the production cost, repeatability, stability, and its yield are not enough to consider it as a sustainable technology to provide energy in future [3,7,8]. Moreover, three main strategies were reported to boost the efficiency of DSCCs: 1. Increases the absorption of sunlight by using dopant and/or co-sensitizer [9\u201311]. 2. Increases charge separation by using nanocomposite of metal oxide such as Al2O3/TiO2 [12], NiO/TiO2 [13], ZnO/Al2O3 [14], TiO2/ZnO [15], ZnO/SnO2 [16]. 3. Increases light harvesting by using plasmonic material such as Ag and Au [17,18]. Among the above mentioned strategies, applying metal oxides nanocomposites has the largest impact. The main reason is photo-generated electron-hole recombination can be reduced by using heterojunction structures. There are many promising advantages for Nanocomposite materials for instant simple fabrication process and low construction price [19]. In this regards, researchers work hard to find the best mixture of the nanomaterials for boosting the different parameters such as VOC, JSC, and efficiency of DSSCs using nanocomposite materials. For an instant, Seong-Bum Kim et al. reported GR/TiO2 showed 22% enhancement in PCE of DSSCs compared to control device [20]. In the other work, Rui Tang et al. reported maximal photocurrent and PCE for MOFs/TiO2 composite are increased by 1.93 and 2.21 times in compare to the device containing the bare TiO2 [21]. The present work focused on the synthesis of GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 nanocomposite and applies it in DSSCS. Sb2S3 with an energy band gap of ~1.5\u20132.5\u00a0eV is one of the most talented applicants to prepare nanocomposite because of outstanding optical and electronic properties. Different synthesis methods such as microwave synthesis [22], wet chemical method [23] crystallization of amorphous colloidal microspheres [24], and hydrothermal process [25\u201327] were applied to prepare Sb2S3 with different morphologies. Recently, researchers demonstrate TiO2 and Sb2S3 could form a promising junction which Sb2S3 could pump electrons to the conduction band of TiO2. For example, Meng Sun and co-workers show the photovoltaic properties of TiO2 increased significantly by coupling it with Sb2S3 [28]. They illustrated this happen because photo-generated electrons in Sb2S3 could transfer to the conduction band of TiO2. J. Zhong and coworkers explore TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT solar cells, which show much better performance compared to a reference cell [29]. They declare the modified Sb2S3 shows better optical and electrical properties. Here we first prepared GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 nanocomposite by simple Sonochemical route. In a typical sonochemistry method, an energy arises from acoustic cavitation could be used as activation energy to drive a chemical reaction. The formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid arise temperature to about 5000\u00a0K. This energy helps to form our products [30\u201332]. Then, we used as-prepared GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 nanocomposite to boost the efficiency of DSSCS. We used TiO2/GQDs, Sb2S3, Sb2S3/GQDs, and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 nanocomposite inside the cells. PCE increased by 43% by using TiO2/Sb2S3/GQDs nanocomposite inside the cell. A device containing GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 inside the cell and GQDs outside show 72% improvement in PCE compare to the reference cell. In addition, DFT was used to better understand the charge transfer in the prepared composite.  We prepared graphene quantum dots according to our previous works [5,33,34]. In this regard, mixture of SbCl3 (0.25\u00a0g) and GQDs (30\u00a0mL of 0.045\u00a0M) was prepared under stirring for 10\u00a0min. Afterward, we added 30\u00a0mL of glycol to above solution. Then the prepared solution, 0.2\u00a0g of sulfur powder and 0.3\u00a0g of NaBH4 introduced into an autoclave and kept in oven at 180\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0h. In the end, the resulting products washed with distilled water and ethanol three times. TO prepare GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 composite, 2\u00a0mL Tetraethyl Orthotitanate (TEOT) was dissolved in 5\u00a0mL ethanol. Then the above solution was injected drop wise into the solution of 0.2\u00a0mL acetic acid and Sb2S3/GQDs composite under ultrasonic waves with 60\u00a0W/cm2 intensity and 18\u00a0kHz frequency for 2. The obtained products were dried at 40\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. First, FTO sheets were rinsed by aid of mixture of a detergent solution, followed by washing with ethanol and acetone for 30\u00a0min. TiO2 paste was deposited on cleaned FTO by doctor-blading to devise photoanode. As prepared photo anodes were immersed into dye solution and reserved at 48\u00a0\u00b0C for 24. Counter electrode made by coating platinum on FTO glass. Sb2S3, TiO2/GQDs, Sb2S3/GQDs, and Sb2S3/GQDs/TiO2 (S-G-T) devices were manufactured by dropped their suspensions on photoanode. In the second part, we used procedure reported in our previous work with some modification to fabricate devices with S-G-T sensitizer [5]. In the case of modified cell including GQDs as a down conversion material, the GQDs solution dropped on the piece of mirror and dried in oven. Then it was stuck on the top of cell by using glue. In the bottom of cell, mirror (2) with an aperture was used to reflex those photons comes from the mirror (1). In this Calculations we used a GQDs consisting of a 25 carbon atoms graphene core, terminated by hydrogen and functionalized by carboxylic acid group, hydroxyl group and amine group. Also the calculations were done for 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 supercell of the TiO2 (1\u00a00\u00a01) surface orientation including 64 oxygen and 32 titanium atoms, and the lattice constant is equal to a\u00a0=\u00a0b\u00a0=\u00a03.77\u00a0\u00c5 and c\u00a0=\u00a09.48\u00a0\u00c5. In addition we use an antimony sulfide molecule containing 2 antimony and 3 sulfides. The vacuum depth was up to 20\u00a0\u00c5 for three models. All geometry optimizations and electronic properties were. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "performed using DFT method in DMol3 package [35,36]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the exchange correlation functional Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was picked out [37]. For dispersive intermolecular interactions and long-range van der Walls forces, the DFT-D method within the Grimme scheme is used in all the calculations [38]. We applied the double numerical basis plus polarization (DNP) basis set [39], which has been widely used in the fields of physics and materials science [37,39]. The optimization of the all structures were carryed out by using Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01. The energy tolerance accuracy, maximum force, displacement and global orbital cut-off radius were selected as 10\u22125 Ha, 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 Ha \u00c5\u22121, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 \u00c5, and 5.0 \u00c5, respectively. To better understand the mechanism of charge transfer, we used the Mulliken charge analysis method. The strength of interactions can be characterized by the binding energy, defined as follows: Eb=Ecomplex-Eadsorbate+Eadsorbent, In this definition, Eadsorbate and Eadsorbent are the total energy of adsorbate (GQD or Sb2S3) and adsorbent (TiO2), respectively. Ecomplex in this equation refers to the total energy of the adsorbate/adsorbent complex.  As-synthsized GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 nanocomposite was used as photoanode inside the cell. We studied the effect of using GQDs, Sb2S3, TiO2/GQDs, and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 on the performance of DSSCs. XRD pattern of TiO2, TiO2/GQDs, Sb2S3/GQDs, and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 are illustrated in Fig. 1 . XRD pattern for TiO2 indicates that TiO2 has an amorphous phase (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b demonstrates the XRD pattern of TiO2/GQDs. As we showed in our previous report, GQDs show a broad peak at 2theta\u00a0=\u00a023 [38\u201353]. Therefore we observed overlap in the XRD of TiO2 and TiO2/GQDs. As can be seen in Fig. 1c, XRD pattern of Sb2S3 displays well agreement with JCPDS 06-0474. Fig. 1d illustrates the XRD pattern for GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 nanocomposite. This XRD pattern approves the presence of TiO2, GQDs, and Sb2S3. It shows TiO2 was crystallized in anatase phase (JCPDS 71-1169). Related EDX results are presented in Fig. 2 a-d. According to Fig. 2a, sample is containing Ti and O. Fig. 2b shows the presence of Ti, O, and C which is related to TiO2/GQDs. Also Fig. 2c approves the presence of Sb and S could be assigned to Sb2S3. As can be seen in Fig. 2d, sample is containing Ti, O, C, Sb, and S. The morphology of TiO2, GQDs, TiO2/GQDs, Sb2S3, Sb2S3/GQDs, and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 were discovered by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Results could be found in Fig. 3 a-f. Based on these results, TiO2 was formed in a spherical shape with a uniform size of 20\u00a0nm (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows the SEM images for graphene nanosheets. As seen in Fig. 3c, very small particles were formed when GQDs was used during the synthesis of TiO2. It seems GQDs act as a capping agent and controlled the size. SEM image in Fig. 3d shows that nanoribbons Sb2S3 were formed. It seems Sb2S3 keeps it morphology by using GQDs during its preparation (Fig. 3e). According to Fig. 3f, TiO2 particles aggregated around the Sb2S3/GQDs nanoribbons and formed large plates. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images for GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 composite. TEM images indicate the presence of 3 species. Rods like strictures could be assigned to Sb2S3. Dark dots with an average size of 10\u00a0nm represent TiO2 nanoparticles. Finally, bright particles and sheets show the QGDs and graphene sheets. The effects of Ti and Sb based composite on the performance of as prepared devices studied by applying them inside the cells. Results are presented in Fig. 5 a-c and Table 1 . As can be seen from Fig. 5 and Table 1, average PCE of 5.6% was achieved when TiO2/GQDs was used inside the cell. By replacing TiO2/GQDs with Sb2S3, PCE decreased to 5.75%. Using Sb2S3/GQDs inside the cell increases PCE to 5.75%. In this case, JSC increased compare to the cell containing Sb2S3. Interestingly, using GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 inside the cell dramatically improved PCE and JSC. PCE and JSC boosted to 7.13% and 21.63\u00a0mA/cm2, respectively. According to our previous paper [5], applying GQDs outside of cell could improve efficiency. Therefore, we used GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 inside cell and GQDs outside the cell at the same time to achieve more enhancements in the efficiency. Related results are summarized in Fig. 6 . Based on the results, a device containing GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 inside the cell and GQDs on the mirror (1) show 72% improvement in PCE compare to the reference cell. As can be seen in Fig. 6b and c, a light comes to the inside the cell from aperture. Some of these photons have absorbed by N719 and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2. Other photons which most of them are UV photons go through the cell and reached to the GQDs coated on mirror (1) outside of the cells. Most of these photons have high energies. These photons have absorbed by GQDs and converted to the lower energy photons with a wavelength in visible range spectrum. Mirror (1, 2) reflect the photons to inside the cells. These architecture help light harvesting inside the cell. Density functional theory (DFT) simulation was performed to qualitatively support our experimental observations to present theoretical intuition for the interactions of GQDs/TiO2 and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 through the analysis of the electronic structure. The optimized structures of TiO2, GQDs and GQDs/TiO2 were shown in Fig. 7 . The results demonstrate that between GQDs, and TiO2 there is high binding energy (Eb) (\u22123.11\u00a0eV). The electronic structures of TiO2, GQDs and GQDs/TiO2 are investigated. For this purpose, band structure calculations of TiO2, GQDs, and GQDs/TiO2 were carried out to understand the position and nature of the new electronic levels. Our DFT calculations show the band gap about 2.59\u00a0eV (Fig. 8 a) for TiO2, which is smaller than the experimental value (3.20\u00a0eV). This value is underestimated by 0.65\u00a0eV relative to the experimental, due to the well-known self-interaction problem of GGA functional, including PBE used here [40,41]. For the GQDs and GQDs/TiO2, the band gaps are calculated to be about 2.17 and 0.91\u00a0eV (Fig. 8b and c), respectively. The band gap of the GQDs/TiO2 is much less than TiO2, result in. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the electronic transition from valence bands to conduction bands in GQDs/TiO2 is easier than TiO2 and denotes that the excitation needs less energy. Therefore, the separation of electron and hole in GQDs/TiO2 is easier than that of TiO2, which shows the photocatalytic performance of GQDs/TiO2 is stronger than that of TiO2 [35]. It causes a redshift for the absorption edge to longer wavelength region. Fig. 9 shows the PDOS analysis for the charge carrier migration between GQDs and TiO2. It can be observed that the valence band of TiO2 is mainly composed of O 2p orbitals with a small contribution from Ti 3d states, the whiles conduction band is mainly contributed by Ti 3d states (Fig. 9a). The valence band of GQDs clearly shows hybridization between C 2p, O 2p, and N 2p orbitals and participates in the conduction band, slightly (Fig. 9b). Fig. 9c shows that the bonding states between \u221210 and \u22121.5\u00a0eV has mainly consisted of C 2p, O 2p, N 2p, O 2p, and Ti 3d orbitals. The results also show that bands at the Fermi level were dominated by C 2p and O 2p states, while the contribution from Ti 3d state could be insignificant. There is an overlap between C 2p and Ti 3d orbitals in the conduction band. As a result in GQDs/TiO2, the photoexcited electron on GQDs, particularly in the C 2p state can be transferred to the Ti 3d orbitals at the conduction band and improved photocatalytic efficiency. To investigate the charge interaction between GQDs/TiO2, the total electron density distribution diagram for the GQDs/TiO2 with a value of 0.01 e/\u00c53 has been shown in Fig. 10 . Charge accumulation in the space was demonstrated by blue is surface. This figure displays that many electrons are accumulated in the region between the central part and edge of the GQDs/TiO2 surface. Also, it shows notable charge interactions between GQDs and TiO2. In another section of DFT calculations, the electronic structure of Sb2S3/GQDs/TiO2 was analyzed. For this purpose, first Sb2S3 was placed on the GQDs/TiO2 (S-G-T) and in another case, it was placed between GQDs and TiO2 (G-S-T). Optimized structures are shown in Fig. 11 . The results show that G-S-T is more stable than S-G-T and Eb of G-S-T is more negative than S-G-T (Eb G-S-T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.96 and Eb S-G-T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.23\u00a0eV). The band gap of the G-S-T is about 0.78\u00a0eV that is less than of TiO2 and GQDs/TiO2, result in the electronic transition from the valence band to the conduction band in G-S-T is easier than that of TiO2 and GQDs/TiO2. So, excitation needs less energy (Fig. 12 ). As a result, the photocatalytic performance of G-S-T is stronger than that of TiO2 and GQDs/TiO2. Fig. 13 shows the PDOS analysis of G-S-T. The valence band of GQDs clearly shows hybridization between 2p orbitals and very small contributed in the conduction band (Fig. 13a) and also the valence band of TiO2 is mainly composed of O 2p orbitals and the conduction band is mainly contributed by Ti 3d orbitals (Fig. 13c). The valence band of Sb2S3 is mainly composed of hybridization between s and p orbitals with a small contribution from Sb 4d states, while conduction band is mainly contributed by p states (Fig. 13b). There is an overlap between p orbital of C, O, Sb and S and 3d orbitals of Ti atoms in the conduction band. As a result in G-S-T, the photoexcited electron on GQDs and Sb2S3 particularly in the p state can be transferred to the Ti 3d orbitals at the conduction band that improves photocatalytic efficiency. Fig. 14 shows the electron depletion region mainly locates between Sb2S3 and TiO2. As well as, the electron accumulation region is mainly above the Sb, S, O and Ti atoms. Consequently, in the presence of Sb2S3 between GQDs and TiO2 is a stronger interaction occurs. In sum, the evidence suggests that it is easier to transfer electrons in the presence of Sb2S3, so charge transfer at the G-S-T is stronger. The results of Mulliken charge analysis show that charges of C, Sb, S, O and Ti at the optimized G-S-T are 0.030, 0.387, \u22120.265, \u22120.941 and 1.010 e, respectively which are different from the charges of 0.038, 0.401, \u22120.270, \u22120.934 and 1.330 e before chemisorption, indicating notable charge transfer at the G-S-T.  Sb2S3, TiO2/GQDs, Sb2S3/GQDs, and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 were prepared by a simple hydrothermal and sonochemistry method. These as-prepared nanomaterials were used inside the cell to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. The obtained results show a dramatically improvement in the performance of solar cells by using GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2. Using GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 boosts the efficiency by 43% compared to the reference devices. In the next step, both GQDs and GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 were used outside and inside cells, respectively. This strategy boost efficiency by 72% compares to the reference device. Density functional theory was employed to better understanding the charge transfer in GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2. The electronic structure of GQDs/Sb2S3/TiO2 was analyzed. For this purpose, first Sb2S3 was placed on the GQDs/TiO2 (S-G-T) and in another case, it was placed between GQDs and TiO2 (G-S-T). The results show that G-S-T is more stable than S-G-T and Eb of G-S-T is more negative than S-G-T (Eb G-S-T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.96 and Eb S-G-T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.23\u00a0eV). The band gap of the G-S-T is about 0.78\u00a0eV that is less than of TiO2 and GQDs/TiO2, result in the electronic transition from the valence band to the conduction band in G-S-T is easier than that of TiO2 and GQDs/TiO2. So, excitation needs less energy. As a result, the photocatalytic performance of G-S-T is stronger than that of TiO2 and GQDs/TiO2.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2023.156341.txt", "paper": ["Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is a promising ultra-wide bandgap (4.8\u20135.0\u00a0eV) semiconductor with a broad range of optoelectronic applications, especially in high power electronic devices and solar-blind ultraviolet photodetectors [1,2]. Numerous theoretical and experimental works have been reported on the growth, optoelectronic properties and device applications of Ga2O3 based materials in the past decade [3\u201317]. Ga2O3 has at least five different polymorphs (i.e., \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4), with the monoclinic \u03b2-Ga2O3 the thermodynamically stable phase [1]. Ga2O3 thin films have been epitaxially grown by a number of techniques including MBE, PLD and HVPE, etc. [5,7,8], while their electron concentration (N) can be manipulated by intentional donor doping with Si, Sn, and Ge up to N\u00a0\u223c\u00a01020 cm\u22123 [7,10,18,5]. Owing to its ultra-wide bandgap as well as the high electron mobility (up to\u00a0\u223c200 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121), Ga2O3 exhibits a high breakdown strength of\u00a0\u223c8 MV/cm and low on-resistance, making the Baliga\u2019s Figure of Merit of Ga2O3 superior to other competing wide bandgap semiconductors (e.g., SiC and GaN). For the Ga2O3 based power devices, different structures have been adopted, e.g., unipolar Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) [19], unipolar Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) [20,21], and p-n heterojunction based field-effect transistors/diodes [17,22]. The record average breakdown strength for the present Ga2O3 based power device is\u00a0\u223c5.5 MV/cm, well below the theoretical limit of \u03b2-Ga2O3, which can be mainly attributed to the lack of reliable p-type \u03b2-Ga2O3. To overcome this obstacle, p-n heterojunctions involving n-type \u03b2-Ga2O3 and p-type metal oxides, such as SnO, Cu2O or NiO were fabricated [2,17]. However, these typical binary p-type oxides present several drawbacks which would hinder their practical applications. For instance, Cu2O and SnO show relatively small bandgap (E g\u00a0<\u00a03\u00a0eV) and insufficient chemical stability (e.g., easy formation of CuO and SnO2, respectively) [23,24], while the commonly used NiO exhibits rather low hole mobility (<\u223c0.1 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) and unstable electrical properties [25,26]. Therefore, the realization of p-type Ga2O3 based materials is greatly desired to fully utilize the potentials of Ga2O3. However, like many other wide bandgap oxide semiconductors (e.g., ZnO, In2O3), p-type doping in Ga2O3 is challenging due to its O 2p derived highly localized valence band maximum (VBM) with very low energy position (\u223c9 eV below vacuum). Consequently, it has a large hole effective mass and most acceptor species are deep in the gap (>1 eV above VBM). Density function theory (DFT) calculations showed that typical acceptors (e.g., Zn, Li, and Mg) incorporated at the Ga sites have ionization energies\u00a0>1\u00a0eV [13], while the free holes in Ga2O3 are observed to be easily self-trapped with a trapping energy of\u00a0\u223c0.53\u00a0eV, leading to the spontaneous formation of small polarons [27,28]. Interestingly, there are a few experimental works reporting the observation of p-type conduction in Ga2O3. For instance, Chikoidze et al. claimed the p-type conductivity in Mg doped Ga2O3 as evidenced from multiple techniques including Hall and Seebeck measurements, although the ionization energy of the acceptor level (i.e., MgGa) was found to be\u00a0\u223c1.1\u00a0eV above the VBM [29]. Nevertheless, achieving efficient p-type doping of Ga2O3 is still rather difficult and elusive [1,2]. Valence band engineering through alloying has been employed to design p-type wide bandgap oxides with relatively high VBM energies as well as high valence band (VB) dispersion [30\u201335]. Alloying strategy has also been used to modify the valence band of Ga2O3, aiming to facilitate the p-type doping of wide bandgap Ga2O3 based materials. For instance, Jaquez et al. synthesized the amorphous Ga2(O1\u2212xSx)3 highly mismatched alloy thin films (x\u00a0<\u00a00.35) with a large upward shift (>1 eV) of VB edge [12]. Wei et al. theoretically predicted that \u03b2-(BixGa1\u2212x)2O3 with dilute Bi alloying (i.e., x\u00a0\u223c\u00a01/8) can achieve a low hole effective mass (i.e., \u223c0.74\u00a0m 0) and uplifting the VBM energy by\u00a0>1.6\u00a0eV [15], making it a good candidate for p-type Ga2O3 based alloys. Particularly, ultra-wide bandgap p-type \u03b1\u2013(Ir,Ga)2O3 alloy thin films with high hole concentration (1019\u20131020 cm\u22123) have been obtained recently by Fujita et al. [36]. On the chemical modulation of VB of wide bandgap oxides, it has been demonstrated that the VBM energies and the VB dispersion can be effectively modified by the hybridization with metal orbitals (e.g., Cu 3d) close to the O 2p and more extended orbitals of anions (e.g., S 3p) [37]. In our previous work, we found that Cu2\u2212xS thin film can exhibit high hole concentration (up to 1022 cm\u22123) and high hole mobility (up to\u00a0\u223c6 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) [38]. Therefore, p-type wide bandgap Ga2O3 based materials can be expected by alloying Ga2O3 with Cu2S. In this work, we report on the synthesis of amorphous transparent (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with Cu2S content x<\u223c0.5 at room temperature (RT) by magnetron co-sputtering. We find that the VBM energies as well as the optoelectronic properties of amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys can be manipulated by changing the alloy composition. P-type conductivity is observed for amorphous alloy thin films with x>\u223c0.2. The optoelectronic properties and the electronic structures of these amorphous transparent (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films are investigated in detail by utilizing a variety of analytic techniques. Amorphous oxide semiconductor films have important applications in current optoelectronic devices, e.g., amorphous oxide thin films for transistors [39], amorphous p-type oxide thin film for hole transport layer in solar cells [40]. In particular, the amorphous thin films can be deposited on flexible plastic substrate at low temperature, which is quite appealing for flexible electronics. We believe that our work has significant implication for further studies of p-type Ga2O3 based materials as well as their bipolar device applications.  (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films were grown on glass substrates using a multi-gun RF magnetron sputtering system with separate Ga2O3 and Cu2S targets without intentional substrate heating. Prior to deposition, the chamber was pumped down to\u00a0\u223c7.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 Torr, and the working pressure was maintained at\u00a0\u223c3.7 mTorr by flowing pure Ar during deposition. Alloy composition was controlled by varying the sputtering power of the individual targets. Sputtering power ranges used were 33\u2013100\u00a0W and 0\u201330\u00a0W for Ga2O3 target and Cu2S target, respectively. The film structure was analyzed by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with a grazing incident angle\u00a0\u223c1\u00b0. The. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "microstructure of thin films was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area diffraction (SAD). The electron transparent cross-section lamella was prepared by the focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out technique. The TEM and FIB lift out were conducted on a Thermo Fisher Talos F200X and a Helios 5 UC DualBeam, respectively. Optical properties of (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x thin films were studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) in the spectral range of 0.75\u20135.9\u00a0eV. Electrical properties were investigated by variable temperature Hall effect measurements in the van der Pauw configuration in the temperature range of 80\u2013350\u00a0K. RT Seebeck coefficients were measured using a Linseis Seebeck measurement system (LSR-1). High-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 x-ray source (h\u03bd\u00a0=\u00a01.487\u00a0keV). Photoelectrons were collected and analyzed with a concentric hemispherical analyzer. The Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0in the alloy thin films is the atomic ratio of [Cu]/{[Cu]\u00a0+\u00a0[Ga]} from the XPS measurements. Taking into account the possible composition change during sputtering, the exact atomic ratio between other elements (e.g., [Cu]/[S]) in the deposited alloy thin film might slightly deviate from the molecular formula (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x.  The thicknesses of (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films are in the range of 90\u2013180\u00a0nm. Fig. 1 illustrates the GIXRD spectra of (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x thin films with different Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0ranging from 0 to\u00a0\u223c0.5. As seen, the alloy thin films with x\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u223c0.5 are amorphous. The amorphous nature of these (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x thin films were also confirmed from their corresponding SAD patterns (not shown). In our previous work [38], we found that the Cu2\u2212\u03b4S thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering exhibit different phase structures (i.e., chalcocite Cu2S, djurleite Cu1.94S, digenite Cu1.8S and anilite Cu1.75S), dependent on their corresponding Cu deficient \u03b4. We note that the RT sputter deposited (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x thin films can become crystalline with phase structure of Cu2\u2212\u03b4S as x>\u223c0.9. The optical properties of these alloys were studied using SE. The SE data modeling is based on the three-layer optical model, i.e., the glass substrate, (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin film, and a surface roughness layer. For the (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys, a Tauc-Lorentz oscillator, two Gaussian oscillators and a Drude oscillator were used to describe their dielectric functions, while the surface roughness layer was modeled by using a 50/50% mixture of the alloy and voids. The detailed parameters in these oscillators as well as the data fitting/analysis procedure can be found in the literatures [35,38,41]. In SE measurements, the change in the polarization state of the incident light is described by the eillipsometric \u03a8 (amplitude ratio) and the \u0394 (phase difference), i.e., rp/rs\u00a0=\u00a0tan (\u03a8)exp(i\u0394), with rp and rs the reflectivity for p-polarized light and s-polarized light respectively. These dielectric function models can fit the experimental SE data (\u03a8, \u0394) very well over the whole spectral range. Fig. 2 shows the SE spectra (both measured and fitted values with an angle of incidence of 65\u00b0) for the amorphous (Ga2O3)0.74(Cu2S)0.26 alloy thin film, with a mean square error (MSE) around 2.338. Based on the SE analysis, the dielectric function of alloy thin film, i.e., \u03b5E=\u03b51(E)+i\u03b52(E), can be derived, where the \u03b51(E) and the \u03b52(E) are the Kramers-Kronig transforms of each other. Fig. 3 (a) illustrates the real part of \u03b5 (i.e., \u03b5 1) of (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with different\u00a0x,\u00a0with the corresponding imaginary part of \u03b5 (i.e., \u03b5 2) shown in Fig. 3(b). As seen, the dielectric function of the amorphous alloy changes significantly with the Cu2S content x. For optoelectronic applications, the complex refractive index n=n+ik is also an important parameter describing the optical properties of the material. Here n and k are the refractive index and the extinction coefficient (not shown), respectively, which can be obtained from mathematical conversion of the dielectric function \u03b5. The refractive index n at E\u00a0=\u00a02.8\u00a0eV for these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films are depicted in Fig. 3(c), which can be roughly expressed as a linear function n\u00a0=\u00a01.96\u00a0+\u00a02.53x. Such a linear dependence of refractive index n on the Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0may provide an effective means to evaluate the Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0for amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films. Fig. 4 (a) further plots the calculated transmission spectra based on the refractive index n and the extinction coefficient k obtained from SE for 30-nm thick (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x thin films with different\u00a0x\u00a0on glass substrates. Alloy thin films with relatively small\u00a0x\u00a0(e.g., x\u2264\u223c0.2) exhibit a high transmission in the VIS-NIR spectral range, while films with relatively high\u00a0x\u00a0(e.g., x>\u223c0.26) show substantial optical absorption as well as high reflection in the VIS-NIR spectral range. The distinct absorption in the NIR region (\u03bb\u00a0>\u00a0800\u00a0nm) is caused by the free-hole absorption in the alloy thin film with N\u00a0>\u00a01020 cm\u22123. Fig. 4(b) plots the corresponding absorption coefficient \u03b1 for these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films. As clearly seen, the alloy thin film with x>\u223c0.26 shows distinct free-hole absorption in the NIR region, consistent with their reduced transmission spectrum as observed in Fig. 4(a). Similar to other highly conducting transparent conducting oxides (e.g. doped In2O3 and ZnO) [42,43], the reduced transmission in the NIR region can be attributed to the free-carrier absorption as well as the enhanced reflection because of the relatively high N (>1021 cm\u22123) in these p-type (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films which will be discussed in the following section. The optical bandgap (EGopt) was estimated by extrapolating the (\u03b1h\u03bd)2 versus photon energy plots to the energy intercept. Fig. 4(c) shows the extracted EGopt of alloy thin films as a function of x. It is found that the EGopt decreases from\u00a0\u223c4.8\u00a0eV to\u00a0\u223c2.5\u00a0eV with increasing\u00a0x\u00a0from 0 to 0.5. We note that the EGopt of the amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy with x>\u223c0.26 is very close to that of digenite Cu1.8S or the anilite Cu1.75S [38]. Fig. 5 (a) shows the hole concentration N, mobility \u03bc, and resistivity \u03c1 of these amorphous p-type (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films as a function of Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0in range of 0.2\u20130.5. For comparison, the electrical properties of p-type Cu2\u2212\u03b4S thin film are also given in Fig. 5(a), with \u03b4 being the Cu deficiency. Our previous study demonstrated that the hole concentration N in Cu2\u2212\u03b4S thin film increases from\u00a0\u223c1019 cm\u22123 to 1022 cm\u22123 with increasing \u03b4 from\u00a0\u223c0 to\u00a0\u223c0.25 [38].. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "For alloy thin films with x\u00a0<\u00a00.2, the resistivity is too high (>104 \u03a9 cm) to carry out reliable Hall effect measurements. The nominally undoped RT-deposited Cu2\u2212\u03b4S thin film in this work exhibits N \u2248 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01021 cm\u22123 with \u03bc \u2248 3.3\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, with a mixed phase of chalcocite Cu2S and digenite Cu1.8S. Similar with the Cu2\u2212\u03b4S, the holes in these (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with x\u2265\u223c0.2 are most likely due to the presence of Cu vacancies (V Cu). For (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with x<\u223c0.2, the N is relatively low, which is around 1019 cm\u22123 (e.g., x\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.2), while N drastically increases to\u00a0\u223c2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01021 cm\u22123 as\u00a0x\u00a0increases to 0.26\u20130.5. The hole mobilities of these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films are\u00a0\u223c0.3 cm2V-1s\u22121, with the corresponding resistivities in range of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u20133\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm. The p-type conduction of these typical amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x thin films were further verified by using the RT Seebeck measurements. The Seebeck coefficients for (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with x\u00a0=\u00a00.2, 0.26, 0.5 are\u00a0\u223c228.84\u00a0\u03bcV/K, 107.46\u00a0\u03bcV/K and 106.74\u00a0\u03bcV/K, respectively, indicating that these amorphous alloys are indeed p-type. Based on the obtained optical bandgap (EGopt) as well as the corresponding hole concentration N for these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys, their intrinsic bandgap (EG) can be estimated by taking into account the effects of Burstein-Moss (BM) shift as well as the band gap renormalization (BGR). In contrast to the distinct BM shift as typically observed in those n-type transparent conducting oxides (e.g., ZnO, CdO), the effects of free carrier on the optical bandgap of p-type oxides, sulfide or oxysulfide (e.g., BaSnO3, Cu2\u2212\u03b4S, LaCuOSe) are much smaller or even negligible for a wide range of free hole concentration (N\u00a0<\u00a01022 cm\u22123) [38,44,45], which might be related to their triply degenerated valence bands with high density of states. Therefore, as rough estimates we may take the EGopt of these (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys as their EG (i.e., EG\u00a0\u2248\u00a0EGopt). To better understand the carrier transport in these amorphous p-type alloy thin films, variable temperature Hall measurements were carried out in the temperature range of 80\u2013350\u00a0K. The N of these alloy thin films are nearly temperature-independent because they are highly degenerate with hole concentrations N\u00a0>\u00a01019 cm\u22123. With increasing temperature, the resistivity of these p-type (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films decreases, mainly owing to the enhanced hole mobility. For instance, the \u03bc of (Ga2O3)0.8(Cu2S)0.2 increases from\u00a0\u223c0.3 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 to\u00a0\u223c0.7 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 as the temperature increases from 300\u00a0K to 350\u00a0K, while the corresponding hole concentration N shows negligible change. Analogous with amorphous IGZO thin films, such thermally activated mobility is most likely due to the shallow trap states or the low potential barriers [39]. The carrier transport mechanism was studied by temperature dependent resistivity (\u03c1) or conductivity (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a01/\u03c1). For the carrier transport dominated by the variable-range-hopping (VRH) process, the conductivity \u03c3 can be expressed as \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c30 exp[\u2212(T0/T)1/4] (i.e., ln(\u03c3)\u00a0\u221d\u00a0T\u22121/4), with \u03c30 the extended conductivity, T0 a parameter depending both on the localization length of the wave function and the density of states at the Fermi level [46]. Fig. 5(b) shows ln(\u03c3) vs. T\u22121/4 plots for the amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with x\u00a0=\u00a00.26 and 0.5 and linear dependence can be clearly observed in the temperature range of 120\u2013300\u00a0K. This suggests that the hole transport in these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x is most probably dominated by the variable-range-hopping (VRH) mechanism at relatively low temperatures [46,47]. As mentioned earlier, the current p-type binary oxides (e.g., NiO, Cu2O, SnO) used for fabrication of Ga2O3 based p-n junction power devices suffer from several drawbacks including relatively smaller bandgap, insufficient chemical stability and or rather low hole mobility. Hence, the amorphous p-type (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with a decent hole mobility (\u223c0.3 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) and relatively large bandgap (e.g., 3.4\u00a0eV for alloy with x\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.2) reported in this work provide promising alternatives for the construction of Ga2O3 based p-n quasi-homojunction power devices. The electronic band structure of these (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films are further studied by means of XPS. High-resolution core-level XPS spectra of Ga 2p, Cu 2p, O 1s, S 2p as well as VB spectra were recorded for these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with x\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5. All spectra were recorded after a brief Ar+ sputtering to remove the surface contamination. The binding energies (Eb) are referenced to the C 1s peak at 248.8\u00a0eV. Fig. 6 (a) shows the Ga 2p3/2 spectra of (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with x\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5. As observed, the binding energy for the Ga 2p3/2 is in range of 1118\u20131119.1\u00a0eV for these films, which is within the range of 1117.6\u20131119.8\u00a0eV as reported for amorphous Ga2O3 deposited with different O2 partial pressure in the sputtering gas [48]. Fig. 6(b) plots the Cu 2p 3/2 spectra of these alloy thin films. The E b of Cu 2p3/2 exhibits a monotonic shift (from 933.4 to 932.6\u00a0eV) as the Cu2S content\u00a0x increases. The Cu 2p 3/2 spectra for these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films can be fitted into three peaks, which are attributed to the Cu0 (E b\u00a0\u223c\u00a0932.4\u00a0eV), Cu+ (E b\u00a0\u223c\u00a0932.6\u2013933\u00a0eV) and Cu2+ (E b\u00a0\u223c\u00a0933.3\u2013933.6\u00a0eV), respectively[38]. When fitting the XPS Cu 2p spectra, the energy differences between the two spin\u2013orbit peaks (i.e., Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2) are 19.75\u00a0eV, 19.85\u00a0eV and 19.95\u201320.1\u00a0eV for Cu0, Cu+, and Cu2+ respectively[49], and the area ratio for the corresponding two peaks is 2. The Cu0 signal is most likely due to the Ar+ sputtering process which slightly reduces the alloy and results in the formation of some metallic Cu clusters. With increasing\u00a0x\u00a0in these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy, the [Cu+]/{[Cu+]\u00a0+\u00a0[Cu2+]} ratio increases from\u00a0\u223c23% (x\u00a0=\u00a00.15) to\u00a0\u223c75% (x\u00a0=\u00a00.5). This implies that the valence state of Cu is relatively high in (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys with high Ga2O3 content. It is worth mentioning that the ratio of [Cu+]/{[Cu+]\u00a0+\u00a0[Cu2+]} does not show apparent correlation with the corresponding hole concentration, since the latter is mainly related with the V Cu concentration involved. Fig. 6(c) shows the corresponding O 1s spectra for these alloy thin films, with the E b varying in the range of 531\u2013531.7\u00a0eV. The E b of O 1s for these amorphous Ga-rich (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy is comparable to those previously reported for the amorphous Ga-rich Cd1\u2212xGaxO1+\u03b4. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "alloys [50]. Fig. 6(d) illustrates broad core level peaks (denoted by the black dashed lines) with E b close to that of the S 2p (i.e., in the range of 158\u2013168\u00a0eV). Apparently, these broad peaks can be fitted into three peaks (i.e., A, B and C). Given that the Ga 3\u00a0s has Eb close to\u00a0\u223c161.3\u00a0eV [51,52], the peak A in the XPS spectra may be attributed to the Ga 3\u00a0s. While the other two peaks can be assigned as the S 2p doublet (i.e., S 2p3/2, S 2p1/2). For the data fitting of XPS spectra, a spin\u2013orbit splitting of 1.19\u20131.3\u00a0eV and an S 2p3/2/S 2p1/2 branching ratio of 2 were used for the S 2p doublet. It is observed that the E b of S 2p3/2 for these amorphous alloys are in range of 161.9\u2013162.8\u00a0eV, which is close to that as observed in Cu2\u2212\u03b4S [38,53,54]. The E b of Ga 3\u00a0s for these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys is in the range of 161.2\u2013161.9\u00a0eV, which is comparable to that of Ga 3\u00a0s in other materials (e.g. GaAs, Ga2O3) [51,52]. As expected, the peak intensity of the Ga 3\u00a0s decreases as the Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0increases in the alloys. Be noted that appropriate constraints to the peak width (i.e., full wide at half maximum, FWHM) were also applied in the peak fitting of Fig. 6(b) and (d), with the corresponding FWHW values comparable to those from reported in the literatures [55,56]. It is worth mentioning that both E b and FWHM for a certain core-level peak (e.g., Ga 3s, S 2p3/2 or S 2p1/2) generally exhibits different values for different chemical compounds (e.g., Ga2O3, Ga2S3, Cu2S) [56]. The binding energies and the FWHM values for the different core-level peaks (Cu 2p3/2, Cu 2p1/2, Ga 3s, S 2p3/2, S2p1/2) are observed to be slightly different in these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys with varying Cu2S content x. Fig. 7 (a) plots the VB spectra of amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films with x\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.5. For comparison, the VB spectrum of crystalline Cu2\u2212\u03b4S (i.e., x\u00a0=\u00a01) thin film is also shown. As seen, the VB spectra for these amorphous alloys with x>\u223c0.2 are quite similar with that of Cu2\u2212\u03b4S thin film in the E b range of 0\u20134\u00a0eV, which are mainly attributed to S 3p states and the Cu 3d states [57]. The VBM energies with respect to the Fermi level EF can be extracted from the XPS valence band spectra, i.e., by a linear extrapolation of the leading edge of the VB to zero baseline intensity. It has been demonstrated that the Fermi level of semiconductors at the surface is pinned to a universal energy level, known as the Fermi-level stabilization energy, E FS, located about 4.9\u00a0eV below the vacuum level (E vac) [58]. Since XPS is a surface-sensitive techniques, the VBM measured can be referenced to E FS. Absolute values of VBM with respect to E Vac of III-V, II-VI and oxide semiconductors have been determined using E FS as the reference level [34,35,50,58\u201360]. With using the obtained E G for these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys, the corresponding conduction band minimum (CBM) energies can be estimated as VBM\u00a0+\u00a0E G. In Fig. 7(b), the obtained VBM energies for these alloy thin films are depicted. As seen, the VBM generally shifts upward with increasing Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0in the alloys. It has been theoretically predicted that semiconductors with the conduction band minimum CBM (VBM) <\u223c1eV above (below) EFS can be effectively doped n- (p-) type [61]. For alloys with x>\u223c0.2, the energy difference between the VBM and the E FS is less than\u00a0\u223c0.5\u00a0eV, implying that they can exhibit p-type conductivity. Specifically, the native acceptor defects (e.g., V Cu etc) can be easily formed in these amorphous alloys and their ionization energies are relatively small. Therefore, the free holes in these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films (x\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.2) most likely arise from the prominent formation of shallow acceptors (e.g., V Cu etc) due to their relatively high VBM energy positions. It is worth noting that the VBM energies for the (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys with\u00a0x\u00a0in range of 0.2\u20130.26 are around\u00a0\u223c5.5\u00a0eV (below the E Vac), which is slightly higher than that of solar absorbers (e.g.,MAPbI3, CsPb3\u2212xBrx, PNTB) used in the highly efficient perovskite or organic solar cells [62\u201364]. This suggests that these amorphous p-type transparent (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x thin films may also be employed as promising efficient hole transport materials in these solar cells. For these amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys, it would be interesting to compare their optoelectronic properties with that of their crystalline counterparts. We note that the obtained dielectric function of the amorphous Ga2O3 is close to that of crystalline Ga2O3 film, while the VB of amorphous Ga2O3 is also similar with that of bulk crystalline Ga2O3 [65,66]. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no data for the crystalline (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloys have been reported.  Amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x (x<\u223c0.5) alloy thin films were synthesized by magnetron co-sputtering on glass substrate at RT. The optical properties (e.g., dielectric function \u03b5, optical bandgap EGopt, absorption coefficient \u03b1) of these alloy thin films were investigated by using spectroscopic ellipsometry. As the Cu2S content\u00a0x\u00a0increases in the alloy thin films, the EGopt decreases from\u00a0\u223c4.8\u00a0eV to\u00a0\u223c2.5\u00a0eV. The free hole absorption is notable for these alloy thin films with x>\u223c0.26. The amorphous (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin film exhibits p-type conductivity as x>\u223c0.2. As\u00a0x\u00a0increases from\u00a0\u223c0.2 to\u00a0\u223c0.5, the hole concentration N in the alloy thin films increases from 1019 cm\u22123 to\u00a0\u223c2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01021 cm\u22123, with the hole mobility\u00a0\u223c0.3 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. The hole transport is found to be dominated by the variable-range-hopping mechanism at relatively low temperatures (120\u2013300\u00a0K). The increase in N in films with x>\u223c0.2 is in agreement with the upshift of the VBM by\u00a0\u223c3\u00a0eV as measured by XPS. The higher VBM of the amorphous alloys favors the formation of native shallow acceptors (e.g., V Cu), and hence increases their p-type conductivity. The desirable properties of these amorphous p-type transparent (Ga2O3)1\u2212x(Cu2S)x alloy thin films make them promising materials in Ga2O3 based p-n heterojunction power devices and highly efficient solar cells.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

As the strength of the Raman scattering signal is very weak, high laser excitation power and high concentration are required to enhance the Raman signal. Different versions of Raman scattering techniques like resonance Raman (RR) [4], coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) [5] and SERS can increase the Raman signal significantly. Molecular fingerprint up to single-molecule level can be detected with SERS [6\u201310]. The sole reason behind the enhancement in SERS is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which occurs when surface conduction electrons interact resonantly with the electric field component of the externally incident electromagnetic radiation (such as laser light or evanescent field associated with fast-moving electrons). This LSPR can confine the incident light and power into a sub-nanometer regime, which is called \u201chot spots\u201d [11]. The plasmons are strongly excited on metallic nanostructures, and they are dependent on the shape [12], size [13\u201315], and interparticle distances between them [11]. The incident laser excitation power increases locally in the interparticle gap positions to finally produce a highly intense Raman signal. The molecules adsorbed at these interparticle nanogap hot spots give rise to the majority of the SERS signal [16]. Metal nanostructures dispersed on a substrate with sub-nanometer gap between them are an excellent candidate for enhancing SERS signal. However, it is not easy to fabricate metal nanostructures with a gap of less than 10\u202fnm between them [16]. Various fabrication techniques have been used to fabricate nanogap embedded structures like lithography, shadow evaporation, and vapor depositions techniques [17\u201320]. However, all of these are challenging, expensive and time-consuming. Due to good resistivity against corrosion, thermal stability and most importantly the existence of surface plasmons in the UV-visible region of the EM spectra, Gold (Au) and Silver (Ag) are mostly used for the production of SERS active substrate. They are also used widely to produce efficient catalytic nanoparticles [21,22], and dye-sensitized solar cells [23,24]. Ag is more preferred over Au in the visible region due to its large scattering cross-section compared to extinction cross-section in the visible region [25]. Beside electromagnetic (EM) enhancement, chemical (CM) enhancement also increases the enhancement by charge transfer mechanism when the adsorbed analyte forms complexes with metal molecule [26,27]. Ag nanoparticles embedded in a semiconductor substrate is found to increase absorption [1]. It also shows SERS effect [16,17] due to their strong near field coupling effect. Quite recently, we have shown that for Ag deposited on Si surface having arrays of micro-pyramidal structures, the SERS effect increases immensely [28]. Noble metal/semiconductor structure is a very stable candidate for SERS substrate as semiconductor acts as a support to hold the metal particles and also prevent them from agglomeration. This makes them superior compared to their colloidal counterparts where agglomeration is a significant issue [29]. Many processes have been used to deposit Ag on semiconductor substrates like physical vapor deposition (PVD) [17], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [30] and galvanic displacement reaction (GDR) [28\u201331]. Among these processes, GDR is a very low-cost process, and it also produces a very clean interface due to the absence of any external reducing agent [31,32]. In GDR, the difference in electrostatic potential between the substrate and the metal to be deposited is the driving force behind the deposition. Metal ions are reduced with electrons supplied by virtue of Si half-cell reaction. The electrostatic potential of Ag is 0.8\u202fV whereas for Si it is \u22120.875\u202fV w.r.t standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) which indicates a smooth deposition of Ag on Si in this process. The equation can be written as, Si+6F-\u2192SiF62-+4e-(inthepresenceofHF) Ag++e-\u2192Ag HF is required to remove SiO2 from substrate surface so that continuous metal deposition can be obtained. In this work, we have shown that endotaxial Ag nanoparticles and spherical Ag nanoparticles composite formed on planar Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface when annealed at O2 atmosphere. The substrate hence produced can serve as a good substrate for SERS. We have chosen this system because the oxide growth rate in Ag-Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) system is prolonged compared to Au- Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) and Ag-Si interface is less reactive compared to Au-Si [33]. At room temperature, Si atoms can out-diffuse through several angstrom thick Au layer. This diffusion process results broken Si-Si bonds which makes the system more reactive and prone to oxidation. Ag is observed to form an abrupt metal/semiconductor junction, and the rate of growth of oxidation layer is slow for an Ag-Si system. The formation of endotaxial Ag nanoparticle is observed to be dependent on the deposition time, annealing atmosphere and the nature of the substrate. Detailed structural analysis of these endotaxial structures was carried out by cross-sectional TEM (XTEM). Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation was also implemented in this study to understand the enhancement of the EM field between the gaps of two Ag nanostructures and production of higher SERS enhancement. To the best of our knowledge, no reports on endotaxial growth of silver structures exist using such simple method used in the present study. Fig. 1 shows different steps for the formation of endotaxial Ag - spherical Ag composite structure.  Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) [p-type] substrates were first cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water by ultrasonication for 5\u202fmin. After the initial cleaning, the substrates were cleaned by the RCA method to obtain a native oxide layer on the Si substrates. The substrates were then rinsed with ethanol, DI water and stored in vacuum desiccators until further use. Before Galvanic displacement reaction, the Si wafers were immersed into a solution of 2% HF in DI water for 1\u202fmin and then immediately transferred into a mixture of 5\u202fmM AgNO3 and 4.8\u202fM HF in DI water for 1\u202fmin and 3\u202fmin, respectively to obtain a thin film of Ag on Si. The substrates were then subjected to rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 550\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin with a heating and cooling ramp of 10\u202f\u00b0C per second in both N2 and O2 atmosphere. As this temperature was below the eutectic temperature (836\u202f\u00b0C) of the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Ag-Si system, any intermixing compound formation is forbidden [34]. Henceforth we will use notation S1, and S2 for Ag deposited on Si for 1\u202fmin and 3\u202fmin and annealed in O2 environment at 550\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin, and S3 for Ag deposited on Si for 3\u202fmin and annealed in N2 environment at 550\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin, respectively. Pyramidal Si (P-Si) substrates were produced by saw damage removal (SDR) method where the wafers were first etched into a solution of 30% NaOH and DI water at 70\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fmin. In this step, a few \u03bcm thick layers are etched out from both the sides of the wafers [35]. The substrates were then immersed into a solution of 2% NaOH, 10% IPA and DI water at 75\u202f\u00b0C for 45\u202fmin to obtain pyramidal Si surface. The XRD measurement of the samples was done by Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray system (Rigaku, Smart Lab) at grazing incidence (GIXRD) mode with 0.6\u00b0 incidence angle. X-rays of wavelength 1.5406\u202f\u00c5 (Cu-K\u03b1 radiation) was used for the experiments. Initial characterization was done using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to see the overall morphology and then by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) for extensive structural study. For cross-sectional TEM (XTEM) measurement two cut pieces (3\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f6\u202fmm) of the samples are bonded face to face and then inserted into a brass tube. The brass tubes were then cut into several pieces of 0.5\u202fmm thickness, which were then thinned mechanically followed by double dimpling. Finally, the dimpled pieces were subjected to Ar+ ion milling in a precision ion polishing system at an energy of 3.5\u202fkeV followed by cleaning at 1.5\u202fkeV. The TEM (FEI Tecnai G2 F30-ST) was operated at 300\u202fkeV, and it is also equipped with high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector from Fischione (Model 3000) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attachment for compositional analysis. Rhodamine 6G (R6G) was used as the detection molecule to understand the SERS efficiency of the substrates. The SERS spectra were obtained by using a LABRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer and data were acquired by using Labspec 4 software. The laser excitation source is a He-Ne laser with an excitation wavelength of 632.8\u202fnm. A 100\u00d7 objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.9 was used to focus the laser spot on the sample. The laser power was 100\u202f\u00b5W with beam size 1\u202f\u00b5m\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f\u00b5m. The data were recorded for 10\u202fs integration time and 3 accumulations. The characteristic Raman peak of Si (at 525\u202fcm\u22121) was used to calibrate the spectrometer. NBulk and NSERS, are the number of molecules within the focal volumes and number of molecules presented on the SERS substrate respectively, was determined by considering uniform monolayer deposition of R6G on Si substrate. The UV\u2013Vis spectra of the samples were taken in diffuse reflectance mode using PerkinElmer Lambda spectrophotometer using an integrated sphere. The spectral range of 300\u202fnm to 700\u202fnm was used for the measurement for all the samples. To obtain the near-field intensity distribution and to calculate the SERS enhancement, 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical simulations (from Lumerical Inc, Canada) were performed. For modeling, the coupled Ag nanostructures were laid on planar Si according to TEM observations. The geometry of the substrate and the coupled system is shown in Figure A.7. The variation of the real and imaginary part of the dielectric constants with the wavelength of Ag and Si is also shown in Figure A.8. Total-field scattered-field (TFSF) source with propagation direction along negative z-axis and polarization along x-axis was used to excite the coupled structure. The whole simulation region was set as 600\u202fnm\u202f\u00d7\u202f600\u202fnm\u202f\u00d7\u202f600\u202fnm3 and perfectly matched-layer (PML) boundary conditions were used at all boundaries. 500\u202ffs simulation time was set so that the energy field decays fully. 1.5\u202fnm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.5\u202fnm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fnm mesh size was used for simulation purpose. The excitation wavelength of 632\u202fnm with a span of 100\u202fnm wavelength on both sides was used, and the field monitors were placed at x-z and y-z plane around the coupled structure.  Fig. 2 (a) shows plane view SEM image of Ag nanoparticles deposited on Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) substrate for a deposition time of 1\u202fmin by GDR process. The average size of the particles is 52.99\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.14\u202fnm, and the coverage is 37%. The bird\u2019s eye view image (Fig. 2(b)) shows that the particles are of flat-top shape. Increasing the deposition time leads to increased particle coverage (73%) as shown in Fig. 2(d). It is observed that the particles are initially disconnected to each other, but with increasing deposition time they get extended parallel to substrate surface and form a percolated network (Fig. 2(e)) and particles are remain flat (Fig. 2(f)) for further increase of deposition time. The percolation is known to improve the film\u2019s uniformity [36]. The growth of Ag on Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) is observed to be Stranki-Krastsanov/layer plus island growth mode [37]. The XRD patterns of the prepared substrate are shown in Fig. 3 . The Ag film deposited by GDR process is observed to be polycrystalline in nature and peaks observed corresponds to (1\u202f1\u202f1), (2\u202f0\u202f0) and (2\u202f2\u202f0) interplanar spacing of cubic Ag (space group Fm-3\u202fm, JCPDS card No. 87\u20130597). The additional peaks arise from the Si substrate are shown in Figure A.1. The (1\u202f1\u202f1) peak has largest intensity indicates most of the Ag particles are oriented in that direction and which is energetically favorable as it possesses low surface energy. The highly intense and sharp peaks indicate the formation of highly oriented crystals in the Ag film. Fig. 3(a) shows XRD pattern of Ag according to JCPDS data. Fig. 3(b) shows the same for as-deposited Ag on Si for 1\u202fmin and 3\u202fmin deposition, respectively. The grain size was calculated using Scherrer\u2019s formula [38]. The variation of grain size depending on deposition time and annealing in different atmospheres is listed in Table A.1. It shows an increment in the crystallite size due to increasing deposition time. Fig. 3(c) shows XRD pattern of Ag deposited for 3\u202fmin and 1\u202fmin annealed at O2 and N2 atmosphere, respectively. Where the crystallite size increases due to annealing but the increment is more when annealed at O2 atmosphere compared to N2 atmosphere.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "This fact indicates higher mobility of Ag on Si in O2 atmosphere. Also, no oxidation peak of Ag can be seen from the XRD pattern after annealing. Variation of XRD peaks of Ag nanoparticles deposited on P-Si after annealing is shown in Fig. 3(d) which also shows an increment in the crystallite size. Also, higher crystallite size of Ag on P-Si compared to planar Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) indicates higher growth rate of Ag on P-Si. For Ag deposition of 1\u202fmin on Si (Fig. 4 (a)), the average particle size obtained from different TEM images is 55.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.92\u202fnm, which is consistent with the SEM measurement. The average height of the particle is 57.78\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.05\u202fnm, with an aspect ratio of 0.456. The minimal variation in height indicates electronic growth of Ag on Si, as reported by Gavioli et al. [39]. Fig. 4(b) shows the STEM-HAADF image on which the EDX mapping (Fig. 4(c)) was carried out. It confirms that the particles are Ag and no evidence of particle diffusion into Si substrate is observed in this case. The HRTEM image from the interface (Fig. 4(d)) shows the formation of the Moir\u00e9 pattern due to the overlapping of Si (1\u202f1\u202f1) and Ag (1\u202f1\u202f1) plane. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) image is shown in Fig. 4(e), which shows a slight rotation (~4.16\u00b0) between Si (1\u202f1\u202f1) and Ag (1\u202f1\u202f1) plane. This kind of tilted heteroepitaxy was also observed in our previous experiments and is a unique way to reduce the interfacial strain [11,28]. The inverse FFT (IFFT) image (Fig. 4(f)) shows the formation of epitaxial Ag on Si. Fig. 4(g) shows the magnified image of Fig. 4(a) which gives a clearer view of the particles and shows the uniformity in the height distribution. For 3\u202fmin Ag deposited sample, formation of quasi-continuous layer is observed from XTEM images in Fig. 4(h) and Fig. 4(i). This feature corresponds to the spaghetti-like structure observed in the SEM image (Fig. 2(e)). The aspect ratio, in this case, is 0.32 which indicates that with increasing deposition time, the growth in the lateral direction is faster compared to the perpendicular direction. Also, we have observed that with increasing deposition time the direct contact point of Ag nanoparticles with Si increases. After annealing in O2 atmosphere at 550\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin, the interparticle distances increases for both cases (1\u202fmin and 3\u202fmin Ag deposition) and the particle shape becomes spherical (Fig. 5 (a)). The average size of the sphere is 121.07\u202f\u00b1\u202f26.27\u202fnm and 253.84\u202f\u00b1\u202f56.52\u202fnm for S1 and S2, respectively. This indicates almost two times increment in the height of the particle from the as-deposited condition. The particle density in the annealed sample is also different compared to the as-grown sample indicating agglomeration of Ag during annealing. This occurs due to a phenomenon called \u201cOstwald ripening\u201d in which smaller particles reduced in size and attached to the surfaces of bigger particles to minimize the surface energy and finally obtain a spherical shape [32]. Triangular shaped particles are also seen inside the Si substrate. However, there is a clear variation in the number and size of the triangular particles between S1 and S2 (Fig. 5(a)). Interestingly the insertion length of the endotaxial Ag structure observed is around 60.11\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.74\u202fnm for S1 and 42.34\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.65\u202fnm for S2. Metallic nanoparticles on dielectric substrates are often thermodynamically unstable due to their high surface energy, and this leads to the formation of embedded nanoparticles into the substrate [40]. In this system, the nanoparticles got embedded into SiOx (considering x\u202f=\u202f2 for our case) when the interface energy (\u03c3Ag/SiO2) is less than the exposed Ag (\u03c3Ag). From literature we obtain the surface energy for \u03c3SiO2\u202f=\u202f0.29 Jm\u22122 and \u03c3Ag\u202f=\u202f1.25\u202fJ m\u22122 [40]. The value of \u03c3Ag/SiO2 for S1 and S2 can be obtained from Young\u2019s equation which can be written as \u03c3Ag/SiO2=\u03c3SiO2-\u03c3Agcos\u03b8. The average contact angle for S1 and S2 is obtained as 137.33\u00b0 \u00b1 6.66\u00b0 and 145.52\u00b0 \u00b1 12.59\u00b0 respectively, from different TEM images. From Eq. (2) the value of \u03c3Ag/SiO2 for S1 is obtained as 1.209, which is lower than \u03c3Ag. So, from interface energy consideration, the formation of the embedded nanoparticle is clearly energetically favorable in this case. However, for S2 the value of \u03c3Ag/SiO2 is obtained as 1.35, which is greater than \u03c3Ag. So, it is clear that the contact angle for S1 is lower than S2 which results in a greater number of endotaxial nanoparticle formation in case of S1 compared to S2. Si also tends to diffuse through silver so that the nanoparticle gets completely buried into the substrate and this process is also known to occur at a lower temperature (150\u2013250\u202f\u00b0C) [41]. The buried nanoparticles have an elongated shape parallel to the substrate, and they also show faceted Ag-Si interface. We will describe the detailed structure of the triangular particles letter in the manuscript. Fig. 5(c) is the EDX elemental mapping of the region bounded by the rectangular portion in STEM-HAADF image (Fig. 5(b)). It clearly shows that the triangle inserted into the Si substrate is Ag. Fig. 5(d) shows that there is almost one to one correspondence between the spherical particle and the triangular particles. To form such endotaxial particles a direct contact between Ag and Si is required so that Ag can penetrate through Si, this condition is fulfilled in GDR as there are direct contacts between Si and Ag [Figure A.2]. However, there is also a thin layer of oxide (possibly Si oxide) at the interface to prevent the penetration [Figure A.3]. Such endotaxial structure is not seen when the substrate is annealed at 550\u202f\u00b0C in O2 atmosphere, but in case of RTA, the rapidly increasing temperature rate ruptures the Si oxide layer so that the Ag on the surface can see the Si and penetrate through it while keeping symmetry with the substrate. We did extensive HRTEM analysis to determine the crystalline structure of the endotaxial particles. We selected the thinnest portion of the sample for HRTEM analysis. Fig. 6 (a) shows the HRTEM image of a single endotaxial particle where the different crystallographic directions are shown by the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "arrows. The fast Fourier transformed (FFT) image from region 1 (marked by yellow square) of Fig. 6(a) is shown in Fig. 6(b) which revealed an epitaxial relationship between Si substrate and Ag as follows: Si (\u202f\u22121\u202f1\u202f1)|| Ag (\u202f\u22121\u202f1\u202f1) and Si (1\u20131\u20131)|| Ag (1\u20131\u20131). The FFT image of region 2 (marked by the red square) of Fig. 6(a) shows the same epitaxial relationship. All the FFT patterns are obtained along [1\u202f1\u202f0] zone axis of Si. The initial mismatch between Si and Ag is almost 25%, but they do form an epitaxial interface by domain matching epitaxy (DME) in which a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 domain of Si matches almost exactly with a 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 domain of silver by keeping only 0.2% lattice mismatch along 111 direction [42]. The reduced lattice mismatch and small size of the endotaxial structure allow elastic relaxation of the strain field along the interface [43]. The Ag-Si interface and the buried nanoparticles are almost free of any clustering and defects. Martin et al. also observed the interface of Ag nanocrystal at Si void as free of any structural distortion and they conclude that the small distortions may be averaged out by a large number of Si below the nanoparticles [43]. Fig. 6(d) is the inverse FFT (IFFT) image from Fig. 6(c) and shows dominant epitaxy along [\u22121\u202f1\u202f\u22121] direction. Fig. 6(e) is the IFFT image from Fig. 6(b) shows the dominant epitaxy along [\u202f\u22121\u202f1\u202f1] directions. The particle which we took for the analysis of endotaxial structure is shown in Figure A.4 (a). The view of the unit cell of Ag and Si along 110 zone axis and the corresponding diffraction pattern are obtained from crystal maker software (CrystalMaker Software Ltd, UK). Figure A.4(b) shows the simulated diffraction pattern of Si and Ag along 110 zone axis. The diffraction pattern which we obtained from region 1 of Fig. 6(a) is obtained by rotating the diffraction pattern of Figure A.4(b) clockwise along the x-y plane by 57\u00b0. The crystal structure obtained (Figure A.4(d)) by analyzing is almost similar to the one shown in Figure A.4(a), which shows that the endotaxial particles are bounded by \u2212224 facet on one side and 2\u201324 facet on the other with a 3\u201331 facet connecting them. The upper surfaces are bounded by 2\u201320, \u2212331 and \u221211\u20131 facets, respectively. The STEM-HAADF image of S2 is shown in Fig. 7 (a). The EDX elemental mapping from S2 confirms the penetration of Ag into Si substrate (Fig. 7(b)) but the number and penetration depth is much smaller in this case compared to S1. Fig. 7(c) is the bright-field TEM image of S2. When we annealed the sample at same (550\u202f\u00b0C) temperature in N2 atmosphere, only Ostwald ripening occurs resulting bigger particle formation, but no endotaxial Ag in Si is observed (Fig. 7(d)). Which is confirmed from the EDX elemental mapping (Figure A.5). We have also studied the aging effect of the endotaxial structure. After a lapse of 1\u202fmonth, the sample S1 and S2 were again analyzed by HRTEM to test whether the endotaxial structure remained intact. Fig. 8 (a) shows the bright-field TEM images of S1 (lower side) and S2 (upper side). The average insertion length of the endotaxial particles is 58.84\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.08\u202fnm for S1. A clear deviation from spherical shape is observed in case of surface nanoparticles and for most of the particles in both the cases. The HRTEM image from the endotaxial particles also shows the formation of defects in Si, which was not present initially. The high magnification image (Fig. 8(c)) clearly shows deformed Ag particles at the surface. However, the endotaxial structures remain intact. Formation of SiOx layer on top of every Ag particle is also observed, which is shown by the arrow in Fig. 8(d), which completely surrounds the Ag particles. To confirm, we have taken EDX elemental mapping from the top surfaces of the Ag particles (Fig. 8(f)). The STEM HAADF image also shows the formation of diffuse SiOx on Ag. The EDX elemental mapping taken from the top surfaces confirms the presence of Si and O2 at the surfaces. We have also deposited Ag particles on pre-patterned (pyramidal) Si surfaces and annealed at O2 and N2 environment at 550\u202f\u00b0C. In this case, Ag particles form a percolated network after 1\u202fmin of deposition, as shown in Fig. 9 (a). Fig. 9(b) shows the XSEM view of 1\u202fmin Ag deposited sample on pyramidal Si (P-Si), and it is observed that all the pyramids are covered uniformly with Ag particles. It was observed that the Ag particles are deposited on Si pyramid hetero-epitaxially by keeping a tilt angle at the interface [28]. Fig. 9(c) shows bright-field XTEM view of the O2 annealed sample, and it is observed that triangular-shaped Ag particles are formed along with spherical Ag particles. Interestingly, in this case, the triangular particles do not get embedded into the substrate Si, but they remain side-by-side along the slope of the pyramid which is very much clear from the STEM-HAADF image (Fig. 9(d)). However, in case, of N2 annealed sample only spherical shaped particles were formed. We showed in our previous study that in both cases the particles grow epitaxially on Si (1\u202f1\u202f1) and the facets of the triangular particles are bounded by {4\u202f2\u202f2} planes [28]. From the observations on planar-Si and P-Si, it is clear that triangular particle formation occurs only at O2 atmosphere and not in N2 atmosphere. Adsorbates like O, S can induce faceting [44], step brunching [45], and pitting of metal nanoparticles [46]. Oxygen is known to enhance post-deposition coarsening of Ag, resulting in enhanced island separation [47]. The enhanced kinetics of Ag produces localized stress into Si, resulting Si lattice defects. These localized stress in Si leads to the formation triangular-shaped etch pits which acts as the nucleation center of triangular Ag nanostructures. In the presence of chalcogens (i.e. O, S), metal particles form a cluster with them, which changes the mass transport process. In this case, the transport occurs through M-X cluster instead of single metal atoms. The cluster is also observed. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "to transport freely on dielectric substrate compared to only their metallic counterparts [48]. When annealed at O2 atmosphere, an ad-species of Ag called AgmO forms which have higher mobility on Si compared to Ag. The enhanced mobility of this ad-species is due to its lower detachment barrier on Si compared to Ag atoms. Whenever Ag adatoms hit another Ag atoms, it decomposes, and they prefer to stick to the edge of the islands instead of the top surface. This leads to the formation of triangular-shaped Ag nanostructure. The formation prefers to grow along (1\u202f1\u202f1) direction of P-Si. Co-incidence site epitaxy (CSE) occurs between Ag (1\u202f1\u202f1) and Si (1\u202f1\u202f1) plane leading to minimization of the stress at the interface and the triangular nanoparticle grow along the slope of the pyramid. Ag diffusion through Si occurs via an interstitial-substitutional mechanism which is seen to enhance in the presence of O2 atmosphere. However, Rollert et al. observed that the diffusion is dominated by interstitial substitution in dislocation free Si [49]. On planar Si (1\u202f0\u202f0), the Ag atoms remain initially at thermodynamically unstable configuration due to their high surface energy. When the substrate is annealed at O2 atmosphere the enhanced kinetics of the particles help them to diffuse through Si via interstitial-substitutional mechanism. This leads to the formation of embedded nanostructure in O2 environment. The endotaxial structure also follows\u202f\u30081\u202f1\u202f1\u3009\u202fsymmetry due to the reason mentioned above and, formation of endotaxial Ag occurs due to this treatment. Rhodamine 6G molecule (molecular weight 479.02\u202fg) was used as the probe molecule to measure the SERS enhancement in Ag sphere-endotaxial structure. To measure the enhancement of Raman signal of R6G we used the formula [50], EF=ISERS/IBulk\u00d7NBulk/NSERS where ISERS is the integral intensity of a particular Raman peak of the analyte adsorbed on the sample and IBulk is the same for the analyte alone. NBulk is the number of analyte molecule present in the solution, and NSERS is the number of molecules adsorbed and probed on the SERS substrate [50\u201351]. To prepare the SERS active substrate the substrates were immersed in 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22125 mol R6G solution for 12\u202fh and then dried. R6G solution of concentration 10\u22121 mol was used as reference spectra. The Raman peaks of R6G appear at 612\u202fcm\u22121, 772\u202fcm\u22121, 1182\u202fcm\u22121, 1312\u202fcm\u22121, 1364\u202fcm\u22121 and at 1512\u202fcm\u22121 [51]. The most dominant SERS peak appears at 612\u202fcm\u22121 (corresponds to C-C-C in-plane vibration of R6G molecule) and at 1364\u202fcm\u22121 (corresponds to the aromatic C-C stretching vibration mode), for both S1 and S2 (Fig. 10 ). The SERS spectra were taken from 3 different points from both the substrate to ensure its homogeneity (Fig. 10(a) and (b)). We have observed that the SERS enhancement factor (EF) for S1 is almost 2 to 3 times higher than S2 for almost all the peaks. EF for both the substrates was measured using the equation mentioned above. The EF obtained for different peaks for the two different samples is shown in Table A.2. It is observed that for S1 and S2 the highest EF is obtained for the peak at 612\u202fcm\u22121 and values are (1.48\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.14)\u202f\u00d7\u202f106 and (6.45\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.77)\u202f\u00d7\u202f105, respectively. The EF for 1512\u202fcm\u22121 (5.14\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.19)\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 is also comparable to that. The detailed calculation of EF is shown in the supporting information. Table 1 shows a comparison of SERS EF reported in the literature with our work containing Ag. Fig. 11 shows the UV\u2013visible absorption spectra of the samples made on planar Si substrate. The diffuse reflectance spectra were converted to absorbance using standard Kubelka-Munk method [57]. From Fig. 11(a) it is clear that all the samples have two absorption band in the region 300\u2013700\u202fnm. The first absorption peak at 433\u202fnm is very sharp initially (when Ag coverage is less) but gets slightly broadened due to higher deposition time and annealing. The second absorption peak at 533\u202fnm is much broader than the previous one, and it also gets broadened with higher deposition time and annealing. As this peak is closer to the laser working wavelength of 632.8\u202fnm, it has a significant role behind the SERS enhancement obtained from the substrates. The substrate made on P-Si substrate also shows same kind of feature and is shown in Fig. 11(b). To understand the SERS EF result, we have used 3d finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulation to understand the reason behind the enhancement of different structures. Specially to know, whether embedding of Ag into Si substrate is advantageous or not for SERS enhancement. We have compared the simulation result considering two types of systems, in one system, we consider Ag sphere (60\u202fnm radius) on Si substrate (Figure A.9) and in other a combination of Ag sphere (60\u202fnm radius) on top and Ag triangle in underneath (60\u202fnm side length) as shown in Fig. 12 (a) and (c). Simulation result clearly indicates that the enhancement is of the order of two for the combined structure. The x-z view of electric field intensity distribution shows the highest enhancement occurs at the nanogap between the two structures and this is the main reason behind the enhancement. The EF map shows that the enhancement also occurs at the surface of the Ag sphere but the magnitude is lower. The maximum EF calculated for S1 sample like structure from FDTD simulation is ~108, which is greater than the EF calculated from the experiment using Eq. (3). As the direct correlation of SERS intensity with maximum field enhancement value at a local point is not practical because in the real sample the adsorption of R6G occurs at any random places on the metal particle and the EF obtained from experiment is the average contribution from all the adsorption sites. Li et al. have observed that for vertical stacking of Ag layer R6G can indeed pass through the 3D structure and find the hotspot situated between two nanoparticles [16]. The penetration can be reduced by including a spacer layer between them (i.e Graphene oxide layer). However, no such spacer layer is present in this case to hinder the penetration of R6G molecule. The EF obtained for S2 sample like structure is ~1011. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "(Fig. 12(d)), but in reality, it shows the opposite result. From TEM images, it is clear that the interparticle distance between the particles in S1 is very much smaller compared to the particles of S2. Kim et al. have observed that enhancement of the incident electric field is very much dependent on interparticle separation and this affects the SERS intensity dramatically [58]. To confirm this, we have done FDTD simulation to study the role of interparticle distances on EF, which is shown in Fig. 13 . An enhancement of 2400 is observed between the two particles when the interparticle distance is about 10\u202fnm (Fig. 13(a)). When we increase the distance from 10 to 25\u202fnm about 4 to 5 order of decrement in intensity is observed (Fig. 13(b)). This resulted in almost 105 order decrements in intensity at the middle portion of the two particles. This can be clearly seen if we compare Fig. 13(c) and (d). Su et al. observed that when the interparticle distance is greater than 2.5 times their short axis length, the coupling between them is almost negligible [59]. In the case of our S2 sample, the interparticle distance is large which resulted in smaller EF compared to S1.  We have studied the growth of silver on Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) substrate and observed the effect of RTA at O2 and N2 atmosphere. Endotaxial structures are produced on planar Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) due to annealing at O2 atmosphere. However, no such structure is observed during annealing at N2 atmosphere. The length of the endotaxial structure depends heavily on the initial Ag deposition time and it decreases with increasing deposition time. The endotaxial structure in combination with spherical Ag nanoparticle is observed to be a good SERS substrate which can detect R6G dye of concentration up to 10\u22127 mol. We have also shown the advantage of the combinational structure compared to only the spherical counterpart. We have demonstrated that embedded nanostructures are more stable compared to surface nanostructures having significant implication in SERS related application where the stability of the substrate is a major issue. The present methodology of simple fabrication route and data analysis will provide a new pathway towards the research on fabricating efficient SERS active stable substrate.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Presently, considering higher transparency (\u2a7e90%), 4.8\u20135.4 eV work function and moderate band gap energies, indium-tin-oxide (ITO) and fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) are commonly preferred TCOs in optoelectronic devices (Kim et al., 2002). However, the use of sophisticated techniques is unavoidable while developing these TCOs. Secondly, scarcity and expensiveness of indium and tin metals has posed a serious limitation on market feasibility. Furthermore, maintaining both properties (transparency and conductivity) are essentially critical; as conductivity is inversely proportional to transparency. For conductivity improvement it is necessary to (i) modify the metal oxide surface with oxygen plasma, and (ii) develop high quality single crystal structure. Unlike in solar cells, in applications like supercapacitors and fuel cells, transparency of base-substrate electrode is not important. However, in all these applications parameter so called conductivity has considerable impact. It is accepted that ITO is not thermally stable above 300 \u00b0C as its resistance increases due to an incorporation of environmental oxygen. Secondly, obtaining commercial-type ITO and FTO, due to limited availability, through chemical methods is practically difficult. Finally, both are expensive for routine daily uses thereby, several efforts have been made to search for alternatives including Zn-doped tin oxide and Cd-doped tin oxide, etc. (Jia et al., 2009). Sprayed boron-doped ZnO conducting and transparent substrates were previously successfully used in dye-sensitized solar cells (Pawar et al., 2009). Cadmium oxide (CdO) films are known for their smaller energy band gaps as compared to other metal oxides such as ZnO, TiO2, SnO2, V2O5, and WO3, which are being extensively used in phototransistors, solar cells, gas sensors, infra-red detectors, liquid crystal displays, supercapacitors and anti-reflection coatings, etc. (Waghulade et al., 2007; Kondo et al., 1971). Ordinarily, n-type conductivity of CdO is accepted as a result of the non-stoichiometry existing in the cadmium and oxygen. It was assumed that doping with suitable donors could enhance its electrical measurements to be semi-metallic. Till today, several sophisticated chemical and physical methods have been applied for synthesizing CdO thin films in different nanostructures (Yang et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2001). Consequently, it is worth to develop conducting CdO film which can act as base-electrode for growing another material. On the other hand, due to high specific capacitance (C s), well-defined electrochemical redox activity and lesser synthesis cost (Yuan et al., 2010; Xia et al., 2011), nanostructures of cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) are enormously been used in electrochemical supercapacitor (ES) application (Wang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2011). In literature, various conducting base-substrates have been encountered for growing Co(OH)2 nanostructures including indium-tin oxide (C s = 1128 F g\u22121) (Barbieri et al., 2014), stainless-steel (C s = 860 F g\u22121) (Gupta et al., 2007), and nickel foam (C s = 1017 F g\u22121) (Chang et al., 2007), etc., but, so far there is no report wherein conducting CdO has been used as base-electrode. In the present investigation, Co(OH)2 nanoplates were grown onto conducting CdO base-electrode by electrodeposition method and applied for ES application. For the first time, chemical spray method was employed to fabricate conducting CdO film as base-substrate for growing Co(OH)2. We do aware of the chemical toxicity of Cd-based materials. However, in continuation to preceding CdO nanostructure-based research (Chang et al., 2007), in the present paper, we made an attempt, for the first time, to use sprayed conducting CdO film electrodes for developing secondary product i.e. Co(OH)2 nanoplates which later were used as electrochemical supercapacitors.  Cadmium acetate [Cd(CH3COO)2], cobaltous nitrate [Co(NO3)2\u20136H2O], sodium sulfite [Na2SO3], etc. were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck Chemicals Ltd. and employed without any further purification. All the used solutions were newly prepared with double distilled water. An easy spray pyrolysis method offering effective composition control, homogeneity and uniformity was used for synthesizing conducting CdO films. For synthesizing conducting CdO films, Cd(CH3COO)2 in different concentrations (i.e. 0.5 M, 1.0 M and 1.5 M) were used. About 5 \u00d7 5 cm2 area glass substrate was used for deposition. These substrate (CdO) films were obtained onto soda-lime glass maintained at 723 K using Cd(CH3COO)2 precursor solution. The solution dispense rate and gas pressure were 2 ml min\u22121 and 20 kg cm\u22122, respectively. Compressed air was used as the carrier gas and the nozzle-to-substrate distance was 25 cm. The above parameters were optimized in order to achieve highly homogeneous and adherent CdO films. On spraying the aqueous solution of cadmium acetate over the hot glass substrate, pyrolytic decomposition was obtained, resulting in the formation of CdO film base-electrode. The deposited CdO base-electrode was brownish in appearance, highly adherent and semi-transparent. We believe transparency, application for which these electrodes were used, was not important one. Conductivity of the CdO film was controlled by varying cadmium acetate concentration (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 M). Deposited CdO films of various conductivities were naturally cooled to room temperature; as the morphology and the electrical properties are highly influenced by the rate of cooling. The Co(OH)2 nanoplates were grown onto pre-deposited conducting CdO film substrates using electrodeposition method at room temperature. This method has numerous benefits such as it is low temperature deposition method and simplicity of the set up. An electrodeposition process was carried out in a standard three-electrode system in the presence of 0.1 M Co(NO3)2\u20136H2O and Na2SO3 in 1:1 volumetric ratio. Platinum wire (in spiral form) was used as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl was the reference electrode. Deposition was carried out at 4 mA for 300 s. Finally, structural, morphological and electrical studies of obtained Co(OH)2 nanostructures over conducting CdO film electrodes were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and electrical conductivity techniques. For knowing the charge transportation kinetics electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were measured. Schematic representation of synthesis procedure of conducting CdO and Co(OH)2 nanostructures grown on CdO base-electrode (Co(OH)2\u2013CdO) is illustrated in Fig. 1. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", ". Structure and morphology of prepared films were analysed by using XRD (Model: Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at \u03bb = 0.154 nm and FE-SEM (Model: JSM-6700F), respectively. Electrical conductivity measurements of prepared CdO base-electrodes were measured on four probe measurement (SES Inst. Prv. Ltd.) set up. Electrochemical measurements such as cyclic-voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge (GCD) of as-synthesized CdO base-electrodes and Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes were carried out on a CHI 627B electrochemical analyzer by using typical three electrode system in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at various scan rate and current densities.  Fig.\u00a02 (a)\u2013(c) demonstrates the FE-SEM photoimages concerning the plane-views of sprayed CdO electrodes at 0.5 M, 1 M and 1.5 M of Cd(CH3COO)2 precursor concentrations. Surface morphologies of all the CdO base-electrodes were mushroom-type; quite different from formerly reported morphologies (Goldbarger et al., 2003; Yang and Zeng, 2004; Wang and Li, 2002; Li et al., 2004; Yu and Yam, 2004; Im et al., 2004; Ou et al., 2011). The spacing between two adjacent mushrooms decreased with an increase in Cd(CH3COO)2 concentration, signifying agglomeration potential of crystallites is a function of precursor concentration. It is worthwhile to mention here is that due to a poor adhesion CdO film was peeling-off from the glass substrate at higher Cd(CH3COO)2 concentrations (>1.5 M). Cross-sectional FESEM images of CdO film substrates prepared for 0.5 M, 1.0 M and 1.5 M concentrations are shown in Fig.\u00a03 (d)\u2013(f). Thicknesses of the prepared CdO films at 0.5 M, 1.0 M and 1.5 M concentrations were 690, 750 and 812 nm, respectively. Fig.\u00a03(a) shows the XRD spectra for CdO film electrodes deposited at different Cd(CH3COO)2 concentrations (i.e. 0.5 M, 1 M and 1.5 M). The XRD patterns in Fig.\u00a03(a) showed well-defined reflection planes which were matching well with the standard JCPDF (No.: 05-0640) file of CdO, indicating the formation of CdO without any impurity. Crystallite sizes, calculated by using well-known Scherrer\u2019s relation along highly oriented (2 0 0) peak, were 15, 16 and 27 nm for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 M precursor concentrations, respectively. Slight broadening, in peaks, was noticed confirming infinitesimal change in grain size with concentration, consistent to FE-SEM results. To investigate the conductivity change, current density\u2013voltage measurement tests were performed over three CdO base-electrodes in the range of 2\u20139 V at 1 \u00d7 1 cm2 electrode surface area and obtained results are displayed in Fig.\u00a03(b). During each measurement ohmic contacts were established. All the current\u2013voltage plots were linear demonstrating good conductivity; however, a slight change in their slopes was evidenced, indicating infinitesimal variation in conductivity as a function of cadmium source concentration. Surface conductivity increased from 2.0 to 5.71 mho cm\u22122 and activation energy decreased from 0.34 to 0.29 eV with increase in cadmium concentration from 0.5 to 1.5 M. We believe that our base-electrodes were partially transparent which practically had no impact on the present study, but exhibited conductivities comparable to other routinely used electrodes (0.22 mho cm\u22122-ITO, 2.3 mho cm\u22122-FTO and 7.49 mho cm\u22122-stainless-steel, etc.), demonstrating significance of sprayed CdO as base-electrode. The existence of shallow donors caused by intrinsic interstitial cadmium atoms and oxygen vacancies might responsible for high conductivity in CdO base-electrode. The XRD patterns of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes are shown in Fig.\u00a04 (a). The only difference was the conductivity of CdO base-electrode. The XRD peaks located at 2\u03b8= 18.57\u00b0, 35.45\u00b0, 45.30\u00b0 and 58.30\u00b0 well-matched with Co(OH)2 JCPDF data file no. 45-0031 having Braggs reflections (0 2 2), (0 0 4), (0 3 0) and (3 1 2), respectively. While, the other detected peaks at 2\u03b8 = 33.16\u00b0 and 55.30\u00b0 were due to the CdO base-electrode (JCPDF file no. 05-0640). No other impurity peaks were detected. Plane-views of Co(OH)2 grown onto CdO base-electrodes of different Cd-concentrations (0.5 M, 1 M and 1.5 M) are shown in Fig.\u00a04(b)\u2013(d). It was observed that at lower concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 M) Co(OH)2 nanoplates just begun to grow. As mentioned previously and novelty of work, CdO electrode (film) of best conductivity was used as base-substrate for depositing Co(OH)2. Basically, because of the conducting nature of CdO deposition of Co(OH)2 happened as for electrodeposition process use of conducting substrate is an essential criteria. During application of external voltage or current, ions of opposite charges migrate across the electrolyte and external circuit by producing a film of desired product. In short, in the present case CdO film acted as base conducting substrate so as to apply current for depositing Co(OH)2 in the presence of platinum cathode. At initial stage, upright-standing free nanoplates were not clearly seen. While for 1.5 M Cd-precursor concentration-based electrode, upright-standing free nanoplates with a large porosity were confirm. Such kind of porous morphology generally is preferred for supercapacitor application because it provides more surface area and open space for the electro-active species, which enhances the electrode\u2013electrolyte area (Liao et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2008, Chang and Hu, 2004; Tao et al., 2011).  Electrochemical properties such as CV and GCD of as-deposited Co(OH)2\u2013CdO films as working electrodes were performed in an optimized 0.1 M KOH electrolyte for supercapacitor application. CV measurements of CdO base-electrodes were carried out by using three-electrode system at 10 mV s\u22121 sweep rate (with wide window \u22120.2 to 0.8 V) and are displayed in Fig.\u00a05 (a). From Fig.\u00a05(a) it is observed that with increase in precursor concentration area under the curve increased as well as the redox peaks were evidently seen indicating pseudocapacitor behaviour. Also the value of maximum current (I max) increased from 0.3 mA cm\u22122 (for 0.5 M) to 0.44 mA cm\u22122 (for 1.5 M); implying increase in specific capacitance with concentration of Cd-precursor. Fig. 5(b) shows the CV curves of Co(OH)2 grown on CdO base-electrodes at 10 mV s\u22121 sweep rate with \u22120.2 to 0.8 V potential window. Area under curve in case of 1.5 M concentration was higher as compared to 0.5 and 1 M concentrations. Presence of different redox peaks in CV suggesting influence of CdO base-electrode conductivity on specific capacitance of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes. Also from Fig.\u00a05(b), a higher specific. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "capacitance (for 1.5 M; which explained in detail further) anticipated on account of upright-standing free Co(OH)2 nanoplate-type morphology which in general facilitates fast penetration of the electrolyte ions into the active Co(OH)2 nanoplates. The C s values of electrodes from GCD curves were calculated by using the following formula: Cs=I\u00d7\u0394tm\u00d7\u0394V where \u2018I\u2019 is the discharge current in Ampere, \u2018\u0394t\u2019 is the discharge time in second, \u2018m\u2019 is the active mass of the electrode material in gram and \u2018\u0394V\u2019 is the potential window in volt. GCD curves of CdO and Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes are shown Fig.\u00a05(c)\u00a0and\u00a0(d), respectively at fixed current density of 8 mA\u00a0cm\u22122. Charging\u2013discharging behaviour was identical in both the cases. Increase in discharging time with respect to Cd-precursor concentration can be clearly seen from Fig.\u00a05(c)\u00a0and\u00a0(d). Discharging times for CdO electrodes were found to be 78, 96 and 113 s for 0.5, 1, and 1.5 M concentrations, respectively. C s values of CdO electrodes calculated from Eq. (1) were 249, 278 and 312 Fg\u22121 for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 M Cd-recursor concentrations, respectively at 10 mV s\u22121 scan sweep. GCD curve of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes for different Cd-precursor concentrations is shown in Fig.\u00a05(d). The charging time of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes were 452, 549 and 641 s, while the discharging times were 377, 405 and 449 s, respectively for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 M Cd-precursor concentrations. For discharging, due to an internal resistance and a capacitive component variations the voltage was slowly dropped (Zhang et al., 2012). Calculated C s value for Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes were 937 Fg\u22121, 1005 Fg\u22121 and 1119 Fg\u22121 for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 M Cd-precursor concentration, respectively. This relatively higher C s (1119 Fg\u22121) value for 1.5 M Cd-concentration electrode was mainly due to its higher conductivity (Fig.\u00a03(b)). The graphical representation of specific capacitance values, obtained from Fig. 5(c) and (d), is shown in Fig. 5(e). Furthermore, nanoplate-like structure of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrode (Fig.\u00a04(d)) might provide more surface area for electrolyte diffusion and fast and easy transportation of electrons. Also, from literature it was clear that CdO itself contribute its own specific capacitance (Xia et al., 2011) that might add in Co(OH)2\u2013CdO. When Co(OH)2 grown onto CdO base-electrodes of different conductivities, these electrodes showed higher specific capacitances. It was due to contributions of the base-electrode (conducting CdO) and the Co(OH)2 nanoplates, which was undoubtedly comparable to other reported values for Co(OH)2 nanostructures only (Cao et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2010; Gupta et al., 2007). This corroborated that the CdO film electrode obtained onto glass substrate could serve as a potential working electrode and opened a new avenue for depositing variety of nanostructures of either metal oxides or hydroxides, which is a topic of ongoing work. Long term cyclic stability is essential for practical application of supercapacitor. Cyclic stability of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrode (1.5 M concentration) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte measured at 10 mV s\u22121 sweep rate is presented in Fig.\u00a06 (a). Due to the loss of active material caused by the dissolution and/or detachment in the electrolyte, decrease in the specific capacity with number of cycles was observed. After 1000 cycles, C s value of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrode retained 54% of its original value. From the practical and commercial views of supercapacitor energy and power densities are considered as crucial factors. Energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated with the help of following equations (Wu et al., 2010): E=0.5\u00d7Cs\u00d7\u0394V2 P=ETd where \u2018E\u2019 is in W h kg\u22121, \u2018P\u2019 is in kW kg\u22121, \u2018\u0394V\u2019 refers to potential window during the discharge process in volt and \u2018Td\u2019 is discharging time. Values of E and P were calculated for all electrodes and tabulated in Table 1 . Conducting CdO electrodes demonstrated lower energy densities (from 22.13 to 27.55 W h kg\u22121) and higher power densities (from 1.02 to 0.87 kW kg\u22121). On the other hand, Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrode of optimal conductivity (1.5 M Cd-precursor concentration) showed as high as energy density of 98.83 W h kg\u22121 and good power density of 0.75 kW kg\u22121. Based on the obtained electrochemical results it was concluded that, Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrode, developed at 1.5 M Cd-precursor concentration exhibited excellent capacitive performances than the other concentrations, indicating its potential as a base-electrode material in supercapacitor application. In order to examine the internal resistance and charge transfer kinematics, EIS measurements were carried out. Fig.\u00a06(c) shows the Nyquist plots of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrodes at different Cd-precursor concentrations in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz with an ac signal of 1 mV amplitude. Very small semicircle in high frequency area and a line in the lower frequency area were confirmed in Nyquist spectra. Small semicircle not visualised in the Nyquist spectra suggested that all the electrodes were holding lower charge transfer resistance. It showed relatively higher charge transfer resistance for 0.5 M Cd-precursor concentration and lower for 1.5 M Cd-precursor concentration, implying that electrochemical supercapacitors performance of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrode was Cd-precursor concentration dependent.  In summary, synthesis of dopant-free conducting CdO film base-electrodes of mushroom-like surfaces was carried out by varying cadmium acetate concentration (from 0.5 to 1.5 M) on glass substrate using spray pyrolysis method. On these conducting CdO base-electrodes upright-standing Co(OH)2 nanoplates were grown by a simple electrodeposition method and applied for pseudocapacitor (supercapacitor) application. Electrochemical measurements of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO electrode at 1.5 M Cd-concentration demonstrated C s value as high as 1119 F g\u22121 at 10 mV s\u22121 as well as rate capability together in CV and GCD measurements. After 1000 cycles, C s value of Co(OH)2\u2013CdO (1.5 M) electrode retained 54% of its original value of capacitance as well as exhibited high energy density of 98.83 W h kg\u22121 with power density of 0.75 kW kg\u22121. Undoubtedly, the use of conducting CdO base-electrode would open a new potential for energy storage device where conducting thin film counter electrodes are required in contrast to conventional bulk current collectors.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2018.05.023.txt", "paper": ["Until now, black silicon (BS) light trapping structures, including nanowires [1\u20133] and nanoholes [4\u20135], have demonstrated their excellent anti-reflectance properties, providing the opportunities for enhancing light-harvesting on c-Si. However, despite of the superior light absorption enhancement, the efficiency of BS solar cells remains relatively low compared to those of conventional c-Si solar cells, which is caused by the dramatic increase in Auger and surface recombination of the cells due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of the Si nanostructures. Therefore, carefully designed new nanostructures such as inverted pyramids (IPs) [6,7] and nanocones [8,9] with low surface area enhancement by lithography method, have be done to balance the relationship between optical gain and recombination loss. Of all these structures, IPs are mostly adopted for its excellent light absorption and easy surface passivation, and the successful fabrication of IPs based solar cells with an efficiency 24.7% further confirms its superiority for high efficiency solar cells [10]. However, the lithography method used for fabricating such structures is costly and time-consuming, which hinders its further implement for mass production. Recently, a cost-effective and efficient approach called metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) method has been developed to avoid the above disadvantages for industrial mass production. Until now, two step method including MACE BS fabrication and a post structure reshaping process is believed to be a feasible way to connect nanostructure texture with high efficiency Si solar cells [11]. In 2014, Ye et al. reported an IPs (size of \u223c260\u202fnm) based 156\u202f\u00d7\u202f156\u202fmm2 multi-crystalline Si solar cell with an efficiency of 18.45% (Jsc\u202f=\u202f36.68\u202fmA/cm2) by MACE process and a post treatment with low concentration NaOH solution [12]. In 2016, we proposed a randomly positioned quasi-inverted pyramids (QIPs) structure (size of \u223c550\u202fnm) on ultrathin c-Si by MACE method followed by a post nanostructure rebuilding (NSR) process, and the realization of 4.2-fold material usage reduction based on the QIPs structure and its easy surface passivation demonstrated its potential application ability in ultrathin c-Si solar cells [13]. In 2017, we studied the effect of AgNO3 concentration during the MACE process on QIPs size, and it was found that the QIPs size could be adjusted from 794\u202fnm to 1101\u202fnm accompanied with the reduction of its surface area from \u223c3.29 to \u223c1.89 along with modulating the AgNO3 concentration from 0.25\u202fmM to 0.75\u202fmM [14]. With a further extension of NSR time, QIPs would gradually evolve into IPs accompanied with the increase of their surface reflectance. For hetero-junction solar cells such as PEDOT:PSS/c-Si hybrid solar cells, QIPs are good choices due to their low surface reflectance and conformal coating of PEDOT:PSS materials, while for the conventional diffusion-based c-Si solar cells, the severe Auger recombination caused by the non-uniform diffusion on the spikes of QIPs can greatly deteriorate the cell performance [11]. Therefore, IPs are preferred on diffusion-based c-Si solar cells. In the same year, Jiang et al. in our group reported a large IPs (size of \u223c500\u202fnm) based 156\u202f\u00d7\u202f156\u202fmm2 multi-crystalline Si solar cell with an efficiency of 18.62% (Jsc\u202f=\u202f36.74\u202fmA/cm2) by our method, the efficiencies of which have exceeded that of conventional acid textured solar cells in the same period [15]. The fabrication process of the IPs is quite simple, scalable, and cost-effective, paving a road to mass production in industrial processes. It is known that the IPs size can greatly influence the optical and electrical properties of Si solar cells. The question arises whether IPs can be controllably fabricated. Therefore, it remains a challenge to realize the size control fabrication of IPs on c-Si through a mask-less wet chemical method. In this article, size control fabrication of IPs is realized from sub-micro scale to micro scale for light trapping on c-Si through a mask-less wet chemical method followed by a systematic study of the underlying formation mechanism for the first time. The IPs are fabricated through a well-known two-step Ag assisted chemical method followed by a post NSR process. The size of the obtained IPs is controlled by varying MACE temperature, and the IPs size can be adjusted from 768\u202fnm to 1884\u202fnm along with increasing the MACE temperature from 25\u202f\u00b0C to 60\u202f\u00b0C. Base on the experiment results, it is concluded that more Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) etched in non-vertical directions instead of the original vertical one at higher MACE temperature due to the shrink of AgNPs, leaving behind few pore channels in the deepest region of BS layer as nucleation sites, and thus large IPs can be formed during the following NSR process. The elucidation of the fundamental formation will open up a new way to the controllable and producible fabrication of a low-cost and excellent texture for its application in bulk and ultrathin c-Si solar cells.  Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.99%), hydrofluoric acid (HF, 50%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) and ammonia (NH3\u00b7H2O, 30%) were all purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.. All the reagents were used without further purification. The IPs were fabricated through a well-known two-step Ag assisted chemical etching method followed by a post NSR process. The two-step structuration process used in this work was described in Fig. 1 . Typically, p-type (1\u202f0\u202f0) Czochralski (CZ) Si wafers (resistivity, 1\u20135\u202f\u03a9\u00b7cm) with a thickness of about 182\u202f\u00b5m were firstly immersed into an aqueous solution containing HF (3.68\u202fM) and AgNO3 (0.5\u202fmM) for 10\u202fs at room temperature for electro-less Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) coating. Then, the silver coated wafers were dipped into an etching solution consisting of DI water, HF (7.36\u202fM) and H2O2 (4.58\u202fM) for 60\u202fs to form nanoporous black silicon (BS) structures under different temperatures (25\u202f\u00b0C, 40\u202f\u00b0C and 60\u202f\u00b0C). Finally, the as-etched wafers were transferred into a solution containing NH3\u00b7H2O and H2O2 for 90\u202fs to remove the AgNPs remaining in the c-Si. For IPs formation, the nanoporous structures were restructured in a NSR solution (containing H2O2 and additive with certain ratio) for different time (2\u202fmin, 4\u202fmin, 15\u202fmin, 20\u202fmin and 25\u202fmin) at 50\u202f\u00b0C after rinsed in 5\u202fwt% HF aqueous solution for 10\u202fs. After NSR treatment, the samples were subsequently rinsed in 5\u202fwt% HF aqueous solution and DI water for 1\u202fmin and dried under N2 stream. BS-25, BS-40 and BS-60. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "below refer to the black silicon samples fabricated under different MACE temperatures while the IP-25, IP-40 and IP-60 are the corresponding inverted pyramid samples with 25\u202fmin NSR treatment. The numeric number here all denoted the MACE temperature. The surface morphology of the samples was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). For a detailed investigation of BS layer thickness, backscattered electron (BSE) imaging was performed. The reflectance measurement was carried out by UV\u2013Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600, with an integrating sphere) in the wavelength range of 300\u20131100\u202fnm. The IPs size on the Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface was characterized by using the image analysis software Nano Measurer. In order to investigate the porous layer in BS structures, raman spectroscopy was performed using a WITec alpha 300 with 532\u202fnm excitation laser in air under ambient conditions. The photoluminescence spectra (PL, PTIQM40-NIR) of all the BS samples was obtained at room temperature by exciting the samples through a 355\u202fnm He-Cd laser at an output power of 30\u202fmW to further demonstrate the characteristics of the BS layers.  Fig. 2 (a)\u2013(c) shows the top-view SEM images of BS fabricated under different MACE temperatures. It can be seen that all the BS surfaces are made of sponge-like structures, and the cross-section SEM images of all the corresponding samples depict the presence of small pores propagating into the bulk from the surface in a random manner (Fig. 2(d)\u2013(f)). After etching in HF/H2O2 mixture solution, the nanopores proceed randomly into the substrate for \u223c1.89\u202f\u00b5m at 25\u202f\u00b0C, \u223c6.86\u202f\u00b5m at 40\u202f\u00b0C and \u223c9.54\u202f\u00b5m at 60\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. The thickness of the nanoporous layer is visualized by BSE images (Fig. 2(g)\u2013(i)). Nanopores are very dense near the surface and often cluster into wider pores. Under 25\u202f\u00b0C MACE condition, the BS possesses smooth surfaces covered with a lot of small pores (diameters of few tens of nanometers size) emphasized by the red circles (Fig. 2(j)), and the corresponding cross-section SEM image shown in Fig. 2(m) reveals the vertical etching behavior of AgNPs. However, the surfaces of BS-40 and BS-60 become rough as shown in Fig. 2(k) and (l), respectively, and the enlarged cross-section morphologies of both corresponding samples shown in Fig. 2(n) and (o) reveal the switch of etching direction from the vertical ones to the lateral and inclined ones in comparison with that of BS-25, leaving behind a great amount of small nanopores randomly distributed in the porous BS layer. The red arrows in all the SEM images are adopted as eye guides for the etching direction. It is well accepted that the silicon nanostructures are formed through AgNPs catalyzed electroless etching. The total reaction is as follows [16]: Si0\u202f+\u202f2H2O2\u202f+\u202f6F\u2212\u202f+\u202f4H+\u202f\u2192\u202f[SiF6]2\u2212\u202f+\u202f4H2O For the same type of silicon wafer, the etching process at equilibrium of the electrochemical reaction can be characterized by the Nernst relationship as follows [17]: \u0394E=\u0394E0+RT2FlnH2O22F-6H+4SiF62- in which \u0394E is the equilibrium potential, \u0394E 0 is the equilibrium potential in standard condition, R is the ideal-gas constant 8.314\u202fJ\u202fkmol\u22121, T is the absolute temperature, [H2O2], [F\u2212], [H+] and [SiF6 2\u2212] are the molar concentration of H2O2, F\u2212, H+ and SiF6 2\u2212 in the etching solution, respectively. According to Eq. (2), the etching rate is expected to increase with increasing MACE temperature, which explains why thicker BS layer is obtained with a higher MACE temperature. During the etching process, AgNPs can be converted into Ag+ by H2O2 [18]. At a low MACE temperature, the generated Ag+ ions can be rapidly recovered back to Ag by taking electrons from silicon. A higher MACE temperature leads to a higher Ag+ ions concentration and diffusion coefficient, which provides more chances for the generated Ag+ ions to diffuse upwards and re-nucleate on the sidewalls of the pore channels to form new etching sites (discussed later). As a result, surface roughness and porosity increase at high MACE temperature. When 25\u202fmin NSR treatment is adopted, all the Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) surfaces are compactly covered with IPs structures (Fig. 3 (a)\u2013(c)). The IP-25 has sizes mainly distributed from 671\u202fnm to 865\u202fnm with a mean value of 768\u202fnm (Fig. 3(g)). With regard to the IP-40, the mean size of IPs is 1240\u202fnm (Fig. 3(h)), indicating a 472\u202fnm increase of IPs size as compared to that of the IP-25 case. A further increase of MACE temperature makes the IPs size drastically increase to a mean value of 1884\u202fnm (Fig. 3(i)). The cross-section SEM images of the IPs structures shown in Fig. 3(d)\u2013(f) reveal that the angle between the structure surface and Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) surface is 54.7\u00b0, indicating the Si (1\u202f1\u202f1) plane termination of the facets. The formation of IPs is due to the anisotropic etching character of our NSR solution. Compared with the modulation of QIPs size by adjusting AgNO3 concentration in our previous work, the change of MACE temperature can realize a wider rang control of IPs size, indicating the great influence of MACE temperature on structure sizes. In order to investigate the light trapping performance of different samples, reflectance (R) spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4 (a). Simultaneously, conventional micro pyramid is also adopted for comparison. The average reflectance (Ravg) used here can be defined as [19]: Ravg=\u222b3001100R\u03bbN\u03bbd\u03bb\u222b3001100N\u03bbd\u03bb where R(\u03bb) \u2013 total reflectance, N(\u03bb) \u2013 the solar flux under AM 1.5 standard condition. One can clearly see that the reflectance of BS samples increases (Ravg of \u223c4.17%, \u223c5.0% and \u223c11.19% shown in Fig. 4(b)) in the wavelength range of 300\u20131100\u202fnm and the maximum point of the reflection gradually shifts to long wavelength along with increasing the MACE temperature, while the Ravg of IPs decreases from 12.11% to 8.9% with increasing MACE temperature from 25\u202f\u00b0C to 60\u202f\u00b0C, and the Ravg of IP-60 is lower than that of micro pyramid, indicating the superiority of IP-60 as light trapping structures in c-Si solar cells. Macroscopically, the increase of Ravg can also be confirmed by the color evolution of BS surfaces from black to dark-yellow (photographs in the lower left-hand corner of Fig. 2(a)\u2013(c)). In theory, reflectance change can always be ascribed to the change of the refractive index profile from. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "air to substrate [20]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the refractive index profile of the BS changes with MACE temperature, and the change of refractive index profile can always be ascribed to the morphology change. As a result, the cross sections of all the BS samples are closely observed in Fig. 5 (a)\u2013(c), and it can be clearly seen that BS including a top nanoporous layer and an underlying pore channel layer are formed, and the two layer feature of the formed BS can be further confirmed by BSE images shown in Fig. 6 . The summary of thickness evolution of all the layer as a function of MACE temperature is displayed in Fig. 5(d). Obviously, all the layer becomes consistently thicker with increasing MACE temperature. Additionally, nanopores emphasized by the red dotted circles disperse randomly in the bottom layer, and are clearly seen in BS-40 and BS-60 samples while they can be rarely detected for the BS-25 case. In other words, a monotonic trend in the number of emphasized wide nanopores in the bottom layer vs MACE temperature is observed. Progressively fewer long nanopores extend more deeply, resulting in a density-graded layer. Fig. 7 shows the variation of structure configuration and related effective diffraction index profile for different BS samples. Accompanying the shape change from pure vertical channels to lateral nanopores embedded vertical channels, the effective refractive indexes between the top surface and the bulk c-Si change from gradient to step-like variation, leading to an increased reflectance over a broad wavelength range. As the IPs size can be widely controlled by the variation of MACE temperature with the other procedure controlled to be the same, a reasonable etching model should be proposed. Obviously, a suitable model must be able to explain the following issues: (1) How does the BS structure influence the IPs size? (2) How does the MACE temperature influence the BS structure? In order to shed light on the first issue, surface evolution of BS layer with respect to NSR treatment time are observed by SEM. The effect of NSR treatment time is shown in a series of top-view and cross-section images in Fig. 8 . As can be seen in Fig. 8(a) and (b), the top sponge-like porous layer readily dissolved during the first few minutes of etching, leading to high aspect ratio channels with open square structures. This is totally consistent with a preferential etching of nanoporous Si with respect to bulk Si [21] and is confirmed by the observation of a higher bubble evolution rate during the first period of etching. After 3\u20134\u202fmin, the rate of bubble evolution clearly decreases, suggesting that the whole top sponge-like porous layer is etched. However, after a period of time, the bubble evolution does not stop but proceed at a slower rate, indicating that the etching of bulk Si takes place. Fig. 8(c) and (d) shows that 4\u202fmin of etching produces larger cavities with wider apertures. With further extending the NSR time to 15\u202fmin, relatively low aspect ratio channels with wider lateral sizes can be observed on the surface (Fig. 8(e) and (f)). When 20\u202fmin NSR treatment is adopted, the original round channel bottom is anisotropically etched into inverted pyramids bottom made of (1\u202f1\u202f1) facets (Fig. 8(g) and (h)). Typical inverted pyramid with an average size of 1884\u202fnm is finally obtained by 25\u202fmin NSR treatment of BS-60 (Fig. 3(c) and (f)). In summary, the morphological evolution shown in Fig. 8 can be easily understood by the preferential etching of the top nanoporous layer that quickly dissolved, leading to a random template of high aspect ratio channels. The further etching of the template induces the widening of channels accompanied with the removal of its sidewalls (spikes), resulting in the formation of inverted pyramid. Macroscopically, the reflectance of different samples can be roughly estimated through a clear evolution of surface color from light-yellow to dark-blue during the NSR process, which can be observed in the lower left-hand insets of Fig. 8(a), (c), (e) and (g) and Fig. 3(c). Theoretically, larger IPs can be obtained provided that less nucleation sites (IPs bottom tips) are supplied in a controlled area. On the basis of experimental results, it is believed that it is the channel density in the deepest region of BS layers that finally determines nucleation sites, and thus affects the final IP sizes. Progressively fewer long channels extend more deeply at higher MACE temperature, resulting in the reduction of nucleation sites at high MACE temperature. Fig. 8(b) reveals that the average distance between the deepest adjacent channels is \u223c1680\u202fnm, which is comparable to that of the IPs size by chance, while the average value (\u223c713\u202fnm) as shown in Fig. 9 (c) is also comparable to that of IP-25. The comparable value of the distance between the deepest adjacent channels to that of the corresponding IPs size confirms the fact that it is the nucleation sites that finally determine the IPs sizes. As a result, another issue should be addressed, that is, how does the MACE temperature affect the BS structure (the nucleation sites)? In the two-step MACE process, AgNPs are firstly deposited on the Si surface. When the etching process is initiated, the AgNPs serve as a cathode while the Si serves as an anode to form an electrochemical cell. The half-cell reactions are as follows [22,23]: Anode (Si): Si0\u202f+\u202f6F\u2212\u202f\u2192\u202f[SiF6]2\u2212\u202f+\u202f4e\u2212 E0\u202f=\u202f1.365\u202fV Cathode (Ag): H2O2\u202f+\u202f2H+\u202f+\u202f2e \u2212\u202f\u2192\u202f2H2O E0\u202f=\u202f1.76\u202fV At the anode, the silicon is continuously dissolved by electron transferring to the upper surface of AgNPs to reduce H2O2 to H2O. AgNPs, while serving as a cathode, can also be oxidized immediately and partially dissolved in solution to form Ag+ ions by H2O2 according to Eq. (7) (obtained by Eq. (5) \u2013 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fEq. (6)). Ag+\u202f+\u202fe \u2212\u202f\u2192\u202fAg E0\u202f=\u202f0.80\u202fV 2Ag\u202f+\u202fH2O2\u202f+\u202f2H+\u202f\u2192\u202f2Ag+\u202f+\u202f2H2O \u0394E\u202f=\u202f0.16\u202fV On the other hand, the formed Ag+ ions can be quickly reduced back to Ag by taking electrons from the interface of AgNPs and Si before they can diffuse out: Si\u202f+\u202f4Ag+\u202f+\u202f6F\u2212\u202f\u2192\u202f4Ag\u202f+\u202f[SiF6]2\u2212 \u0394E\u202f=\u202f4.56\u202fV As a result, the Ag+ ions are confined in the close proximity. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of AgNPs. In this way, the AgNPs are confined in the nanopits they create and the Si below the AgNPs is continuously etched down to form the silicon nanopores. As the potential of Eq. (8) is much greater than that of Eq. (7), the Eq. (8) is kinetically more feasible. Therefore, the AgNPs catalyzed etching process (Eq. (1)) is mostly limited by Eq. (7). In other words, the faster the Eq. (7) reacts, the faster the Eq. (1) proceeds. The reaction rate of Eq. (7) can be characterized by the reaction rate equation as follows: r=kH2O2H+2 where r is the reaction rate, k is the rate constant, [H2O2] and [H+] are the molar concentration of H2O2 and H+ in the solution, respectively. Reaction rates depend strongly on temperature, nearly always increasing when the temperature is raised, which is consistent with what is observed in this work. The increase of reaction rate with temperature originates mostly from the increase of k with temperature, and the relation of rate constant and temperature can always be described by the following Arrhenius equation [24]: k=k0e-Ea/RT in which k 0 is called the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the ideal-gas constant 8.314\u202fJ\u202fkmol\u22121, T is the absolute temperature. It can be clearly determined that the k increase with increasing MACE temperature, meaning more Ag+ ions appears around the AgNPs at higher MACE temperature. Simultaneously, the high temperature makes the formed Ag+ ions diffuse upward easily before being reduced back to Ag at the interface of AgNPs and Si, and renucleation of AgNPs at other places may happen, leading to the formation of small pores in the Si. As a result, top nanoporous layers can be observed in the BS layer accompanied with the decrease of distance between the deepest adjacent channels at high MACE temperature. On the basis of the theory discussed above, high temperature can accelerate the small pore formation on the Si substrate due to the dissolution of AgNPs, leading to the shrink of AgNPs. As observed in Fig. 2, all the BS surfaces exhibit porous features, and the pore size appears to be on the order of a few nanometers. It is reported in the literature that the porosity can be characterized by its effect on the energy of the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon in silicon [25]. Therefore, Raman spectra of the LO phonon peak for a polished Si sample and all the as-obtained BS samples fabricated under different MACE temperatures are measured and shown in Fig. 10 . It reveals that the LO peaks shift to lower wavenumbers for the BS samples fabricated under higher MACE temperature. The shift of the LO peak has been attributed to phonon confinement in quasi-spherical nanocrystallite, and can be used to calculate the crystallite size according to the equation in following [26]: D=2\u03c0B\u0394\u03c912 where D is the crystallite size, B is a constant (B\u202f=\u202f2\u202fcm\u22121\u202fnm2 for silicon) and \u0394\u03c9 is the raman shift. All the calculated crystallite sizes are listed in Table 1 , and it can be clearly seen that the crystallite size decreases from 4.68\u202fnm to 2.87\u202fnm with increasing the MACE temperature from 25\u202f\u00b0C to 60\u202f\u00b0C, indicating that the porosity increase with increasing MACE temperature. In order to further confirm the porosity change under different MACE temperatures, photoluminescence (PL) tests are done on all the BS samples. Fig. 11 (a) gives the PL spectra of different BS samples excited under the wavelength of 355\u202fnm at ambient atmosphere, and it can be clearly seen that the PL peak intensity increases with increasing the MACE temperature. According to the quantum confinement model, the PL emission position and peak intensity are strongly related to the nanocrystallite size and the density of nanocrystallites [27], respectively. It is suspected that there is a distribution of nanocrystallite size, since all the PL peaks show a certain width, and their size are close to each other so that the emission is around a certain peak. For all the fitted PL spectra in Fig. 11(b)\u2013(d), two PL peaks (Peak-a and Peak-b) appear, indicating the presence of two types of nanocrystallites. Compared with Peak-b, Peak-a exhibits a much stronger intensity for all the BS samples, meaning that the nanocrystallite density corresponding to Peak-a plays a predominant role. The detailed positions of Peak-a and Peak-b for the different BS samples are listed in Table 2 . As can be seen, the Peak-a position blue shifts from 565\u202fnm to 549\u202fnm with increasing MACE temperature, which indicates that the nanocrystallite size decreases at higher MACE temperature. The presence of small portion of Peak-b indicates that small portion of large nanocrystallite exists in all the BS samples. The estimation from PL spectra agrees well with the Raman data described in the above section. The above experimental results clearly illustrate MACE temperature plays a role in the pore size control, which agrees well with the etching dynamics we proposed. That is, the higher the MACE temperature is, the faster the dissolution of AgNPs proceeds. Thus the shrink of the original large AgNPs occurs accompanied with the renucleation of smaller AgNPs on Si surface, resulting in the formation of smaller pores in the nanoporous layer. As described above, all the BS layers consist of a top nanoporous layer and an underlying pore channel layer. The formation of the top nanoporous layer may be due to the direct etching of all the renucleated AgNPs. With increasing MACE temperature, more lateral pores can be observed in the underlying channel layers as shown in Fig. 5(a)\u2013(c), and all the pores are in the same depth level, meaning that it is not the depth difference that leads to the switch of the etching directions. Generally, the channels are oriented perpendicularly to the sample surfaces, while lateral pores appears at low H2O2 concentration [28]. With the MACE process proceeding, the etched pores extend deeper and deeper into the Si substrate. In this case, the H2O2 concentration near the etching front in the etched pores is reduced, and has to be supplied. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "by diffusion from the bulk solution into the pores. With the decrease in H2O2 concentration, the etching switches from the vertical [1\u202f0\u202f0] direction to lateral or inclined ones. Electroless deposition of silver always results in the isolated AgNPs on Si (1\u202f0\u202f0) substrate (Fig. 12 (a)), and the diameter of the AgNPs is nonuniformly distributed in the range of 10\u2013110\u202fnm (Fig. 12(b)). High MACE temperature accelerates the dissolution rate of AgNPs, and thus more original large AgNPs shrink to smaller ones before the etching of bottom channel layer occurs. Therefore, more shrinking AgNPs may etch in non-vertical directions, leaving behind fewer pores in the deepest region of the bottom channel layer, and thus large IPs structures can form in the next NSR process. After a systematic study of the IPs formation process, a schematic illustration of the etching model for size control fabrication of IPs structures by varying the MACE temperature is shown in Fig. 13 . In the BS formation process, AgNPs are firstly deposited on Si surface by electroless Ag plating. When the etching process is initiated, the dissolution rate of AgNPs is expected to increase with increasing MACE temperature due to their direct contact with the bulk etching solution, and thus more Ag+ can diffuse upwards from the bottom of formed pores and re-nucleate on the sidewall of the pores. Those newly nucleated small AgNPs can serve as the new etching sites for the formation of small pores on the pore sidewalls, leading to the formation of top nanoporous layer. Therefore, more small pores can be formed under higher MACE temperature. Generally, the deposited AgNPs possess a wide range of size distribution. High MACE temperature renders more original large AgNPs shrink to smaller ones before the formation of bottom channel layer occurs. It is reported that the etching switch from the vertical [1\u202f0\u202f0] direction to lateral or inclined ones at low H2O2 concentration. With the MACE process proceeding, the etched pores extend deeper and deeper into the Si substrate. As a result, the H2O2 concentration near the etching front in the etched pores is reduced, and has to be supplied by diffusion from the bulk solution into the pores. However, the smaller the pore sizes are, the more difficult the supply of etching solution from bulk solution into the channel is, leading to the switch of etching happens on more AgNPs at higher MACE temperature. Then fewer channels exist in the deepest region of the bottom layer, indicating the reduction of nucleation sites for IPs structures. During the NSR process, the preferential etching of the top nanoporous layer occurs due to its high surface area, leading to a random template of high aspect ratio channels. The further etching of the template induces the widening of channels accompanied with the removal of its sidewalls (spikes), resulting in the formation of inverted pyramid. In conclusion, it is the variation of deepest pore channel numbers due to the MACE temperature change that leads to the size control fabrication of IPs structures  In conclusion, fabrication of IPs from sub-micro scale to micro scale for light trapping on c-Si through MACE method was realized and followed by a systematic study on underlying formation mechanism for the first time. The IPs were fabricated through a well-known two-step Ag assisted chemical method followed by a post NSR process. The IPs size could be adjusted from 768\u202fnm to 1884\u202fnm along with increasing the MACE temperature from 25\u202f\u00b0C to 60\u202f\u00b0C. Different from the nanowires or nanopores always observed in the literatures, our BS layers consisted of a top nanoporous layer and an underlying pore channel layer, and the thickness of both layers increased with increasing MACE temperature. In the etching solution at low MACE temperature, the usual crystallographically preferred [1\u202f0\u202f0] etching direction prevailed in the underlying pore channel layer, and the etching proceeded in vertical direction with respect to the (1\u202f0\u202f0) Si substrate surface, whereas the etching proceeded partially in non-vertical directions in the underlying layer if a high MACE temperature was adopted. Besides, the higher the MACE temperature was, the more frequently the non-vertical etching happened. Through a time dependent NSR experiment on the BS structure, the morphological evolution during our NSR process could be understood by the preferential etching of the top nanoporous layer followed by the formation of a random template of high aspect ratio channels. The further etching of the template induced the widening of channels accompanied with the removal of its sidewalls (spikes), resulting in the formation of IPs. It is concluded that at higher MACE temperature more AgNPs etched in non-vertical directions instead of the original vertical one due to the shrink of AgNPs, leaving behind few pore channels in the deepest region of black silicon (BS) layer as nucleation sites. Thus large IPs could be formed during the following NSR process. The elucidation of the fundamental formation will pave a new way to the controllable and producible fabrication of a low-cost and excellent texture for application in bulk and ultrathin c-Si solar cells.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The collision of ions onto a surface leads to a large variety of processes often strongly dependent on the projectile parameters, projectile kinetic energy, impact angle and surface temperature as well as crystal orientation [5]. The projectile may be adsorbed to [6] or implanted into [7,8] the surface, predominantly concomitant with neutralization. The projectile may also be scattered from the surface, often in a different charge state or sometimes chemically modified due to fragmentation [9] or reactions with surface atoms [10]. Momentum transfer to atoms of the target surface can result in the emission of atoms or ions from the surface (sputtering). Hollow cathode [11,12], glow discharges [13] and magnetron sputtering [14] are common tools for physical vapor deposition and thin film formation. For insulating surfaces, efficient removal of neutral and ionized target particles due to the potential rather than the kinetic energy of impinging slow, highly charged ions, has been reported (potential sputtering) [15]. Electron emission from the target surface is another common reaction. For electron bombardment, the ion induced electron emission yield (IEEY) has been investigated in great detail for various materials [16,17] and the presence of oxides [18,19] or adsorbate layers [20,21]. Many of these studies have been motivated due the importance of the ion induced electron emission yield for scanning electron microscopy [22], electron accelerators [23] and high-power microwave devices [24]. For ions as projectiles, substantially fewer studies are found in the literature [25\u201327]. The ion induced emission of electrons is the first step in the detection of ions in a secondary electron multiplier device [2,28]. As in the case of sputtering of surface atoms, the emission of electrons from a surface is promoted by the kinetic energy (kinetic emission) [29] and the potential energy (potential emission) [30\u201332] of the projectile. Potential emission can be related to electronic transitions between the projectile and the surface before the collision has taken place. It arises from an Auger-type process [30] and has a threshold energy that is twice the surface work function of the target. In contrast, kinetic emission is initiated after the projectile makes contact with the surface. If the energy deposited into the electrons of the target surface is sufficiently high, more than one electron can be emitted. Ion induced emission of electrons is essential in many technical plasma devices as an important source for generating further ions, including magnetron sputtering sources. In a recent study, Raggl et al. [33] investigated the plasma parameters during direct current magnetron sputtering of molybdenum targets made by different manufacturing processes. A significantly enhanced electron density was found for the target with the smallest grain size. Differences in electron densities during magnetron sputtering have a pronounced impact on the performance of sputtering targets used in industrial applications since the deposition rate is governed by the sputtering yield. Higher electron densities result in more ions that can sputter more efficiently the target. Raggl et al. proposed that a different ion induced electron emission yield \u03b3 is the reason for the observed target dependent electron density [33]. In order to shed light onto this hypothesis, a new instrument has been designed and constructed to measure \u03b3 with high spatial resolution. For targets with a grain size in the millimeter regime the IEEY of individual grains with different orientation can be measured as well.  For singly-charged projectile ions, as used in the present study, the ion induced electron emission yield \u03b3 can be determined by measuring the current of the projectile ions and the current of the emitted electrons: \u03b3=Ie/Ii It has to be considered that the current, measured on the target, is the sum on the incoming projectile current and the outgoing electron current. Spatial resolution of ion beams below 50\u00a0nm has been achieved for kinetic energies in the several ten keV energy range [3,34]. However, the energy range of interest for magnetron sputtering is a few 100\u00a0eV only. In combination with the required high current densities for efficient sputter cleaning of the target, the resulting high ion density leads to space charging which inevitably increases the spot size of a focused ion beam. The design of our instrument, schematically shown in Fig. 1 , is similar to a previously published setup by Choi at al. [25]. However, important differences will be explained below. Ions are formed by electron ionization in an ion source with a similar design as a hot-cathode pressure gauge. Electrons are emitted from a heated filament and accelerated to a cylindrically shaped grid that is kept at a potential 120\u00a0V positive with respect to the filament. Thereby, the electrons ionize argon inside the grid close to the maximum of the electron ionization cross section [35,36]. In contrast, Choi at al. [25] accelerate the electrons from a heated filament into the direction of the ion beam. The potential of the region where the electrons can ionize rare gas atoms is ill-defined which reduces the ionization efficiency and leads to a wide distribution of the kinetic energy of the ions. In the present setup the ions are extracted from the opening at the bottom of the grid by a weak penetrating field which guarantees a narrow kinetic energy spread of the ion beam. The ions are accelerated and focused by a set of electrostatic lenses to the target surface. The beam is collimated by a 0.5\u00a0mm aperture that also shields the electron collector from the incoming ion beam. The width and shape of the ion beam at the surface was determined by measuring the current on a 0.03\u00a0mm diameter wire that was mechanically moved across the ion beam in\u00a0x\u00a0and y-direction. Fig. 2 shows this measurement and the resulting ion beam profile. The full width at half maximum of the ion beam is 240\u00a0\u00b5m. This is about three times the beam width stated by Choi et al. [25]. Deconvolution with a. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Gaussian profile corresponding to the width of the wire does only reduce the measured curves insignificantly, i.e., to 238\u00a0\u00b5m. Choi et al. [25] used a pair of deflectors to move the ion beam across the target surface. Thereby, the impact angle is reduced from 90\u00b0 at the center to smaller values off the beam axis. In the present case, a piezo stage (Physik Instrumente \u201cPI Q-521.34U\u201d, bidirectional repeatability 50\u00a0nm) controls the target position. The whole stage is insulated from the target and kept on ground. It is fitted into a vacuum chamber pumped by a turbo molecular pump (Pfeiffer HiPace 700) and an oil free rotary vane pump. The base pressure is 5.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 Pa. The argon can be inserted by a gas pressure controller (pressurecontrolsolutions.nl) which is driven by a PID control loop. The feedback is taken from the analog signal of the pressure gauge (Pfeiffer IKR 251). The valve system can be operated via PC. The experiment was designed with a CAD software (Solidworks) and the file was taken as an input to simulate the flightpath of the argon ions with a computer software (Simion 8.1). The impact energy was set to 420\u00a0eV. By collision with the surface, secondary electrons are ejected from the surface and get accelerated to the Faraday cup that is biased 10\u00a0V positive relative to the surface. With two picoampere meters RBD 9103, the currents on the target surface and on the Faraday cup are measured every 500\u00a0ms for typically 150\u00a0s. Both currents exhibit a temporal behavior that can be fitted by exponential curves (see Fig. 3 a). Impurities like adsorption layers of water, hydrocarbons or metal-oxides on the surface will be removed by the projectile ion beam. During this time, the values of both currents drop asymptotically to the values of the pure surface material. After some time, these asymptotic values can be determined by exponential fits to the recorded data. The ion induced electron emission yield determined from the corresponding current values (see Fig. 3b) exhibits also a clear exponential decay which corresponds to an asymptotic value that would be reached after longer irradiation times. This asymptotic value \u03b30 can also be determined via exponential curves fitted to the data. Most of the time, \u03b3 decreases exponentially with the irradiation time (see Fig. 3b), which agrees well with the removal of a thin oxide layer [19,37] or an adsorbate film from a metal surface. The accuracy of \u03b30 increases with the measurement time. Reliable results could be achieved for irradiation times as low as 40\u00a0s. However, after an irradiation of typically 150\u00a0s, the target surface is moved by the two-dimensional linear piezo stage to the next spot of the surface. Andrianova et al. observed a strong dependence of the IEEY for glassy carbon materials on the temperature and ion current density [38]. Pronounced jumps of \u03b3(T) are assigned to a reduced annealing temperature for increasing current density. In the present study, the ion energy is a factor 100 and the current density almost five orders of magnitude lower than in ref [38]. Thus, we expect that under the present conditions, radiation induced defects and their annealing will be of less importance. Furthermore, Andrianova et al. did not observe this effect for other carbon-based materials [38]. The setup is controlled by a self-written software. For the user interface open frameworks based on HTML5, CSS and JavaScript are used, so it can run on every modern internet browser in the same network. Requests from the user interface are handled by a python-based web server using the Django framework. Communication to measurement devices and power sources is done via USB and RS-232 serial connections. For each position of the linear stages, data points are truncated by the first 10 values to exclude influences of the moving stage and possible setting of the pico-ammeters. The resulting points are fitted by an exponential decay function (see Fig. 3b). If the decay rate is not in a reasonable range, which happens in less than 1% of the cases, \u03b30 is determined from a median fit of the last third of the measured current values. The deviation from the asymptotic value of this approximation is less than 2%. The \u03b30 value of a corresponding position on the target surface results in a color-coded pixel of a map of the ion induced electron emission yield of the target surface. A stainless-steel surface was cleaned with Piranha solution (50:50 v/v solution of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and concentrated sulfuric acid 95\u201398%(H2SO4), both obtained from Sigma Aldrich). An image of the Tyrolian heraldic eagle was cut from an adhesive film using a laser CNC cutter and glued to the clean stainless-steel surface. The target surface was then loaded into a PVD sputter coater (safematic CCU-010) and a 50\u00a0nm thick Au layer was applied starting from a sputtering target (Au 99.99%). (The layer thickness was measured using the built-in quartz microbalance. By pulling off the eagle shaped adhesive film, an eagle made of stainless steel was surrounded by a 50\u00a0nm thick Au layer. SEM images of the target sample were measured utilizing a Raith Nanofabrication eLine Plus instrument. The optical images were taken with a reflected light microscope Leica ZG APO with a Leica DFC 420 Camera. The individually recorded partial areas were put together to form an image using the panorama photo stitcher software Hugin. XPS was performed with a Thermo MultiLab 2000 spectrometer with an alpha 110 hemispherical analyzer (Thermo Electron) [39] in the constant analyzer energy mode (surveys with pass energy 100\u00a0eV, energy resolution 2\u00a0eV; detailed spectra with pass energy 25\u00a0eV, energy resolution 0.8\u00a0eV). A twin crystal monochromator provided Al K\u03b1 radiation (1486.6\u00a0eV) with a focus of 650 \u00b5m in diameter. After background subtraction, the areas of the detected XPS core-level peaks were used to calculate the atomic concentration (at. %) of each constituent, taking into account the analyzer\u2019s transmission function and the sensitivity factors of the elements.  Fig. 4 a) shows an optical microscope image of the complete target. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "surface and Fig. 4b) an optical microscope image with 16 times magnification of a section of the right wing of the eagle, indicated by the red rectangle in a). At the border between the gold covered section and the region that was covered with the adhesive film, additional material most likely from the glue is found. In the photo it appears as a bright rim and in the microscope image as a dark region. In order to obtain more information on the film structure and the border region of the gold film, images with a scanning electron microscope were taken at various magnifications and shown in Fig. 5 . SEM images of the right wing of the eagle and enlarged sections of the gold-steel transition region. The gold film is not completely covering the steel substrate and exhibits holes and scratches. The removal of the adhesive film was leading the ruptures and backfolding of the gold film and some additional impurities, most likely from the glue. For a chemical analysis, XPS scans were taken at various positions of the sample. The spot size of the Al K\u03b1 X-ray beam (1486.6\u00a0eV) was focused to a diameter of 0.65\u00a0mm, which enabled the detailed chemical analysis of the gold film (Fig. 6 a), the eagle shaped stainless-steel region (Fig. 6b), and of the border regions (Fig. 6c). Four sections where selected that cover the region where specific XPS peaks for the elements Au, C, O and Fe can be found. The gold film shows a clear peak of the Au4f and its spin\u2013orbit component at 84\u00a0eV and 87.7\u00a0eV, respectively. Much less gold can be seen at the border region (b) and even less at the stainless-steel region (c). Except for the border region, the well-known C1s peaks for C C bonding and C O bonding at 284.8\u00a0eV and 288.5\u00a0eV can be resolved. At the transition region from the gold to the stainless-steel region (b), an intense peak is observed that is shifted towards lower binding energy. Nevertheless, this measurement confirms our assumption that residues of the glue from the adhesive film are present in this region. The presence of the iron Fe2p peaks (metallic iron at 706.7\u00a0eV and Fe2O3 at 710.8\u00a0eV, as well as their spin\u2013orbit components with a \u0394metal of 13.1\u00a0eV) at the gold film (a) indicates that the 50\u00a0nm thick film is not covering the stainless-steel surface completely. The O1s peak at 530\u00a0eV binding energy can be assigned to metal oxides, i.e., Fe2O3 and the peak at 531.7\u00a0eV binding energy matches perfectly organic C O. During a 227-hour measurement, the ion induced electron emission yield \u03b3 has been measured for the center region of the target surface (13.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016\u00a0mm) with a step width of 0.2\u00a0mm. The resulting color coded \u03b3 values are shown in Fig. 7 . A more detailed scan of two sections, indicated by red rectangles were measured with a step width 0.1\u00a0mm. As expected, a different value of \u03b3 is measured for the gold and stainless-steel surface with only very small deviations. Scratches and holes in the gold film are also confirmed by this measurement. The border region of the gold film that appears very bright in the photo and dark in the optical and electron microscope image exhibits the lowest ion induced electron emission yield. This agrees well with organic material as indicated by the XPS analysis. At an impact energy of 420\u00a0eV the dominant mechanism for ion induced electron emission upon Ar+ collisions is potential emission [29]. The average \u03b3 value for the gold film of 0.107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006. This is more than twice the value determined by Lakits et al. for polycrystalline gold irradiated with Ar+ at 400\u00a0eV, which is 0.04 [29]. A possible explanation is the presence of doubly-charged argon ions in our projectile ion beam. The average \u03b3 value for the eagle shaped stainless-steel part of the surface is 0.069\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005 and for the glue covered parts of the target 0.023\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005. A polycrystalline Si target with a grain size of a few mm was used to probe a possible ion induced electron emission dependence on the crystal orientation. The sample was cut from a polycrystalline silicon sheet obtained from Herbert Arnold GmbH & Co.KG, used for solar cell production. The root-mean-squared roughness was determined via AFM (Naio AFM, Nanosurf AG) measurements at various positions of the sample to be 0.9\u00a0\u00b5m. Fig. 8 a) shows a photo of a 12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0mm2 region of the sample and the differently colored regions might be assigned to different grains with different orientation. In Fig. 8b) a color-coded plot of the ion induced electron emission yield for the same region is shown. The \u03b3 values range from 0.05 (yellow) to 0.08 (blue-green) with an average value of 0.065\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016 for the selected region. The structures clearly visible in the optical image cannot be seen in the ion induced electron emission yield. However, a clear pattern is also observed in Fig. 8b) which could be exactly reproduced during a second 2d-scan of the surface. A scanning electron microscope image of the very same sample (Fig. 8c) shows the ion induced electron emission yield for electrons colliding with 25\u00a0keV with the silicon target. The agreement between the two images that represent ion induced electron emission upon Ar+ and electron bombardment is much better then with the optical image (Fig. 8a). Please note that the scanning electron microscope image nicely shows the scanning pattern of the Ar+ ion beam. According to the literature the sputtering efficiency depends on the crystal orientation [40]. The present results indicate that the grain size dependent electron densities determined by Raggl et al. [33] is not the result of the crystal orientation, but on the chemical composition, such as oxidation or adsorbed species. With decreasing grain size, the relative amount of grain boundaries increases. Oxidation of a surface preferentially happens at grain boundaries and the ion induced electron emission yield for metal oxides is typically larger than for pure metallic surfaces. This agrees very well with the oxygen concentrations determined by Raggl. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "et al. [33] for their molybdenum targets. The oxygen content of their samples was inversely proportional to the average grain size.  With a new experimental setup, the ion induced electron emission yield upon Ar+ impact at 420\u00a0eV onto a surface can be determined with a special resolution of 240\u00a0\u00b5m. The current density as well as the kinetic energy of the projectile beam is comparable to DC magnetron sputtering with argon. When irradiating a new target position, the ion induced electron emission yield exhibits typically an exponential time dependence which can be associated with sputter cleaning of the surface and the removal of an adsorbate layer. From the temporal dependence, a steady-state value can be determined which is highly reproducible. The method was thoroughly tested with a gold covered stainless steel sample. The ion induced electron emission yields determined at various regions of the surface agree well with the elemental analysis performed with XPS. In case of a polycrystalline silicon wafer with an average grain size of about 5\u00a0mm, the ion induced electron emission yield does not depend on the crystal orientation and also the grain boundaries cannot be resolved. The same is also true for the ion induced electron emission yield upon 25\u00a0keV electron bombardment utilizing a scanning electron microscope. The electron density in the plasma of magnetron sputtering is an important parameter that determines the sputtering yield, which is strongly influenced by the ion induced electron emission yield of the sputtering target. Whereas Raggl et al. recently demonstrated a grain size dependence of the ion induced electron emission yield for differently produced molybdenum sputtering targets [32], our results indicate that both the chemical composition of the surface itself as well as possible oxide and adsorbate layers also have a strong effect on the ion induced electron emission yield and thus the sputtering yield.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2013.03.175.txt", "paper": ["During the last decade, many new materials have been involved in the electronic device technology. Particularly, the stainless-steel (SS) foil has been tested instead of the rigid glass substrate in the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells technology . The advantage of SS foil substrates is the flexibility that allows one to use the roll-to-roll manufacturing and thus, to reduce the device cost . At the same time, the main drawback of the SS substrate is the pure adhesion to various functional layers deposited above and namely, to Mo or Mo/Ti layers . Therefore, the problem of adhesion for the SS foil surface is an important task to be solved for improving solar cell characteristics. From Refs. , it is known that the properties of both organic and inorganic surfaces can be modified by plasma treatment. The meaning of \u201cmodification\u201d includes many effects such as the change of surface morphology, roughness and/or chemical composition while the properties of treated (or etched, in the case of chemically active plasmas) surface can be very different compared with both original surface and bulk material. Particularly, the parameter of our interest \u2013 the adhesion ability \u2013 is linked with the free surface energy that should be optimized to a maximum value. At the same time, free surface energy depends on both surface roughness and chemical state . Until now, there are no works devoted to the investigation of the SS modification characteristics and mechanisms in both noble gas and chemically active gas plasmas. There are only some occasional mentions that this material is quite stable to the halogen-containing plasma exposure, so that it is frequently used for plasma etching equipment manufacturing . Therefore, the lack of data on the SS degradation and modification in chemical and physical etching processes retards the improvement of the solar cell technology. The aim of present work was to investigate the SS etching (degradation) mechanism in the Cl2/Ar inductively coupled plasmas as well as to find out the interconnections between plasma parameters and etched surface characteristics. The Cl2/Ar mixing ratio was chosen as the single variable because it provides the clear transition between chemical and physical etching pathways and thus, allows one to analyze the features and the impacts of these principal regimes. For this purpose, a combination of plasma diagnostics, plasma modeling and surface investigation methods was applied.  Etching and plasma diagnostic experiments were performed in a planar inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) reactor. The reactor had a cylindrical chamber (r = 16 cm) made from anodized aluminum and a 5-turn copper coil located above a 10-mm-thick horizontal quartz window. The coil was connected to a 13.56-MHz power supply. The distance (l) between the window and the bottom electrode that was used as a substrate holder was 12.8 cm. The bottom electrode was connected to a 12.56-MHz power supply in order to maintain a negative DC bias voltage. The experiments were performed with fixed gas pressure (p = 6 mTorr) input power (W inp = 1000 W) and bias power (W dc = 350 W). The Cl2/Ar mixing ratio was varied from 0 to 100% Ar by adjusting the partial flow rates of pure gases within the total flow rate of 50 sccm. The SS samples with the size of 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm and the thickness of about 100 \u03bcm were placed at the center of the bottom electrode. The temperature of the bottom electrode was stabilized at 17 \u00b0C using a water-flow cooling system. The SS etched depths were measured using a surface profiler (Alpha-step 500, Tencor). For this purpose, we developed the line striping of the photoresist (AZ1512, positive) with the line width/spacing ratio of 2 \u03bcm/2 \u03bcm. The SS surface morphology was investigated using the atomic force microscope (AFM-XE100, Park system). The data on mean surface roughness were obtained using the software supplied by the equipment manufacturer. Free surface energy was calculated through the Owens\u2013Wendt equation . For this purpose, the measurements of contact angles with polar (de-ionized water) and non-polar (CH2I2) liquids were provided using the drop shape analysis system (DSA-100, KRUSS). Plasma diagnostics were performed using a double Langmuir probe (DLP2000, Plasmart Inc.). The probes were installed through the viewport on the sidewall of the reactor chamber, at a point that was 5.7 cm above the bottom electrode and centered in a radial direction. The treatment of I\u2013V curves to obtain electron temperature (T e) and total positive ion density (n +) was carried out using the software supplied by the equipment manufacturer. Calculations were performed based on Johnson and Malter's double probe theory and by using the Allen-Boyd-Reynolds approximation, the ion-saturation current density was applied. In order to obtain the data on plasma parameters and fluxes of plasma active species, we used a simplified global (zero-dimensional) model with a Maxwellian approximation for the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) . The experimental data on T e and n + were directly applied as input model parameters. The simultaneous solutions of (1) the steady-state balanced equations for neutral and charged species and (2) the quasi-neutrality conditions for both bulk plasma and plasma\u2013surface interface provided the data on volume-averaged densities of the rest charged species (electrons, negative ions), neutral ground-state species (Cl2 and Cl) as well as the fluxes of all these species on the treated surface. The details about the algorithm, reaction set and the rest input data are given in Refs. .  When a combination of chemically active gas and noble gas is used for the material etching, the behavior of the etching rate with operating parameters as well as the properties of the etched surface depends strongly on the contributions of chemical and physical etching pathways. Among the main SS surface components (15.24% Fe, 9.59% Cr, 2.99% Mn, 25.3% O, 40.29% C, 2.15% N and 3.44% Si), there are no metals forming the volatile chlorides at near-to-room temperatures. This directly follows from the analysis of boiling points (T bp) for corresponding compounds: T bp = 1023 \u00b0C for FeCl2, 326 \u00b0C for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "FeCl3, 1300 \u00b0C for CrCl3, >600 \u00b0C for CrCl4, 1190 \u00b0C for MnCl2 and 57.6 \u00b0C for SiCl4 . Note that the formation of SiCl4 in the crystal structures is retarded by the low penetration of the Cl atoms inside the lattice, so that the much lower volatile SiCl2 is the dominant reaction product . As a result, the spontaneous etching of the SS surface at temperatures below 100 \u00b0C can be neglected due to the formation of the quite stable protective layer composed from the non-volatile metal chlorides. That is why the SS is a widely used material for plasma etching reactors and pumping equipment working with the chlorine-containing plasmas . The etching of the SS surface takes place only with the strong ion bombardment which removes the reaction products and thus, provides the development of chemical reaction. Therefore, the SS etching mechanism in the Cl2/Ar plasma can be pre-determined as the ion-assisted chemical reaction. Fig. 1 illustrates the influence of gas mixing ratio on the SS etching rates as well as on the negative ds bias at W dc = const. It can be seen that, as the Ar fraction increases from 0 to 100%, the SS etching rate decreases monotonically in the range of 41.3\u20131.6 nm/min, i.e. by more than 25 times. This allows one to make an assertion that, for the given process conditions, the chemical etching pathway is more effective than the physical one. However, an exact conclusion on the SS etching mechanism as well as the further analysis of the etched surface characteristics requires the data on plasma parameters and fluxes of active species. The detailed analysis of plasma parameters and chemistry in Cl2/Ar ICP has been performed in our works . Below, we would like to focus the attention only on the key issues which are important for the purpose of this research. An increase in T e with increasing Ar mixing ratio (2.5\u20132.9 eV for 0\u2013100% Ar, see Fig. 2(a)) is in agreement with published data and is connected with the lower electron energy losses for the excitation and ionization of Ar atoms . This results in increasing rate coefficients for electron impact processes, and mainly for the high-threshold ionizations. Accordingly, the growth of measured n + (1.1 \u00d7 1011\u20137.0 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 for 0\u2013100% Ar) and model-predicted n e (4.9 \u00d7 1010\u20137.0 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 for 0\u2013100% Ar) is associated with an increase in the total ionization rate as well as with the change in the total charge balance due to decreasing negative ion density. Both total flux of positive ions \u0393 + (3.5 \u00d7 1015\u20133.7 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22122 s\u22121 for 0\u2013100% Ar) and the ion saturation current density J + (2.5\u201317.9 mA/cm2 for 0\u2013100% Ar, see Fig. 2(b)) follow the behavior of n + which is also supported by increasing ion Bohm velocity. From Refs. , it can be understood that the efficiency of ion bombardment can be generally characterized by m i(\u03b5 i)1/2 \u0393 + where m i is the effective ion mass, and \u03b5 i is the ion bombardment energy. High dissociation degrees for Cl2 molecules (nCl/nCl2=5\u201338for0\u201380%Ar) provide the domination of Cl+ over Cl2 +, so that m i \u2248 const for 0\u2013100% Ar because of mCl+\u2248mAr+. The ion bombardment energy is \u03b5 i \u2248 e|\u2212U dc \u2212 U f|, where U f \u2248 6 T e is the floating potential , and U dc is the negative dc bias from an external power source (Fig. 1). In our case, the variation of (\u03b5 i)1/2 (19.2\u201314.2 eV1/2 for 0\u2013100% Ar) is much weaker than that for \u0393 + and thus, does not influence principally the behavior of (\u03b5 i)1/2 \u0393 +. Therefore, the impact of the physical etching pathway on the modification of the SS surface can be characterized by the \u0393 + only. Though the addition of Ar increases the dissociation efficiency for Cl2 molecules (k dis n e = 795\u20136310 s\u22121 for 0\u201380% Ar), this effect is completely compensated by decreasing nCl2. As a result, both Cl atom density (n Cl = 1.4 \u00d7 1014\u20133.7 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22123 for 0\u201380% Ar) and Cl atom flux (\u0393 Cl = 1.8 \u00d7 1018\u20131.9 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 s\u22121 for 0\u201380% Ar) follow the Cl2 fraction in the Cl2/Ar mixture. Generally, the efficiency of the chemical etching pathway can be y characterized by \u03b3 R \u0393 Cl , where \u03b3 R is the reaction probability. Since, in our case, \u03b3 R \u2248 const because of constant surface temperature, the impact of the chemical etching pathway on the modification of the SS surface is controlled by the \u0393 + only. From the above data, one can conclude that the parameter \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + (so-called, neutral/charged ratio) directly characterizes the balance between chemical and physical impacts on the SS surface. In order to figure out the SS etching mechanism, it is reasonable to analyze the correlations of the SS etching rate with both \u0393 Cl and \u0393 + as well as the interconnections between neutral/charged ratio and the SS surface characteristics. The comparison of Figs. 1 and 2(b) show that the behavior of the SS etching rate contradicts with \u0393 +, but follows \u0393 Cl. Such situation formally corresponds to the reaction-rate-limited etching regime. In our case, such regime can take place only if the ion bombardment provides enough cleaning of the SS surface from the low volatile reaction products. Particularly, from Ref. , it can be understood that the reaction-rate-limited regime in Cl2/Ar ICP under the close range of operating conditions starts when the fraction of free (not covered by the reaction product) surface exceeds 50\u201360%. Accordingly, the ion bombardment energy (and thus, W dc) seems to be the key parameter determining the regime of the whole SS etching process for the fixed Cl2/Ar mixture composition. From Figs. 3 and 4(a) , it can be seen that an increase in Ar fraction and a decrease in neutral/charge ratio causes a sufficient decrease in surface roughness. Really, the mean roughness (MR) derived. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "from the AFM images falls from 83.9 nm in pure Cl2 plasma down to 19.7 nm in pure Ar plasma. The fact that the MR value increases with the \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + ratio suggests that this effect has a chemical nature. In our opinion, it can be connected with, at least, two reasons. First, since an increase in \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + is also escorted by increasing SS etching rate, the re-deposition of etch by-products is rather expectable. An indirect proof is that the MR and the SS etching rate demonstrate a not bad correlation (Fig. 4(a)). Here, the saturations of both etching rate and MR toward higher \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + values may results from the saturation of the treated surface by the reaction products up to the limit determined by the total amount of active surface sites. Similar effects have repeatedly been reported for many materials used in micro- and nano-electronics technology . And secondly, the domination of the chemical etching pathway at high \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + ratios can result in the non-uniform surface degradation because of different partial etching (gasification) rates for SS components. In this case, the saturation of MR may be attributed to the limited penetration depth of Cl atoms inside the lattice. We also believe that both proposed mechanism do work together, and their contributions cannot be divided accurately within this study. From Refs. , it is known that many surface characteristics (chemical activity, wettability, adhesion ability) are closely linked with the free surface energy (\u03c3 T). Speaking simply, the higher \u03c3 T values correspond to \u201cactive\u201d surface while the lower \u03c3 T allows one to speak about an \u201cinert\u201d surface. From Fig. 4(b), it can be seen that an increase in \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + ratio causes an increase in both polar \u03c3 P (29.3\u201337.0 mN/m, i.e. by 1.3 times for 0\u2013100% Cl2) and dispersive \u03c3 D (0.2\u20139.3 mN/m, i.e. by 50 times for 0\u2013100% Cl2) components of surface energy, so that \u03c3 T = \u03c3 P + \u03c3 D = 29.5\u201346.4 mN/m. The values of \u03c3 P and \u03c3 D for the original untreated SS samples are 24.1 mN/m and 0.2 mN/m, respectively. In our opinion, the change in \u03c3 P directly results from increasing MR while a much smaller relative growth of \u03c3 D can be associated with the change in chemical composition of etched surface. Particularly, since \u03c3 D is generally determined by polar groups located on the surface, an increase in this parameter may result from increasing density of the original groups (mainly O-containing groups as the SS surface components and adsorbed gases) and/or from the formation of new groups with higher electron affinities. In our opinion, the last mechanism looks more reasonable. Probably, an increase in \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + ratios causes the enrichment of the etched surface by the Cl-containing compounds through both re-deposition of etching by-products and localization of Cl atoms in the non-volatile metal chlorides. The saturations of \u03c3 P and \u03c3 D toward high neutral/charged rations may be connected with the same reasons as was proposed for etching rate and surface roughness. Fig. 5 shows also that a not bad linear correlation between free surface energy and surface roughness takes place.  In this work, we carried out an investigation of SS etching behavior and surface characteristics using the Cl2/Ar inductively coupled plasma. It was found that an increase in Ar fraction in the Cl2/Ar plasma from 0 to 100% at fixed gas pressure, input power and bias power results in decreasing SS etching (degradation) rate (41.3\u20131.5 nm/min), mean surface roughness MR (84\u201320 nm) and free surface energy (46.4\u201329.5 mN/m). The data on plasma parameters and fluxes of plasma active species were obtained from a combination of plasma diagnostics by Langmuir probes and plasma modeling. It was shown that the SS etching kinetics correspond to the reaction-rate-limited etching regime while the maximum values of MR and \u03c3 T correspond to higher \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + ratios. Also, the linear correlation between \u03c3 T and MR was obtained. All these allows one to conclude that treatment of the SS at higher \u0393 Cl/\u0393 + ratios (an thus, at a domination of chemical etching pathway) provides more \u201cactive\u201d surface and, probably, improves the adhesion characteristics for deposited layers.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Up to present, such a considerable number of 2D crystals has been successfully created that the family of 2D materials could span the broad spectrum of solid properties ranging from insulators to superconductors [1]. This leads to a variety of major applications covering electronic and optoelectronic devices, biosensors, and energy storage and generation, to name a few [2,3]. Nevertheless, intensive attempts to fabricate new 2D materials remain on-going in order to achieve novel properties for enhancing certain functionalities. More new 2D materials will be expectedly discovered in the near future [4]. As an alternative route, integration of existing ones has emerged as an innovative paradigm to produce 2D hybrids with unusual properties not available in the isolated components [5]. The occurrence of new features stems from the superposition, intersection or cancelation of intrinsic quantum properties of the individuals [4]. Distinct 2D crystals can be assembled by two basic approaches, i.e., either lateral or vertical combination. The former requires the constituents to be lattice-matched, consequently limiting a number of eligible heterostructures. On the other hand, the latter does not necessitate the lattice-matching constrain because such heterostructures rely on the controllable vertical stacking of dissimilar layers between which weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction is primarily responsible for aggregation [6]. This scenario allows enormous combination of possibilities and the resulted hybrids are generally regarded as van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) [4]. The pioneering demonstration of vdWHs is fabrication of the graphene transistor on a BN substrate where the resultant transistor exhibited the improved performance (i.e., higher carrier mobility, reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity) as compared to the traditional devices on SiO2 [7]. Afterwards, generic vdWHs have become a feasible platform for both exploring fundamental physics and tailoring electronic and optical properties of 2D materials [4]. Notable examples include ballistic transport at a micrometer scale in graphene-BN heterostructures [8], strong light-matter interaction in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)/graphene [9], valley-polarized excitons in WSe2-MoSe2 vdWHs [10], graphene/MoS2 tunnelling transistors [11], ultra-responsive photodetectors made from hybrid BN-2D black phosphorene [12,13]. In particular, the concept of vdWHs can resolve the so-called air-degradation of two-dimensional phosphorus [12,14]. Phosphorus can be found in various polymorphs (e.g., white, red, violet and black) of which black phosphorus is the most stable form. Although it was discovered over a century ago, mechanical exfoliation to become the few-layer form (named black phosphorene or BlackP hereafter) was recently realised in 2014 with the demonstration of the ambipolar field effect ensuing the exceptional performance in field effect transistors (FETs) [15\u201317]. Unlike semi-metallic graphene, BlackP is a direct-gap semiconductor enabling the ultra-high drain current on-off ratio (~105) [15\u201317]. Its gap size also covers visible to near-infrared light spectrum [18] and it is adjustably thickness-dependent, ranging from 0.3\u202feV in bulk to around 1.73\u202feV in monolayer [19]. The topology of the direct band gap remains preserved regardless of thickness, unlike in TMDCs. Furthermore, two-dimensional phosphorus possesses the greater electronic transport (carrier mobility of 1000\u202fcm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 at room temperature) which is also directionally anisotropic along the zigzag and arm-chair directions [16,20]. These exceptional features render BlackP to be an appropriate material for high-performance electronics and optoelectronic devices such as FETs, ultra-sensitive photodetectors, thermoelectric generators, and solar cells [19]. However, BlackP rapidly degrades to an insulating phosphorus oxide within a few hours under ambient conditions, consequently losing its overall attractiveness [14,21,22]. The severe oxidation process is basically attributed to the intrinsic wave-like crystal morphology and sp3 bonding character [23]. Each phosphorus atom is covalently bonded with 3 neighbouring atoms, leaving the lone-paired electrons to be chemically prone to oxidation. This oxidative degradation can be circumvented by making vdWHs in which the atomically smooth and air-insusceptible BN is exploited as the protective layers. The use of BN is advantageous because of being a large-gap insulator (5.90\u202feV) [24] with relatively less amount of dangling bonds and charge traps [7]. As a result, the environmental stability of BlackP in BN-BlackP vdWHs is prolonged yet its electronic properties remains unperturbed due to the weak vdW interaction [25]. Despite being the capping layer, one can further anticipate the novelty of BN-BlackP vdWHs when the protective material is substitutionally doped by C to form new BCxN-BlackP (x\u202f=\u202f0, 2, and 6) hybrids. This concept is inspired by the compositional dependence on electronic properties of ternary borocarbonitrides (BCxN) of which their band gaps get reduced gradually upon the increasing carbon concentration (from 5.90\u202feV in BN [24] to 0.98\u202feV in BC6N) [26\u201329]. Hence, such vdW heterostructures of BCxN and BlackP can be promising for two reasons, i.e., (i) retaining the air-stability of BlackP and (ii) permitting freedom to tune the electronic and optoelectronic properties of these vdWHs. The latter point is an intriguing space for further elucidation to enable targeted applications. This work aims at unravelling the electronic and optical properties of BCxN-BlackP (x\u202f=\u202f0, 2, and 6) bilayer van der Waals hybrids by means of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The key fundamental properties, including band structures, chemical bonding, band alignments, and the variation of band offsets under the influence of external electric field of these hybrids are studied. Furthermore, the prospective exploitation of these vdWHs in solar cell applications are examined through computing the absorbance and subsequently estimating the solar power conversion efficiency. The findings manifest that the band alignment of BCxN-BlackP vdWHs are the function of carbon concentration and the external electric field (i.e., the tunable transition from type I to type II band offset at the appropriate concentration and field strength). In particular, type-II offset in BC6N/BlackP can intensify solar absorption in the majority infrared regime, resulting in the exceptional photovoltaic performance.  Modelling of BCxN-BlackP bilayer vdWHs was based on the original unit cells of BN, BCxN [26], and BlackP. The cells of BN and BCxN are hexagonal, whereas that of BlackP is orthorhombic. However, nominal rectangular unit cells were created to circumvent the lattice. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "dissimilarity as shown in Fig. 1 (a\u2013d) with the orthorhombic first Brillouin zone shown in Fig. 1(e). The lattice constants of the unit cells representing (BN/BlackP), (BC2N/BlackP), and (BC6N/BlackP) heterostructures are (a\u202f=\u202f4.571\u202f\u00c5, b\u202f=\u202f9.927\u202f\u00c5, c\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u00c5), (a\u202f=\u202f4.519\u202f\u00c5, b\u202f=\u202f9.991\u202f\u00c5, c\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u00c5), (a\u202f=\u202f4.593\u202f\u00c5, b\u202f=\u202f9.901\u202f\u00c5, c\u202f=\u202f30\u202f\u00c5) as displayed in Fig. 1(f\u2013h). Although these cells internally impose the infinitesimal in-plane strain to BCxN and BlackP sheets, the use of such lattice parameters is physically valid. This is because the computed band alignments of isolated BCxN and BlackP in these sets of rectangular cells resemble those of the original cells. Note that the fictitious strain is an unavoidable theoretical artifact in building vdWHs to minimise the strain. However, it is not required in real devices owing to the weak vdW interaction between the monolayers [30]. The optimal interlayer distances between the monolayers were estimated by fitting the binding energy Eb, Eb=EBCxN-BlackP-EBCxN+EBlackP, as a function of the interlayer distance r to Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, ULJ=4\u03b5\u03c3r12-\u03c3r6, where \u03b5 and \u03c3 are the fitting parameters. The first term in LJ potential accounts for repulsion, whereas the second term describes attraction. Different stacking patterns of each BCxN-BlackP were considered and the structures with the lowest binding energies have been subsequently chosen for further investigation. DFT-based ab-initio calculations were performed using VASP code [31]. The exchange correlation energy was treated by the gradient-corrected approximation according to Perdew Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism [32]. Weak vdW interaction between BCxN and BlackP sheets was considered by incorporating the pairwise dispersive correction in the Kohn-Sham energies using the DFT-D3 approach [33,34]. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was set to 500\u202feV. The first Brillouin zone was sampled by Monkhorst-Pack scheme with k-mesh of 15\u202f\u00d7\u202f7\u202f\u00d7\u202f1 and 17\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f\u00d7\u202f1 for structural optimisation and optical absorption, respectively. Structural optimisation was satisfactorily terminated when Hellmann-Feynman forces exerting on each atom were less than 10\u202fmeV/\u00c5. The tolerance of electronic self-consistency cycle was set to 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126 eV. The accurate determinations of band structures and optical absorption of the selected systems were carried out using hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional [35,36]. However, the findings presented here were obtained from PBE functional, unless stated otherwise.  Fig. 2 (a) shows the interlayer binding energies of vdWHs as a function of the interlayer spacing. The optimal distance of BN-BlackP is 3.53\u202f\u00c5 with a minimum binding energy of 25.95\u202fmeV/atom. These values are consistent with the reported theoretical findings in spite of the insignificant deviation inherited from the dissimilar approaches used to describe vdW forces [25,37]. The weak magnitude of binding energy and the long interlayer distance manifest the principal role of vdW interaction caused by the instantaneous dipole from charge fluctuation. The obtained fitting parameters \u03b5 and \u03c3 according to LJ formalism are 24.95\u202fmeV/atom and 2.95\u202f\u00c5, respectively [25]. This interlayer binding energy is slightly weaker than the measured value of graphite (30.4\u202fmeV/atom [38]), implying its relative exfoliation energy with respect to graphite. Furthermore, the binding energy as a function of the interlayer spacing allows us to estimate the elastic constant (C33) in the perpendicular direction of BN and BlackP interface using the following expression, C33=r0A\u22022Ebr\u2202r2, where r0 is the equilibrium interlayer distance, A represents the in-plane surface area of the vdWH supercell and Eb is the binding energy. The calculated C33 is 33.10 GPa, slightly less incompressible than that of graphite, 36.50 GPa [39]. The reason can be attributed to the fact that the wave-like geometry of BlackP results in the a large flexibility along both the horizontal and the vertical directions [25]. Meanwhile, the presence of substitutional carbon dopants in BN relatively decreases the interlayer distances, leading to the increase in binding energies despite the non-monotonic trend. The equilibrium distances (maximum binding energies) of BC2N-BlackP and BC6N-BlackP vdWHs amount to 3.37\u202f \u00c5 (\u221230.195\u202fmeV/atom) and 3.43\u202f\u00c5 (\u221227.860\u202fmeV/atom), respectively. The calculated binding energies are quantitatively comparable to that of graphite, reflecting that the peeling (exfoliation) energies of these hybrids are of nearly the same strength. The fitting parameters \u03b5 and \u03c3 of BC2N-BlackP (BC6N-BlackP) hybrid are \u221231.083 (\u221228.950) meV/atom and 2.79 (2.83) \u00c5, respectively. The estimated C33 elastic constant of BC2N-BlackP (BC6N-BlackP) hybrid is 42.70 (36.20) GPa, indicating that the addition of carbon atoms makes the vdWHs less compressible. Furthermore, Fig. 2(b) depicts the plane-average potential (Vave) which basically describes the combination of Hartree (VHartree), exchange-correlation (Vxc), and external (Vext) potentials. Apparently, there are potential drops across the interfaces to create the built-in electric fields between the constituent sheets, yielding the spontaneous polarisation [40]. These intrinsic fields are triggered by the fundamental differences in electronegativity of B (2.01), C (2.50), N (3.07) and P (2.06) atoms and they point from BlackP to BCxN resembling our previous work of BCxN-Blue phosphorene interface [41]. Hence, the excitonic behaviour of vdWHs (i.e., the optical properties) tends to differ from that of individual quasi-monolayer BlackP and BCxN due to the typically reduced dielectric screening in 2D materials [16]. Fig. 3 (a\u2013d) depicts the orbitally-resolved band structures of BlackP, BN, BC2N, and BC6N as calculated by PBE and HSE06 levels of theory. The band gap of BlackP by PBE (HSE06) is 0.91 (1.55) eV. The HSE06 gap agrees with the reported DFT calculations [25,42,43] and close to the experimental value of 1.73\u202f eV [44]. In particular, BlackP shows a direct-gap feature at \u0393. Both the valence and conduction band extrema are formed by P-3pz orbital where the band curvature (i.e., carrier effective masses) along \u0393-X greatly differs from that along \u0393-Y. This indicates that \u03c0 bands derived from interactions between P-3pz orbitals contribute to direction-dependence and exceptional carrier mobility of this 2D phosphorus. On the other hand, BN is a huge band gap (direct) insulator at K with the calculated gap of 4.65 (5.65) eV by PBE (HSE06), of which the HSE06 gap is slightly smaller than the experimental value of 5.91\u202feV [24]. The valence and conduction band edges are predominantly contributed by \u03c0 bands from N-2pz and B-2pz, respectively. The dispersion of conduction band along M-K is virtually flat. This scenario leads to the difficulty in unambiguously classifying BN as either a direct-gap. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "or an indirect-gap insulator owing to the influential role of immense excitonic binding energy in the absorption onset [24]. Meanwhile, it is found that substitutional doping of carbon in BN drastically reduces the gap. The band structure of BC2N attests the semiconducting character with a direct PBE (HSE06) gap of 1.60 (2.19) eV at the zone center. In particular, the edge states are \u03c3bands derived from the enhanced planar overlap between B-2(px\u202f+\u202fpy) and C-2(px\u202f+\u202fpy) for the valence band edge and N-2(px\u202f+\u202fpy) and C-2(px\u202f+\u202fpy) for the conduction band edge. This results in the significant drop in the gap at \u0393. Nevertheless, the band edges at K, like BN, still show \u03c0-character where the valence (conduction) band extremum is contributed by N-2pz (B-2pz). At higher doping concentration, BC6N possesses the cone-like direct PBE (HSE06) gap of 1.04 (1.51) eV at K, whereas its \u0393-gap is considerably greater. This is attributed to the fact that BC6N is in the heavily doped regime where its band structure approaches that of graphene. The HSE06 gap of BC6N suitably falls into the infrared region which is the majority of solar spectrum. Moreover, our spin-polarised calculations assure that BC2N and BC6N are nonmagnetic. This is because the simultaneous replacement of B and N sites by C atoms within the interaction length (around 10\u202f\u00c5) eradicates spin-splitting of the impurity states to adopt the S\u202f=\u202f0 configuration [45]. The band gaps of BCxN do not only drop with the increasing carbon concentration, but their band edge positions also get changed accordingly. This further motivates us to elucidate the band alignment when they actually form vdWHs with BlackP. Fig. 3(e\u2013f) show the PBE and HSE06 band alignment diagrams of the isolated BCxN and BlackP prior to forming vdWHs. The alignment is obtained by calculating the work functions of materials (W), W=Evac+EF, where Evac and EF represent the vacuum level and the Fermi energy, respectively. The diagrams imply that the formation of BN-BlackP vdWH yields straddling type-I band offset [25]. On the contrary, BCxN-BlackP composites adopt type-II band offset. The band alignments from PBE and HSE06 are similar despite the differences in the gaps and work functions, manifesting that relative band alignments are less functional dependent [46]. Notably, the valence band offsets between BlackP and BCxN are infinitesimal that the prominent interlayer couplings when forming vdWHs potentially alters the offsets. Fig. 4 (a\u2013c) show the projected band structures, the band alignment diagram, and the charge density of valence and conduction band edges of BCxN-BlackP vdWHs. It is evident that BN-BlackP and BC2N-BlackP hybrids form type-I band alignment, while BC6N-BlackP differently adopts type-II. Intriguingly, the band alignment of BC2N-BlackP vdWH differs from that in Fig. 3(e\u2013f). Moreover, the valence and conduction band edges of BC6N-BlackP are now populated by BlackP and BC6N, respectively, differing from the prior band positions in Fig. 3(e\u2013f). The valence bands of BlackP and BC6N in the vdWH now equalises because of the overlap among P-3pz, N-2pz, and C-2pz orbitals. In particular, BC6N-BlackP exhibits type-II offset at Y-point which is preferable for optoelectronics and photovoltaics because of the spontaneously spatial separation of electrons and holes [47,48]. Further calculations of band structure and band alignment by HSE06 also yield the similar band alignment despite the difference in the gap and the offset magnitude (the conduction band offset of 0.19\u202feV by PBE and 0.29eV by HSE06). It is intriguing to highlight that high hole mobility in BlackP remains preserved in the BC2N-BlackP and BC6N-BlackP heterobilayers, as their VBM are contributed by BlackP [60]. It should be emphasised that the band realignments of BC2N-BlackP and BC6N-BlackP vdWHs compared with those of their isolated components are because the presence of carbon atoms intensifies the charge transfer from BlackP to BCxN. This is apparently ascertained by the charge difference plot in Fig. 5 (a). There is charge accumulation (cyan) and depletion (yellow) on BCxN and BlackP, respectively, simply because of the differences in electronegativity. Consequently, the built-in electric field gets maximised and the band positions of BlackP and BC2N are shifted accordingly. Hence, we conclude that the built-in electric fields play a major role in the band alignment of vdWHs, especially the vdWHs constituted by the sheets with the striking difference in the electronegativities. Numerous studies have revealed that electronic properties of devices based on vdWHs are effectively gate-tunable (i.e., the application of back gate voltage) due to Stark effect [49,50]. The modulation of electronic and optical properties by the external electric field is beneficially reversible and non-invasive, unlike the irreversible chemical doping approach. Hence, it is intriguing to explore how BCxN-BlackP vdWHs respond to the perturbative electric field for the possible realisation of electronic devices. Fig. 5(b-c) display the charge differences of vdWHs under the influence of the positive and negative electric fields of \u00b10.5\u202feV/\u00c5 where the direction of positive electric field is +c and vice versa. The presence of perturbation clearly causes the spatial charge redistribution. Specifically, the positive electric field induces more charge transfer from BlackP to BCxN because the external field constructively superimposes on the built-in. Meanwhile, the negative field suppresses the charge transfer because the external field destructively reverses the built-in. More insights into the variation of band gap (Eg) of vdWHs as a function of the time independent electric field strength is shown in Fig. 5(d). Despite the different trends, the heterostructures undergo the semiconductor-to-metal transition at the same critical field magnitudes in both the directions, around \u22120.8 (+0.6) eV/\u00c5 for the negative (positive) bias. This is because their band gaps and Fermi energies of are nearly similar. Quantitatively, the PBE gaps (Fermi energies) of BN-BlackP, BC2N-BlackP, and BC6N-BlackP are 0.86 (\u22121.986), 0.98 (\u22121.896), and 0.85 (\u22121.986) eV, respectively. The phase transition facilitates the enormous tunnel current during the appropriate bias, whereas the current is comparatively less in the lack of bias, leading to the on-off ratio. In terms of the trends, the gap of BN-BlackP vdWH exhibits the plateau in the range \u22120.6 to +0.6\u202feV/\u00c5 where the band gap is field-independent. Unlike BN-BlackP, the reduction in band. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "gaps of BC2N-BlackP and BC6N-BlackP hybrids exhibits the asymmetric quadratic Stark effect regardless of the direction, resembling the gate tunability in few-layer black phosphorus [50] and BlackP-MoS2 vdWH [48]. The changes in the gaps of vdWHs under the influence of electric field rely on the positions of band edges. Fig. 6 shows the responsive trace of the band edges of BC2N-BlackP and BC6N-BlackP under the influence of the electric field from 0 to \u00b10.4\u202feV/\u00c5. The findings reveal that the frontier states behave differently, depending on the high-symmetry directions of the first Brillouin zone. The band edges of BlackP in all the vdWHs are not responsive to the field. On the other hand, the frontier states formed by BC2N and BC6N (i.e., 2pz orbitals of B, C, and N atoms) are sensitively shifted towards each other. As a result, the band alignment of BC2N-BlackP can be transformed from type-I to type-II at \u00b10.4\u202f eV/\u00c5. Likewise, type-II offset of BC6N-BlackP is converted into type-I at \u00b10.2\u202feV/\u00c5, regardless the field direction. The findings indicate that the tunability of both band gap and band alignment of BCxN-BlackP vdWHs is governed by the active responses of the 2pz orbitals from BCxN. The different responsiveness of the edge states of BC2N and BC6N compared with those of BlackP can be ascribed to the lifting degeneracy by the Stark effect. The greater responsiveness of the edge states of BC2N and BC6N is associated with their edges states which are formed by B-2pz and N-2pz and C-2pz orbitals, unlike the frontier states of BlackP which are derived from the combination of 3px, 3py, and 3pz. Consequently, the enhanced diffuse nature of the pz orbital readily facilitates greater charge redistribution (i. e., splitting of energy levels) [59]. This envisages the effective gate-tunability of these vdWHs as a building block in nanoelectronics. BC6N-BlackP vdWH exhibits type-II band offset that is feasible for spatial charge separation in the photovoltaic application. One can elucidate the performance of the photovoltaic device based on this vdWH by computing solar absorption. Fig. 7 (a) shows the absorption of BC6N-BlackP vdWH, BC6N, and BlackP. Particularly, there is the relative enhancement in absorption of vdWH at the energy around 1.50\u20131.80\u202feV compared to the independent components. The improvement is derived from the valence-to-conduction transitions from P-3pz to P-3pz at \u0393 and N-2pz to B-2pz at Y, see also Fig. 4(a). This is the manifestation of BC6N/BlackP vdWH as the potential light absorber to attain more infrared lights, potentially leading to the efficient solar-to-electricity conversion. The amplified absorption further propels us to compute the power conversion efficiency (PCE, \u03b7). This quantity describes the amount of solar energy being converted to electricity and it can be theoretically estimated according to Bernadi and Scharber formalism [51,52] \u03b7=FF\u00b7VOC\u00b7JSCPlight=0.65Egd-\u0394EC-0.3\u222bEgd\u221ePh\u00af\u03c9h\u00af\u03c9dh\u00af\u03c9\u222b0\u221ePh\u00af\u03c9dh\u00af\u03c9 where FF is the fill factor which determines ratio between the maximum power point and the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current [53]. FF typically varies from 0.50 to 0.82, depending on materials, while FF is set to 0.65 in this study [52]. This empirical number is experimentally estimated according to the practical limit of external quantum efficiency of solar cells absorbing photon energies equal or greater than the donors\u2019 band gaps without the recombination losses [52]. Meanwhile, VOC defines the estimation of highest open-circuit voltage which is expressed as VOC=Egd-\u0394EC-0.3 (in unit of eV). Egd represents the optical band gap of the donor (here BlackP) which is regarded as the material with the relatively higher conduction band. \u0394EC accounts for the conduction band offset between the donor and the acceptor and the empirical factor 0.3 denotes the energy conversion kinetics. The optical band gap in the present study is approximated by the electrical band gap (i.e., Kohn-Sham band gap) at HSE06 level of theory. Although both kinds of band gap differ by the presence of exciton energy that generally makes the former smaller [54], this simplification remains reasonable due to the linear variation of exciton energy with the band gap [55]. The trend of PCE can be correctly predicted despite the systematic shift of the absolute values. JSC is the short circuit current which is calculated by the integral of the energy-dependence of AM1.5 solar energy flux, Ph\u00af\u03c9 in unit of W/m\u22122/eV\u22121, weighted by photon energy h\u00af\u03c9. Meanwhile, Plight in the denominator is the total solar power of AM1.5 solar energy flux. The integrals of JSC and Plight were carried out by the basic Simpson approach. The comprehensive analysis of Eq. (1) tells us that either a too high or too small donor gap results in the low PCE. In addition, large \u0394E retards PCE because of the thereby significant energy loss. Fig. 7(b) depicts the dependence of the calculated PCE as a function of the conduction band offset (0.29\u202feV) and the band gap of the donor material (1.79\u202feV). BC6N/BlackP vdWH can deliver the maximum PCE of around 22.0%, denoted by the hexagonal dot. In comparison, the experimental optical band gap taking excitons into account is 1.30\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02\u202feV [54] is estimated to be ca. 20.0%, denoted by the triangular dot. Considering the errors in calculating the donor\u2019s band gap is around 0.49\u202feV and the error in the open-circuit voltage (\u0394VOC) is 0.10\u202feV [51]. The error of PCE (\u03b1) can be evaluated as [51] \u03b1=1\u03b7\u2202\u03b7\u2202VOC\u0394VOC2+\u2202\u03b7\u2202Egd\u0394Egd2 The error is calculated to be 3.0%, hence the upper bound of PCE ranging from 19.0 to 22.0%. This exceptional number is exceedingly comparable to the theoretical figures of several vdWHs such as 18.0% of BlackP-MoS2 [48] and 23% of BAs-BlackP (high-throughput screening) [30]. The conceptual demonstration of using this vdWH as a solar absorber is schematically shown in Fig. 7(c). It should be mentioned that the theoretical PCE is solely based on the band gap and the conduction band offset. The actual PCE involves multiple factors such as transport of charge carriers, diffusion length and excitonic recombination, etc., which are not taken into account in the present work. In addition, PCE is probably less sensitive to the stacking pattern of the constituents of vdWHs because the intrinsically. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "weak magnitude of interlayer interaction generally causes the minor changes in the atomic structures (and band gaps) of the component materials [56\u201358] Nonetheless, our proposed system can hopefully stimulate further in-depth investigation to entail the opportunity in alternative solar cell devices.  In summary, we present the electronic and optical properties of BCxN-BlackP (x\u202f=\u202f0, 2, 6) vdWHs investigated by means of first-principles DFT. The electronic properties of these vdWHs are effectively tunable by varying carbon concentration. BN-BlackP and BC2N-BlackP exhibit type-I band offset whereas BC6N-BlackP adopts type-II band offset. The variation in band alignment is ascribed to the reduction in band gaps of BCxN upon increasing carbon concentration and the prominent interlayer interactions between the constituent monolayers. The electronic properties of vdWHs can also be modulated by the external electric field due to the fundamental Stark effect. The band gaps of these hybrids drop with the applied electric field regardless of the field direction where band alignment also gets changed. This unique modulation in gap and alignment essentially enables gate-tenability of these vdWHs as a building block in electronic FET devices. Moreover, the potential photovoltaic application of BC6N-BlackP vdWH has been investigated because of its type-II band alignment. BC6N BlackP vdWH enhances solar absorption in the infrared region that leads to the efficient solar-to-electricity conversion. The estimated maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) is exceptional 19.0\u201322.0%.

Since fossil fuels are used to produce around 50% of electricity production [2], buildings are responsible for a considerable amount of greenhouse gas emissions. One solution to reduce the energy consumption from the electricity grid is to use building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) that provide electricity during the day when demand is at its peak. Roof-mounted BIPV accounts for 80% of the market and includes shingles, slates, tiles, or cladding. Organic semiconductors can be synthesized to selectively harvest a particular range of the solar spectrum, therefore allowing the fabrication of colored or transparent solar modules. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are made by combining a donor and an acceptor material. The donor material can either be a polymer deposited using solution processing or small molecules deposited using evaporation. Common acceptor materials are fullerenes or fullerenes derivates such as C60, C70, and C60-PCBM. Transparent solar modules can be added to the window area and increase the total available surface to produce electricity [3]. Previous work by our group has shown the potential for highly transparent photovoltaics (PV) for window applications due to their high average visible transmission [4]. Transparent photovoltaics (TPV) produce electricity by converting the near-infrared portion of the spectrum into electricity. Converting near-infrared, or heat into electricity, also changes the energy demand of the building. In the US, electricity consumption is higher during the summer due to cooling and ventilation, while natural gas is mostly used during the winter for heating [5]. During warmer months, the TPV reduces the amount of heat that reaches the inside of the building, therefore reducing the cooling energy demand. For colder months, the benefits of TPV could vary. TPV can help conserve the heat inside the building by reflecting the indoor radiant heat. However, since it also reduces the solar heat from the exterior, depending on the location and building design, it could either reduce or increase the heating demand. However, well-designed TPV is likely to reduce both the electricity and natural gas consumption since they have similar spectral properties as low emissivity coating technologies, which are deposited on the window to preserve heat loss [6]. The combined benefit of electricity production and change in energy demand for a building with TPV has not been evaluated. Transparent photovoltaic modules are not possible with traditional semiconductor materials, but semi-transparent modules are. The energy saving and electricity production were evaluated for amorphous silicon [7], and organic [8] semi-transparent modules. Their use was found to reduce the cooling energy demand in warm climate but increase the heating demand in cold climate. However, for all studies except the organic solar module, the window properties in the building energy simulation were based on the UV\u2013vis spectrometer measurement, which is incorrect since the energy absorbed for a PV module is transformed into electricity, not heat. Therefore, the spectrum needs to be corrected to account for this difference. The spectrum was corrected in one organic semi-transparent organic PV study [8]. However, the visible transmittance was only 23%, which is much lower than the 70% achieved for the technology considered in this work. Since the authors did not provide details about the solar cell material, device structure, and optical properties, it is impossible to compare the performance of semi-transparent photovoltaics with TPV. The conventional approach to evaluate the benefit of PV in a building is to use building simulation such as EnergyPlus [9]. Only one study has used outdoor testing facility to validate the energy saving potential of semi-transparent silicon modules [10]. Previous studies have focussed on energy balance over one year, assuming that all properties would remain the same. The degradation of the PV module, the electricity production from the grid, and the price of electricity and natural gas over time were not considered. Most importantly, all previous studies focussed on semi-transparent rather than transparent technologies. This work is the first to estimate the potential energy saving and electricity production associated with the use of highly transparent photovoltaics that can be employed for window applications. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) can be used to evaluate the benefit of PV and TPV over its full lifetime and is used extensively to compare the environmental impact of photovoltaic technologies using the IEA LCA guidelines for PV [11]. We compiled a comprehensive literature review of OPV LCA studies that have been published since 2009 to ensure the novelty of this work, and the results are available in the supplementary material (SM) in Table S1. Out of the 27 papers published since 2009, only one considers small molecules donor materials [12], which is the type of material required for transparent photovoltaics. In addition to the limited number of materials that have been considered, 25 focus on power generation, and the studies that include building applications are for fa\u00e7ade integration [13] and window retrofit [14]. The window retrofit study is the same application as this work, but it is a company presentation with limited details on the modelling and assumptions, and the results have not been published in the scientific literature. The only LCA study of PV for window application we could find looks at adaptive shading made of CIGS module, which also reduces the cooling and heating energy demand [15]. The system was significantly different since it was made of multiple solar photovoltaic modules attached to a support structure placed on top of a window. Therefore, this work is the first life cycle assessment of transparent for OPV. In LCA, the functional unit refers to the unit of comparison where products perform similarly. Using the power generation from ground-mounted or rooftop application in LCA simplifies the analysis but also makes it possible to compare OPV with other types of photovoltaics that use Watt peak (Wp) as a functional unit. For new applications where OPVs provide additional synergistic functions beyond just electricity production, there is a need to redefine an adequate functional unit and a method to assess the potential of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "OPV beyond the traditional cost, efficiency, and lifetime approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of the net energy and net cost saving method enables us to account for the solar heat management as well as the electricity production of TPV. The net environmental benefit approach is popular in environmental engineering since it considers the no-action scenario as the baseline process [16,17]. In this work, we used the term net energy benefits rather than net environmental benefits since we limited the analysis to energy. For buildings, the no-action scenario corresponds to the energy consumption for a building. The net energy considers the energy invested in manufacturing the solar cell, the electricity production, and the change in energy consumption compared to the baseline building. The same approach can be used to quantify the net cost-benefit or the cost-saving of the technology. A lifecycle approach was used to evaluate the net benefit of transparent photovoltaics in window and skylight applications for various locations in the United States for either new or retrofit applications.  The overall approach to calculate the net energy balance, including the various modelling tools used for building energy consumption and electricity production, is summarized in Fig. 1 (a). The system boundary for the cradle to gate LCA of organic TPV is shown in Fig. 1(b). A clear double pane window was used for the baseline scenario for both the window and the skylight structure. The double pane window was assumed to have a 13\u00a0mm air gap between two sheets of 3\u00a0mm clear glass. Two types of organic TPV modules for window were considered and are shown in Fig. 1(c). In the first instance, the TPV material is evaporated on the interior surface of a new window glass pane (Glass-TPV). The second scenario is for retrofit of existing windows. The TPV module is encapsulated and attached using adhesive on the interior surface of an existing window (Plastic-TPV). The lifetime of the window and skylight was fixed at 20\u00a0years [18], and the Plastic-TPV was assumed to be replaced every 10\u00a0years. Two levels of technological maturity were considered. The best-case scenario corresponds to device expected performance in the near future with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% and 25\u00a0years lifetime (T50) [4,19,20]. The current case scenario corresponds to demonstrated lab-scale technology [21] with a PCE of 3% and a 7\u00a0year lifetime. The two limiting scenarios were used to evaluate the actual benefit of increasing efficiency and lifetime for transparent photovoltaics in building applications. The TPV materials, manufacturing process, and structure are illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The photovoltaic cell is made by successive deposition of chloroalumnium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc), a small molecule donor material, and C60 in between molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and bathocuproine (BCP) blocking layers. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a transparent conductive oxide which is used on both sides of the device and silver grid is deposited for contact. We note that TPV with PCE\u00a0>\u00a010% has been certified at the laboratory scale, and pilot-scale modules are being produced with PCE around 3% [22]. The maximum window size was limited to 2.1\u00a0m by 3.7\u00a0m based on the largest existing tempering oven in the US, which is required for the heat treatment of glass to be resistant to impact, wind load, and thermal stress breakage [23]. The silver grid and the outer busbars required for individual glass panels covered 11% of the area [24]. For Plastic-TPV, the active photovoltaic area was smaller due to the encapsulation, which requires a 5\u00a0cm wide edge around the perimeter [25]. We selected Detroit, MI, Los Angeles, CA, Phoenix, AZ, and Honolulu, HI since they have a diverse range of solar insolation conditions, climate zones, energy cost and energy impact of electricity production that influence the benefit of both solar photovoltaic energy production and building energy balance. Fig. 2 illustrates the various grid regions in the US-based on the Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGrid) sub-regions [26], climate zones, average annual solar insolation, and commercial energy prices. The climate zones were divided into subregions moist (A), dry (B), and marine (C) depending on the mean temperature and precipitation [27]. Table 1 provides details about the electricity regions, climate zones, average insolation, and energy prices for electricity and natural gas for each location. The photovoltaic electricity production was calculated using RETScreen 4 on a daily basis [31], and the building energy demand was simulated using EnergyPlus 8.7 on an hourly basis [9]. RETScreen is a Clean Energy Management Software for renewable energy and project feasibility analysis from the Government of Canada. The solar insolation and climatic database was developed by NASA and RETScreen and provide global data based from 6700 ground-based stations and NASA\u2019s satellite data [32]. The net energy balance was calculated for the 20\u00a0years and included a reduction in electricity production over time due to solar module degradation. The degradation was assumed to be linear from to original efficiency value and degrade to half of its original value over a given time corresponding to the T50 value. For example, for the future technology, where to \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a010% and T50\u00a0=\u00a025 yrs, the efficiency after 25\u00a0years would be 5%. We selected commercial buildings since they have large window areas that maximize the TPV module size. Also, commercial buildings have high occupancy and high energy demand during the day when electricity production and change in building energy demand occur for TPV. The building energy demand simulation used the default values for the building internal loading [33] of the post-1980 construction DOE reference building [34]. The building geometry was modified using SkechUp Pro 2017 to increase the window to wall ratio or skylight to roof ratio (see Table 2 ). The thermal characteristics of the building envelop are available in Table S2. The medium office building model was used for the window application and the small office building for the skylight application. The reference for the mid-size office building was modified to increase the window to wall ratio from 33.0 to 67.8%. The small-size office for skylight application was. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "also modified to incorporate a skylight onto the south roof, as shown in Table 2. All buildings were assumed to have a south azimuth orientation. The electricity production from TPV installation on the south, east, and east (SEW) sides of the building was compared to having modules on all sides, including the north side (SEWN). For the skylight, the tilt angle was fixed by the roof angle to 21\u00b0, and the azimuth was south. The default value for heating source in the reference DOE building was modified for each location based on the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) [5] and is summarized in Table S3 for all cities. The climate data and the building operation schedule were imported from the EnergyPlus database [35]. For the building energy simulation, the optical properties of the TPV module are required to calculate the solar heat gain of the building through the window. The UV\u2013Vis absorption was measured from the front and back side using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV\u2013Vis spectrometer. The resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b)). Fig. 3 highlights the ultraviolet (<435\u00a0nm), visible, and near-infrared (>670\u00a0nm) regions of the solar spectrum compared to the organic TPV. Fig. 3(c) illustrates the solar spectrum reflectance, transmittance, and conversion, as well as the back reflectance from the radiant heat. The front and back side spectra (Fig. 3(a) and (b)) are not the same, and in particular, the absorbance is more important on the back side, which contributes to heat conservation. EnergyPlus does not account for electricity production from the TPV, and therefore the near-infrared radiations are considered absorbed by the building rather than converted to electricity, which causes an overestimation of the solar heat gain and cooling energy demand. The UV\u2013Vis spectrum can be adjusted to consider the portion of the spectrum that is converted to electricity, as reflected rather than absorbed by the building [8]. The spectrum of converted electricity corresponds to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. Fig. 3(a) shows the front illumination original spectra front transmittance (Tf), reflectance (Rf), and absorbance (Af) of the ClAlPc:C60 TPV. The corrected absorption Af* was calculated using Eq. (1) and the EQE of the TPV (Fig. 3(d)). Since the sum of the transmittance, absorbance, and reflectance is 1, and the transmittance remains constant, the corrected reflectance Rf* can be calculated using Eq. (2). The spectra correction was only applied for the front illumination spectra since the electricity production from indoor illumination was not considered in this work. The spectrum correction was performed on the current ClAlPc:C60 technology and therefore a more significant reduction in heat absorption can be expected for future technologies due to a higher external quantum efficiency in the same region of the spectrum. However, the EQE of future technology was not estimated. This is because the EQE, which corresponds to the amount of light that is absorbed and efficiently converted to electricity, is difficult to predict since it is a combination of materials, device structure and fabrication. Af\u2217(\u03bb)=Af(\u03bb)-EQE(\u03bb) Rf\u2217(\u03bb)=1-Tf(\u03bb)-Af\u2217(\u03bb) The overall scope of the LCA is illustrated in Fig. 2(a) and excluded the end-of-life stage due to the lack of knowledge about potential end-of-life management options. The functional unit was the operation of one building for 20\u00a0years. The life cycle inventory used previously published data for material production, module fabrication [12,36], and direct measurement during device fabrication in the lab. TPVs were fabricated using previously reported device structure [37]. For large-scale applications, devices require busbar and silver grid, which cover approximately 11% of the total area [24]. Material consumption was calculated based on the measured material thickness and material density from the literature using a 30% material deposition efficiency [12]. The direct energy consumption during device fabrication was recorded using a Fluke 345 clamp meter. Module manufacturing was assumed to take place in the US. The impact categorie was cumulative energy demand (CED) based on the Cumulative Energy Demand Method v1.09 in SimaPro8 [38]. The LCA included the change in electricity generation over time for each region. The carbon footprint for the electricity grid over time was calculated using the TRACI 2.1 method [39]. Additional information on the lifecycle inventory input for the OPV manufacturing and the energy production is available in Tables S12 to S13 of the SI. The net energy benefit (NEB) is the difference in energy balance between the building with and without TPV. It is calculated using Eq. (1). It includes the impact of electricity generation from the TPV (PVgen), the cradle to gate life-cycle manufacturing of TPV (PVCED), as well as the change in electricity or natural gas consumption from the building. Our NEB analysis was limited to cumulative energy demand (CED). This is because the greenhouse gas impact associated with TPV manufacturing cannot be adequately estimated when using of fullerene as the acceptor material and other fine chemicals with missing inventory information [36]. To convert the direct energy to primary energy, we used the conversion efficiency value for either natural gas (\u03b7NG) or electricity (\u03b7Grid). The average US grid efficiency was used for the life-cycle manufacturing of TPV while the regional data was employed for the energy building. The grid efficiency at each location changed over time (\u03b7Grid X) due to the changing energy source in the US electricity grid (Table S14 and Fig. S3). The NEB was calculated using the annual PV generation (EaPVgen), avoided electricity consumption (\u0394EaElec), and natural gas (\u0394EaNG) to account for degradation and changing grid efficiency over the 20\u00a0year lifetime of the study. NEBCED=-PVCED+\u2211EaPVgen\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394EaElec\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394EaNG\u03b7NG The most common metrics to compare energy technologies are the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), the energy return on investment (EROI), and the energy payback time (EPBT). The LCOE takes into account the systems energy conversion efficiency, lifetime, and cost, including construction, operation, and maintenance over its lifetime to calculate an electricity price in \u00a2/kWh that is often used to evaluate grid parity for new renewable technologies [40]. The LCOE approach does not capture many of the advantages of organic photovoltaics such. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "as flexibility, low weight, and selective spectrum absorption, which enables their adoption in new applications such as portable electronics, smart fabrics, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) [41\u201347]. Alternatives methods, such as the EROI or EPBT, use a life cycle assessment approach. The energy payback time (EPBT) corresponds to the amount of time the solar panel needs to produce electricity to payback for the energy required for its production. The EPBT calculation from the IEA guidelines for PV [48] assumes a constant grid efficiency and annual electricity production, which simplify the calculation to Eq. (4). However, this equation is inaccurate since it does not consider the change in building energy consumption, the decreasing electricity generation with degradation, and the electricity grid efficiency change over time. EPBTyears=PVCEDEaAveragePVgen\u03b7GridAverage For this project, the EPBT was calculated by considering the change in electricity (\u00b1\u0394EaElec)and natural gas (\u00b1\u0394EaNG), the TPV degradation impact on the annual electricity generation (EaPVgen)and the changing grid efficiency (\u03b7GridX). The payback time was calculated using Eq. (5), where t corresponds to the payback time. PVCED=\u22111tEaPVgen\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u22111t\u0394EaElec\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u22111t\u0394EaNG\u03b7NG The methodology for EROI was recently reviewed by the IEA task 12 to provide guidelines specific to photovoltaic applications [49]. EROI is a standard method that provides information on the ratio of energy returned to society in the form of a useful energy carrier over the total energy required or \u201cinvested\u201d in finding, extracting, processing, and delivering the energy [50,51]. Energy systems should have an EROI higher than one, implying that the energy delivered is higher than the amount of energy required to manufacture the system. Studies that use a life cycle approach to include all energy changes are referred as second-order EROI [52]. It is an accepted method by the IEA [49], and it was used to evaluate non transparent PV [7,53,54] for BIPV. However, it considered only electricity consumption change, not natural gas, which is commonly used in the United States for heating. Both EROI and EPBT methods are recommended by the IEA LCA methodology and are geographically dependent [11]. In theory the EPBT can be calculated directly using the EROI value by dividing the lifetime of the system by the EROI. However, using this calculation method overestimates the EPBT because the solar module electricity production decreases over time. EROI=\u2211EaPVgen\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394EaElec\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394ENG\u03b7NGPVCED Because of the lack of information on the greenhouse gas generation during TPV manufacturing, the analysis considered the reduction in GHG due to photovoltaics generation (PVgen) and the change in building energy demand (\u00b1\u0394EaElectricity/NG). Similar to the NEB analysis, the analysis was performed on an annual basis to account for the degradation of TPV and changing carbon footprint of the grid. The annual increase in energy prices in the US for the next 20\u00a0years was calculated based on the EIA 2018 forecast [55] in 2017$ to account for inflation. It was calculated to be 0.22% per year for electricity and 1.01% per year for natural gas. The maximum module price was calculated based on the lifetime saving for each location and the net present value.  Fig. 4 combines the building energy demand and the electricity production from the TPV module with 10% power conversion efficiency for the four cities considered. For the window application, the two electricity generation curves correspond to whether all the windows are covered with TPV (SEWN) or only the south, east, and west-facing directions (SEW). The electricity production depends on the azimuth and tilt of the module. The tilt is fixed at 90\u00b0 for TPV in windows, which is not the optimal angle for the PV module at any location. The south direction of the building has the largest solar insolation. However, the northern side can also produce electricity since the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) used in the electricity production from photovoltaics considers not only the direct solar radiations but also the reflected and diffuse insolation [56]. The PV production from the window application results in an almost constant electricity production throughout the year, in all cases except Detroit. Solar modules are generally installed at a tilt angle that corresponds to their latitude to maximize electricity production. The tilt angle from the skylight was 21\u00b0, which is similar to the Honolulu latitude. We assumed that the PV electricity production only reduced the consumption of electricity and not natural gas. Therefore, there is a relatively good match between electricity production from TPV and electricity demand for all cities. The cumulative energy demand associated with the TPV manufacturing of a 1\u00a0m2 module on glass or plastics is shown in Fig. 5 . The area corresponds to the size of the module, not the active area of the solar module. This is because the window area is the same per building, but the active solar cell area change depending on the type of modules. Because of the additional substrate and encapsulation, the Plastic-TPV has a 6% higher CED than Glass-TPV. In single-junction small molecules solar cells, the ITO sputtering accounts for about 50% of the total CED, and the active layer deposition varies from 10 to 20% depending on the material combination [12]. For TPV, the direct energy during the active layer deposition was measured to be 39.8\u00a0MJ/m2, which is 73% higher than previously reported values [12] and can be explained by a different deposition system with pumps having higher energy consumption. Even with higher deposition energy than in previous studies, the CED varied from 3.1 to 10.3\u00a0MJ/Wp for Glass-TPV and 3.4\u201311.4\u00a0MJ/Wp for Plastic-TPV while considering current and future technology. Previous values for single-junction OPV ranged from 3.6 to 8.4\u00a0MJ/Wp [12,57], which is similar to the values calculated in this work. By comparison for inorganic modules, CdTe embodied energy varies from 5.9 to 7.8\u00a0MJ/Wp and monocrystalline Silicon from 18.5 to 29.4\u00a0MJ/Wp [58]. Additional comparisons are available in SM (Fig. S1). The annual change in building energy demand with TPV is summarized in Tables S4-S11 in the SM. The net energy benefit of TPV for glass and plastic solar cells is shown in Fig. 6 and is positive for all scenarios considered. The photovoltaics electricity. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "generation was based on the current (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a03%, T50\u00a0=\u00a07 yrs) and future (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a010% T50\u00a0=\u00a025 yrs) technologies. The manufacturing energy was found to be negligible compared to the energy saving over 20\u00a0years for all scenarios. In addition to electricity production, the TPV reduces the summer electricity consumption due to the reduction in the NIR radiations entering the building. At the same time, the TPV layer reduces the heat loss from the building, which is helpful during the colder periods and contributes to reducing the natural gas consumption in most scenarios except for the skylight application in Detroit. The electricity production difference between Plastic-TPV and Glass-TPV is 73% in the current scenario but around 8% for the future scenario. This difference highlights the benefit of replaceable solar modules over integrated modules until high modules lifetimes are achieved. In the current scenario, energy saving had the most benefit, but as efficiency and lifetime of PV device increase, PV electricity production will become more important than energy saving. In Fig. 6 for current technology Glass-TPV, the PV electricity corresponds to 15\u201320% of the energy saving but it increases to 94\u2013126% for future technology. Using plastic modules (Plastic-TPV) and replacement every 10\u00a0years, the PV electricity contribution double to 32\u201341% of the energy saving for current technology and it increases to 110\u2013143% for future technology. The trend is similar for skylight. Covering the south direction of the building with TPV increased the PV production by 15\u201320% for Glass-TPV and 18\u201325% for Plastic-TPV, with the lowest increase in Phoenix and the largest in Honolulu. The combination of various energy sources in buildings highlights the importance of the cumulative energy approach since 1 GJ of natural gas burned in a furnace is not equivalent to 1 GJ consumed in an electrical furnace. In 2016, the production of 1 GJ of solar electricity prevented the production of 2.2\u20133.5 GJ of primary energy from the grid, depending on the location. By comparison, reducing the natural gas consumption by 1 GJ only reduces the CED by 1.3 GJ. The change in electricity production from the grid was included in this work. The grid efficiency factors are available in Table S15. Since the CED from manufacturing is negligible compared to the energy produced during the 20\u00a0years lifetime considered for this study, the energy return on investment (EROI) and the energy payback time (EPBT) (Fig. 7 ) were calculated for each scenario. An EROI greater than one implies that more energy is produced or saved due to the technology than used during its manufacturing. In Fig. 7, the range of values corresponds to the current and future cases. All scenarios considered have an EROI greater than 1. The combined energy savings and electricity production can result in a higher EROI for TPV than a traditional opaque organic PV. In Fig. 7, to compare with other types of solar modules, we used the results from a comprehensive review that included various types of modules manufactured after 2009 and calculated their EROI and EPBT, assuming a 25\u00a0years lifetime and 1000\u00a0W/m2 insolation [58]. We want to note that the best average normal insolation for the US is 970\u00a0W/m2, for a two-axis system. Therefore, the reference results for EROI are higher and EPBT lower than what is achievable in the US. The EROI allows the comparison of the same module in different applications, in our case, between the window and skylight application. The NEB in Fig. 6 was higher for the window than for the skylight application, but this was due to the specific building and module size considered. The EROI is higher for the skylight than for the window application since the orientation of the skylight at 21 degrees is more optimal than the vertical windows. The EROI for plastic TPV was lower than glass due to the module replacement after 10\u00a0years but would be similar to glass if plastic modules could last 20\u00a0years. The EROI metric compared to the NEB results provides a better insight into the diminishing return of covering the north side of the building. For example, in Phoenix, the EROI decreases from 102 to 83 for the glass application and best-case scenario. For the window application, Phoenix had the highest EROI (102 for SEW), while for the skylight application, Honolulu (208) was slightly higher than Phoenix (205). Previous studies for BIPV reported EROI for semi-transparent silicon modules that varied from 11.7 to 34.5 in Singapore, which was lower than what is calculated for all TPV in most locations in the US. The lower EROI can be attributed to the lower module efficiency of semi-transparent silicon PV, the additional light required to maintain the building operation [7], as well as the high manufacturing energy for silicon modules compared to organic photovoltaics [12]. In other BIPV applications in New York City where the silicon module was used as cladding rather than in window, the EROI was 7.2 [53], The higher EROI from this work demonstrates the benefit of OPV for building applications. The EPBT is a useful metric to quantify the time needed for the system to payback the energy that is required for manufacturing it. The EPBT needs to be lower than the lifetime of the energy system, which in this work was assumed to be 20\u00a0years. For all types of transparent photovoltaic modules and locations, the EPBT is less than 1.2\u00a0years. From the reference study, organic PV had the lowest EPBT reported to date at 113\u00a0days [58], but this works shows that the EPBT for transparent organic PV can be even shorter at 51\u00a0days for building-integrated application. In Fig. 7. (b), the EPBT is shown to vary from 51\u00a0days to 405\u00a0days (0.14\u20131.11\u00a0years) for all scenarios considered in this work. In addition to energy saving, the benefit of TPV in four locations in the US was evaluated based on the avoided cost and greenhouse gases for all scenarios. The detailed results are available in Tables S16-S17. The cumulative avoided cost and greenhouse gas emissions, which included the change in electricity and natural gas prices. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "for each location over time, and the changing electricity grid are shown in Fig. 7 for the best-case scenario of the window application. The highest value corresponds to SEWN. The NEB for glass SEWN in Honolulu was 22% higher than Detroit, but the energy saving was calculated to be 246% higher due to the highest cost of both electricity and natural gas. Due to its high electricity cost of more than 15\u00a2/kWh, Los Angeles had the second-largest energy saving even though it had the lowest net energy benefit. The second benefit of TPV is the reduction in greenhouse gases, which is illustrated in Fig. 8 (b). Currently, Honolulu has the highest carbon footprint at 897 kgCO2/MWh, but it has ambitious renewable energy goals and plans to replace its coal and oil electricity production with solar and wind. The forecasted carbon footprint in 2035 was calculated to be 189 kgCO2/MWh, which suggest that the greenhouse gases reduction due to TPV over time will decrease in Honolulu. The change in slope for the avoided emissions in Honolulu and Los Angeles is due to the important decrease in carbon footprint over time. By comparison, the carbon footprint in Phoenix will only slightly decrease due to the replacement of coal by natural gas, and in Detroit, nuclear is replaced with natural gas, which could increase the carbon footprint. In Los Angeles, there is also plans to more than double renewable energy sources. The current electricity production has already a low carbon footprint of 443 kgCO2/MWh, which is less than half the current impact of electricity production in Honolulu, the use of TPV results in the lowest GHG benefit. The cumulative energy saving for each location was used to calculate the maximum price of TPV per unit of area (USD/m2), which corresponds to a breakeven price for all the scenarios considered in each city. The range of values for each location corresponds to the current and future case scenario. Given that the current price of the module is unknown, the maximum price of the module is calculated. Rather than estimating the energy saving to the consumer, Fig. 9 . provides manufacturing cost goals for manufacturers. The highest prices per area were for Honolulu and the lowest for Detroit for all scenarios. The maximum price was lower for plastic modules due to their replacement every 10\u00a0years. It was calculated to be between 41 and 187$/m2 for low-efficiency solar cells and 88\u2013350 $/m2 for the best TPV modules. For the skylight application, the price was higher and varied from 137 to 759 $/m2. In the window application, the price range for each location was broader since the current case scenario assumed rapid degradation, and therefore the difference in electricity production was significant. The range for window applications was 80\u2013730 $/m2 while it was between 286 and 1565 $/m2 for the skylight application. The potential of manufacturing plastic modules moderate efficiency for retrofit at a very low price might result in the early commercialization of the plastic product rather than integration into the glass window, which will be more expensive.  We demonstrate, for the first time, the net energy benefit of transparent photovoltaics in building applications across the United States using a life cycle approach that considered electricity production and change in building performance. We accounted for a range of module performance possible today and in the near future (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a03% T50\u00a0=\u00a07 yrs to: \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a010% T50\u00a0=\u00a025 yrs) and evaluated the technology impact in terms of energy and cost benefit. All scenarios had positive NEB and led to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs due to the energy saving in addition to electricity production. The NEB was used to calculate the EROI and EPBT, which were found to be either better or comparable to other photovoltaics technologies even when considering lower efficiency and replacement after 10\u00a0years. To evaluate the impact of transparent photovoltaics over time in each location, the effect of changing electricity grid and energy price was included in the greenhouse gas emissions and energy cost. This work was limited to one type of organic photovoltaics module. Nonetheless, it provides key insights regarding the possibility of designing transparent photovoltaics that maximizes the electricity generation and energy saving based on the location.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

However, their properties change depending on the thin film fabrication method; several preparation methods for said films have been reported , obtaining, as a result, different studies pertinent to their optical, morphological, and structural properties, among others. Titanium dioxide thin films have been synthesized using the innovative chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. This physical-chemical preparation method presents great advantages in contrast with merely physical deposition methods, like chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and sputtering deposition ; mainly because high economic resources and a strict control of the experimental synthesis parameters are not required. As a result, in recent years it has been reported that films deposited via CBD method present properties comparable to those prepared via physical methods . This work presents a study of the structural, morphological and optical properties of the TiO2 thin films prepared by the CBD method in an aqueous solution of TiCl3. Subsequently, the samples were submitted to annealing process varying the temperature between 373 and 723 K in order to examine the changes in the physical properties.  TiO2 thin films were fabricated by CBD method using soda lime glass as substrates (76 mm \u00d7 26 mm). Samples were fabricated in a solution of distilled water mixed with TiCl3, obtaining an acidic solution with pH equal to 1.3, without usage of any type of chemical precursor for its regulation. The substrate was vertically submerged into the solution using a mechanical support and the bath was heated initially to 353 K, the agitation was reduced to 100 rpm for 8 h, keeping the pH constant. The experiment performed consisted in mixing 4 mL of TiCl3 and 76 mL of distilled water in a glass beaker. The beaker was placed over a heating plate with constant agitation using a magnetic stirrer to avoid decantation of the TiO2. This solution was agitated for 55 min at a rate of 800 rpm at room temperature. Then, the substrate was vertically submerged into the solution using a mechanical support and the bath was heated initially to 353 K; afterward, the agitation was reduced to 100 rpm for 8 h, keeping the pH of the solution at 1.3. The substrates were removed from the solution and dried in ambient conditions. After the deposition process, the samples were heated to 373, 573, and 723 K to study changes in their structural, morphological, and optical properties. The films were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a diffractometer X'Pert pro PANalytical equipped with a Cu-K\u03b1 source: 1.54 \u00c5, a potential difference of 40 KV and a current of 40 mA; the software used to analyze the results was the X'Pert Highscore Plus, using the Rietveld refinement method. Morphological properties were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a microscope VEGA 3SB with a tungsten filament, under high vacuum conditions (10\u22126 mbar) and an Xflash 410 m detector. Spectral transmittance measurements were taken with a spectrophotometer Cary 5000 UV-VIS-NIR, varying the wavelengths between 300 and 2500 nm.  Fig. 1 presents the XRD patterns of the TiO2 thin films; these films were fabricated with solution pH = 1.3 and temperature of 353 K. The films were then annealed at 373, 573, and 723 K. When the temperature was Ti = 353 K, a Rutile phase was observed (PDF 01-076-0319), which does not disappear with the variation of annealing temperatures. When the temperature was 723 K, the Anatase phase was observed (PDF 01-073-1764), this phase corresponds to a monotropic form of TiO2 and it was present in 19% of the sample, with the remaining 81% being the Rutile phase. The Anatase phase present in the sample with T = 723 K can be associated to the segregation of crystalline phases of different TiO2 polymorphs, which by increasing crystallinity due to the annealing processes (associated to the decrease of the amorphous halo in the XRD patterns), allowed the identification of this phase in the preferential plane (101) (Fig. 1). The crystalline parameters of the Rutile phase in the sample with T = 353 K are presented in Table 1 . Fig. 2 presents the SEM micrograph of the sample with T = 353 K; the presence of nanoflowers is observed. These types of nanostructures were formed by the CBD method when the pH of the solution is around 1.3. With increased pH, these nanostructures tend to disappear forming platelets . The inset in Fig. 2 presents a magnification of one of the regions, which shows in detail that the nanoflower structures are formed by nanorods of approximately 130.2 \u00b1 12.5 nm. Fig. 3 presents the change in topography of the samples when these were submitted to annealing temperature between 373 and 723 K. It was observed that the temperature variation strongly affects sample topography. When the temperature was 373 K, the nanoflowers seemed to disappear, giving way to the formation of new structures, such as agglomerates or platelets (Fig. 3). Additionally, from the micrographs, it was determined that film thickness was 878.56 \u00b1 0.36 nm. Using film thickness, Beer's law , and spectral absorbance measurements (Fig. 4 a), the following equation was used to determine the absorption coefficient (\u03b1) of the thin films, which later allowed the determination of the gap energy (Fig. 4b): \u03b1=2.303dA where d corresponds to the thickness and A to the absorbance. Fig. 4a presents the absorbance spectra of all the samples. A strong absorption in the UV region was observed for all the samples, this phenomenon was presented between 306 \u00b1 0.5 and 308 \u00b1 0.5 nm; however, no significant changes in absorbance were noted with increased annealing temperature. From Eq. (1) and the Tauc model , the absorption curves were obtained, showing that the energy gap (Eg) of the sample with the initial temperature of 353 K is 3.0 \u00b1 0.02 eV and for the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "sample with annealing temperature of 723 K was 2.98 \u00b1 0.02 eV. The sample with initial temperature of 353 K shows an Eg value associated to the Rutile phase , which corresponds to the findings in the XRD patterns; meanwhile, the Eg for the sample with the highest temperature decreased. This can be associated mainly to two factors: the presence of the two phases in this sample, Rutile and Anatase (Fig. 1), and the change in sample topography caused by fragmentation and agglomerate formation.  Titanium dioxide thin films were fabricated by the CBD method and then submitted to annealing processes at temperatures ranging between 373 and 723 K. All thin films exhibit the Rutile phase, except the sample annealed at 723 K where the Anatase phase was also found; this was associated to the segregation of TiO2 polymorphs in the samples. Topographical changes caused by temperature variations were evident in the disappearance of the nanoflower structures formed at T = 353 K, causing the formation of agglomerates. It was determined that the maximum absorbance of the films was in the UV region, between 306 and 308 nm. The films presented a gap energy ranging between 2.98 and 3.00 eV; this variation was associated to changes in topography and crystalline structure.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Therefore, they have been recognized as an efficient strategy to increase light harvesting without worsening the separation of photogenerated charges and have promising applications in such active fields related to the solar energy utilization as photocatalysis and solar cells. Tantalum-based materials, as a class of the most promising functional semiconductors, possess a more negative conduction band (CB) than most of the well-known photocatalytic materials, such as TiO2, ZnS, and so on. Thus, they have attracted much attention to the overall water splitting for hydrogen production . However, due to their rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, they usually suffer from low photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiencies. Since the potential gradients between nanostructures can offer the transfer driving force and thus dominate the transportation direction and distance of photogenerated charge carriers, constructing tantalum-based heterostructures, such as CdS/Ta2O5 , In2O3/Ta2O5 , Bi2O3/Bi-NaTaO3 , NiO/NaTaO3 , not only can significantly enhance the photogenerated charge separation, but also to some extent extend the light absorption range. However, due to the rapid hydrolysis rates of most tantalum-based precursors in aqueous solution and the high crystalline temperature, all the heterostructures reported so far usually exhibit the irregular morphologies, e.g., bulk or nanoparticle aggregates. Particularly, there often appear some unexpected defects at the interfaces. In this case, the enhancement of photocatalytic activity is greatly restricted for these heterostructures. Therefore, developing an efficient approach to fabricate tantalum-based heterostructures with well-defined interfaces is critical to further enhance the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production of the tantalum-based heterostructures. Recently, our group has successfully fabricated the hierarchical structure of Ta2O5 single crystalline rods via hydrolyzing H2TaF7 when it slowly forms by etching Ta powders with HF and H2O2 under hydrothermal conditions . In this approach, the nucleation and growth rates of Ta2O5 are finely controlled by the etching kinetics of Ta powders, which drives the formation of well-defined structure of Ta2O5 with a higher crystallinity. As a result, the hierarchical structure of Ta2O5 single crystalline rods exhibits a greater photocatalytic activity. In view of this, we have developed a synchronous etching-growth approach for the fabrication of facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 porous nanofibers with a good photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. In our fabrication strategy, the reaction kinetics are elaborately manipulated to make the etching rate of Ta2O5 match with the heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth rate of NaTaO3 by simply adjusting such parameters as the NaOH concentration ([NaOH]), solvent species. As a result, fragmentary NaTaO3 nanocubes in-situ grow along [1 2 1] on the Ta2O5 (1 1 0) crystal planes to form facet-coupling heterojunctions. Importantly, owing to the effectively reduced interface defects and the minimum charge transfer resistance in the facet-coupling heterojunctions, the as-obtained facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 porous nanofibers show an obviously enhanced interfacial charge separation and a significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity compared with the NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composites, homogeneous Ta2O5 nanofibers and NaTaO3 nanofibers. This is the first example of tantalum-based heterostructures with well-defined interfaces. The synchronous etching-growth strategy reported here will open a new era to manufacture well-defined heterojunctions.  The Ta2O5 nanofibers were prepared by the electrospinning method. 0.78 g tantalum ethoxide was added to a mixture of 4 g absolute ethanol and 1.5 g acetic acid in a capped bottle. Then 0.35 g PVP K90 was added to the solution and stirred at room temperature for 5 h to get a homogeneous viscous solution. Then the obtained solution was drawn into a plastic syringe equipped with a capillary. The feeding rate of the solution in the syringe was controlled as 400 \u03bcL/h by using a syringe pump. The voltage connected to the needle of the syringe was 10 kV and the distance between the tip of the needle and the aluminum foil collector was 20 cm. Finally, the electrospun nanofibers were calcined in air at 740 \u00b0C for 1 h, and the heating rate was 10 \u00b0C/min. The facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 porous nanofibers were synthesized by the solvothermal method using Ta2O5 porous nanofibers as the precursors. In a typical synthesis, 40 mg Ta2O5 porous nanofibers were added in 75 mM, 45 mL NaOH solutions with ethanol/water ratio of 40:5 at room temperature under ultrasonic conditions. Then the obtained solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, and the autoclave was sealed and heated to 200 \u00b0C for 12 h. After the autoclave cooled to the room temperature, the precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times, respectively, and then dried in an oven at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h for further characterization. In order to study the formation process of the as-prepared samples, we also prepared contrastive samples obtained at different NaOH concentrations (0, 0.07, 0.1 and 0.5 M), different ethanol/water ratios (0:45, 15:30, 22.5:22.5 and 45:0) as well as different solvothermal times (1, 5 and 9 h), respectively. The contents of NaTaO3 in the as-prepared composites were estimated according to the EDX analysis. For comparison, the contrastive NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers were prepared by a one-step direct electrospinning method. The obvious difference is that the precursor solution was composed of 0.78 g tantalum ethoxide, 4 g absolute ethanol and 1.5 g acetic acid, 0.08 g sodium acetate and 0.5 g DMF. Then 0.5 g PVP K90 was added to obtain a transparent solution. The following procedure was consistent with the preparation of Ta2O5 nanofibers. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a D/Max-RBX X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu K\u03b1 irradiation in the range of 10\u00b0 \u2264 2\u03b8 \u2264 80\u00b0 at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 Field-emission SEM (Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were carried out on a H-600 STEM/EDX (PV9100, HITACHI). Samples for TEM and HRTEM were ultrasonically dispersed in absolute ethanol, and the obtained suspension was dropped on a copper. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "grid coated with carbon film and then drying in air. UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were obtained on a UV-2550 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard, and the spectra were recorded in the range 200\u2013800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature on an F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. The photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production of the samples were evaluated without any cocatalysts under the simulant solar light irradiation in pure water and 20 vol% methanol aqueous solutions, respectively. The reactions were carried out in a sealed gas circulation system with an external irradiation cell. The reactor was placed about 20 cm under a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech Co., Ltd., China). This lamp shows a spectrum covering from 320 nm to 780 nm with the UV output power of 2.6 W and the visible output power of 19.6 W, and can act as a simulant solar light source. The detailed process was as follows: 20 mg of the as-prepared catalysts were ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min in 100 mL pure water or 20 vol% methanol aqueous solutions. After the closed gas circulation system and reaction cells were well evacuated, the suspension was irradiated by the simulant solar light, and the solution was kept under stirring with a magnetic stirrer during reaction in order to prohibit particles to settle at the bottom of the reactor. Meanwhile, after 1 h internal of irradiation, the evolved gases were in situ analyzed by a gas chromatograph (TECHCOMP, GC 7890-II, MS-5A column, nitrogen carrier), which was connected directly to the closed gas circulating line. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI760D) in a conventional three-electrode cell in the electrolyte of 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous soluton. Platinum foil and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. For preparing working electrode, 80 mg sample was mixed with 1 mL H2O and 100 \u03bcL poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) adhesive by ultrasonication for 20 min. The PVA adhesive was prepared by mixing 2.5 g PVA and 50 mL H2O at 50 \u00b0C for 10 h and subsequently at 90 \u00b0C for 5 h. Then 100 \u03bcL of the mixture was spread onto the carbon cloth and dried under an infrared heat lamp. This process was repeated for twice to obtain the working electrode. The working electrode exposed to the electrolyte was a circular film with a surface area of 0.2 cm2.  We have synthesized the facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 porous nanofibers by a solvothermal method using Ta2O5 porous nanofibers as the precursor. The typical sample was obtained in a 75 mM NaOH solution with ethanol/water ratio of 40:5. The SEM image in Fig. 1 a reveals that the as-obtained product is entirely composed of nanofibers with a uniform diameter of 100 \u00b1 5 nm and a well-defined shape. The inset of Fig. 1a shows that the nanoparticles covered on the surface of nanofibers have shaped edges with right-angles. This is quite different from the morphology of the electrospun Ta2O5 nanofibers, implying the formation of a new component in the as-prepared product. The XRD diffraction peaks in Fig. 1b can be readily indexed to orthorhombic NaTaO3 (space group Pcmn (No. 62)) with lattice constants a = 5.5213 \u00c5, b = 7.7952 \u00c5 and c = 5.4842 \u00c5 (JCPDS 73-0878) and orthorhombic Ta2O5 (space group C2mm (No. 38)) with lattice constants a = 6.2 \u00c5, b = 3.66 \u00c5 and c = 3.89 \u00c5 (JCPDS 89-2843), revealing that the as-prepared product consists of NaTaO3 and Ta2O5. The HRTEM image (Fig. 1c) further indicates that the fragmentary NaTaO3 nanocubes grows along [1 2 1] on the Ta2O5 (1 1 0) crystal planes, forming a tight and compact heterostructure. This is because in this case, the lattice mismatch between the crystal plane of NaTaO3 (1 2 1) and that of Ta2O5 (1 1 0) \u03b4=2|a(121)\u2212a(110)|/a(121)+a(110) (where a (121) and a (110) correspond to their interplanar spacings) is calculated to be only about 13%, much lower than those of the other cases. The irregular distribution of NaTaO3 nanocubes on the surface of nanofibers can be ascribed to the randomly exposed (1 1 0) crystal planes of Ta2O5 nanoparticles in the electrospun Ta2O5 nanofibers. The facet-coupling character of the as-prepared sample has been further confirmed by more similar HRTEM images taken from other heterostructures between NaTaO3 and Ta2O5 (Fig. S1). Fig. 1d shows the EDX analysis of the as-obtained typical facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers. It indicates that the sample contains Na, Ta, and O elements. The atomic ratio of Na and Ta elements in the sample is 1:1.9. Thus, the NaTaO3 content in the as-obtained heterostuctures can be calculated to be 69 mol.%. The above characterization clearly suggests that using the synchronous etching-growth technology has obtained the facet-coupling heterojunctions between the NaTaO3 (1 2 1) crystal planes and the Ta2O5 (1 1 0) crystal planes, which can effectively reduce the interface defects and minimize the charge transfer resistance, and thus are expected to enhance the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. To decipher the formation process of the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers, the solvothermal conditions influencing on the structures and morphologies of the products have been in detail investigated including the NaOH concentration ([NaOH]), solvent species and solvothermal time (t), etc., and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1 . Figs. S2 and S3 show the SEM images and XRD patterns of the products prepared at different [NaOH]. It can be seen that only in the presence of NaOH can the NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers be obtained, and the contents and average crystallite sizes of NaTaO3 nanocubes increase with increasing [NaOH]. When [NaOH] is up to 0.5 M, NaTaO3 nanofibers which are entirely composed of nanocubes are prepared. These results indicate that the generation of NaTaO3 during the solvothermal process is closely related to the concentration of free OH\u2212 anions. The results of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "experiment 6 in Table 1 states that when the mixed solvent is replaced with water containing 0.5 M NaOH, the Ta2O5 nanofibers are completely etched, forming separated NaTaO3 nanocubes, as shown in Fig. 2 . This means that the etching of Ta2O5 nanofibers in pure water is completed before the generation of NaTaO3 nanocubes, indicating a rapid reaction rate of Ta2O5 nanofibers with NaOH in water. The effect of the ratio of ethanol/water on the formation of the as-prepared NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers is further studied shown in Fig. S4 and experiments 7\u201310 in Table 1. At [NaOH] of 75 mM, the reaction of free OH\u2212 ions with Ta2O5 nanofibers does not occur to generate alkaline hydroxylated Ta-O ionic groups in water, whereas it happens under the solvothermal condition. This is because the free OH\u2212 ions in in ethanol aqueous solution exhibit a higher activity than those in water due to the weak solvation of ethanol . The extraordinary decrease of the NaTaO3 content in ethanol suggests that the existence of a small amount of water can accelerate the etching of Ta2O5 nanofibers. The decreased etching rate in the presence of ethanol can also be evidenced by experiment 11 in Table 1, where the content of NaTaO3 in the product increased slightly to 29% even when t is prolonged to 20 h. Therefore, it is vital for the formation of facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers to have an etching rate of Ta2O5 nanofibers matching with the heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth rate of NaTaO3, which is determined by the free OH\u2212 ions activity and an appropriate reaction rate. Fig. 3 shows the effect of t on the product structures. Combining with the data in experiments 12\u201314 of Table 1, we can easily found that in the first 1 h, the solvothermal reaction shows a high reaction rate and many obvious nanocubes are generated on the surface of nanofibers, indicating the etching of Ta2O5 begins with the surface of nanofibers. With prolonging t, the content and crystallite sizes of the NaTaO3 increase accordingly with a small degree. The increase is mainly due to the fact that when the surficial Ta2O5 nanoparticles have been etched, the rate of the solvothermal reaction depends on the mass transport or diffusion of the free OH\u2212 ions into the inner of nanofibers. Therefore, it is vital for the in-situ epitaxial growth of facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers that deliberately controlling the concentration of higher active and free OH\u2212 anions and the solvent composition makes the dissolution rate of Ta2O5 match with the nucleation and crystal growth rates of NaTaO3. Based on the effects of the solvothermal conditions on the structures and morphologies of the products described in the above, we can reasonably propose the formation mechanism of the as-obtained facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O3 nanofibers in Scheme 1 . In the solvothermal process, the electrospun Ta2O5 nanofibers are partly etched from the surface and hydroxylated by the free OH\u2212 ions to form a variety of hydroxylated Ta\u2013O ionic groups under strongly alkaline conditions . When the Na+ ions and hydroxylated Ta\u2013O ionic groups in the solution around the Ta2O5 grains reach the super saturated concentration, the NaTaO3 begins to nucleate on the surface of the etched Ta2O5 nanoparticles. With the etching reaction continuing to form more hydroxylated Ta\u2013O ionic groups, the in-situ epitaxial growth of stable NaTaO3 nanograins occurs along (1 1 0) plane of the etched Ta2O5 nanoparticles due to the lowest lattice mismatch with the (1 2 1) plane of NaTaO3. As the (1 2 1) plane of NaTaO3 has the fastest growth rate, it will disappear quickly with the reaction continuing, making the mutually perpendicular (0 2 0) and (1 0 1) planes of NaTaO3 with the same interplanar spacing (0.389 nm) exposed to form nanocubes . In such a way, we have for the first time obtained a facet-coupling heterostructure based on Ta2O5. This heterojunction is completely different from the previously reported heterostructured Ta2O5-based photocatalysts, in which the crystal planes of the different components contact randomly, even are separated by an amorphous transition . Furthermore, in order to evaluate the advantage of the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructrued NaTaO3/Ta2O5 porous nanofibers in the light absorption, charge transfer and photocatalytic hydrogen production, we have also synthesized the NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers with the same NaTaO3 content as that of the as-obtained facet-coupling heterostructrued NaTaO3/Ta2O5 by a one-step approach for comparison. Fig. 4 shows the SEM image and XRD pattern of the NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers. It is clear that the contrastive NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite exhibits a nanofiber morphology with a rough and porous surface, which is different from the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructure. Fig. 5 shows the UV\u2013vis spectrum of the as-obtained facet-coupling heterostructrued NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers. For comparison, the UV\u2013vis spectra of the homogeneous counterparts, such as the Ta2O5 nanofibers and NaTaO3 nanofibers, as well as the contrast samples of the NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers characterized in Fig. 4 are also depicted here. Simultaneously, the corresponding bandgap energies of the four samples have been estimated by the Kubelka\u2013Munk method (the inset of Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, the light absorption band edges of the pristine Ta2O5 nanofibers and NaTaO3 nanofibers appear at 326 and 347 nm, respectively, corresponding to the bandgap energies of 3.80 and 3.57 eV. These are attributed to their intrinsic absorptions. For the as-prepared facet-coupling and composite heterostructures, they both exhibit two distinctive band edges. These are both ascribed to the electron band-to-band transition energies of Ta2O5 and NaTaO3, respectively, further indicating their compositions. But the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructures exhibit a much stronger light absorption than the NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers even when they have similar chemical compositions. On the other hand, the nanofibers composed of pristine NaTaO3 nanocubes have also a light absorption band edge at 347 nm, corresponding to the bandgap energies (E g) of 3.57 eV. These two values are somewhat different from the corresponding ones of the NaTaO3 microparticles reported by the Kudo\u2019s group, which have an absorption band edge at 310 nm and E g of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "4.0 eV . The as-prepared NaTaO3 nanofibers show an obvious red-shift in the absorption band edge with a narrower band gap if compared with the latter. This is because the latter samples are prepared by an entirely different solid-state method. They have different structures and morphologies from the NaTaO3 nanofiber samples fabricated here, and thus exhibit somewhat different light absorption regions. This similar phenomenon has also been reported in some other materials, such as Ta2O5 and CdS, etc. . For example, commercial Ta2O5 has a band gap of 4.0 eV, while the amorphous mesoporous Ta2O5 prepared by a sol\u2013gel method shows a light absorption band edge of 320 nm, corresponding to the band gap of \u223c3.88 eV. In comparison, Fig. 5 indicates that the as-prepared Ta2O5 nanofibers have a red-shift band edge at 326 nm, which corresponds to a relative narrow band gap of 3.8 eV. This clearly suggests that the semiconductor materials fabricated by different synthesis methods may exhibit a variety of light absorption properties and energy band structures. Fig. 6 displays the photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production from 20 vol% methanol aqueous solution and pure water of the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers, as well as the Ta2O5 nanofibers, the NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers prepared by a one-step electrospinning method, the mechanically mixed sample of NaTaO3 and Ta2O5 nanofibers and the NaTaO3 nanofibers under simulant solar light irradiation. From Fig. 6a, it can be easily observed that among all the tested photocatalytic materials, the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity of 1579 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121 without any cocatalysts, which is 3.1 times larger than that of Ta2O5 nanofibers, and 10.5 times as large as that of NaTaO3 nanofibers. This is in sharp contrast with the fact that most of the photocatalytic materials reported so far usually require the participation of expensive cocatalysts (NiO and Pt, etc.) to acquire high photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production , and implies a possibility that well-defined heteostructures do not need the modification of co-catalysts. Fig. 6b shows the photocatalytic activities for hydrogen production in water of all tested samples. The trend is similar to that obtained in methanol aqueous solution and the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers also exhibits the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. In order to clear the origin of the enhanced photocatalytic activity, the BET surface areas of the facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers and the contrastive NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers are estimated, respectively, to be 10.7 and 16.0 m2 g\u22121 by N2 adsorption-desorption analysis (Fig. S5). The facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers exhibits the far higher photocatalytic activity than that of NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers, even though it has the smaller surface area. The result sufficiently illustrates that besides surface area, the reduced interface defects and the minimum charge transfer resistance of the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructures for effective charge separation are the essential factors for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. According to the previous reports, the conduction band (CB) bottom of NaTaO3 is slightly higher than that of Ta2O5 . Under simulant solar light irradiation the photogenerated electrons located on the CB bottom of NaTaO3 can transfer to the CB of Ta2O5 because of the potential gradient shown in Fig. 7 a. This greatly enhances the charge separation efficiencies and prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers of the two heterostructures. As a consequence, both the facet-coupling and composite heterostructures exhibit relatively high photocatalytic activities compared with single Ta2O5 and NaTaO3 as well as the mechanically mixed sample. For the two heterostructures, their charge separation behaviors are characterized by the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra (Fig. 7b) since PL emission results from their recombination . Compared with the contrast NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers, the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructures exhibit a lower PL emission intensity, suggesting that the as-prepared facet-coupling heterotructures have a relatively low recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. As these two kinds of samples are the same except from the interface structures, it can be reasonably inferred that the facet-coupling interfaces benefit the acceleration of the charge transfer from NaTaO3 to Ta2O5, resulting in the further enhancement of the charge separation efficiency of heterostructures because of the effectively reduced interface defects and the minimum charge transfer resistance. The charge transfer process of the facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers is analyzed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For comparison, the contrastive NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite and NaTaO3 nanofibers are also characterized. Fig. 8 a shows the Bode plots of the three samples. It can be clearly observed that the resistances decrease gradually and the phase angles exhibit three peaks with the increment of frequencies from 1 to 106 Hz. The Bode magnitude plots are remarkably different in the frequency region from 101 to 104 Hz. Since the three working electrodes all consist of the same carbon cloth but with different samples, this dramatic difference among the resistances suggests the different charge transfer process of the samples, which can be further verified by the fitting results of the corresponding equivalent circuit model. The occurrence of the three peaks in the Bode phase angle plots (the inset of Fig. 8a) implies that the samples all have three time constants when frequency is increased from 1 to 106 Hz. As each time constant implies a charge transfer process and is represented by a resistance capacitance (RC) parallel circuit , an equivalent circuit model can be reasonably proposed, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8b. Hereinto, Rs is the solution resistance. R1 and C1 stand for the resistance and double layer capacitance at the electrolyte/sample interface. R2 and CPE represent the charge transport resistance and the chemical capacitance of the as-prepared samples, while R3 and C2 imply the resistance and capacitance at the sample/electrode interface. Using this equivalent circuit model to statistically fit the Nyquist plots in Fig. 8b, the charge transfer resistances (R2) of the as-prepared facet-coupling NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers and NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers as well as NaTaO3 nanofibers are calculated to be 10.7, 33.4 and 162.1 ohm, respectively. The smallest R2 of the facet-coupling NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "indicates its more efficient charge transfer than those of NaTaO3/Ta2O5 composite nanofibers and NaTaO3. This can be well explained by the well-fabricated interfacial structure of the facet-coupling NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers, which is able to provide more effective electron pathways and decrease the charge transfer resistance, and thus further enhance the photocatalytic efficiencies of heterostructures . Fig. 9 shows the stability of the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers in 20 vol% methanol aqueous solution under simulant solar light irradiation. Obviously, the decrease in the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production is undiscernible in our experiment, indicating that the as-prepared facet-coupling NaTaO3/Ta2O5 heterostructured photocatalyst exhibits a good long-term stability. This is because besides the good chemical stability and photochemical inertness of both NaTaO3 and Ta2O5, the electron acceptor Ta2O5 cannot be reduced by the transferred electrons due to its much lower reduction potential (\u22120.75 V).  In summary, we have developed a synchronous etching-epitaxial growth approach for the fabrication of facet-coupling hetreostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 porous nanofibers by regulating the etching rate of Ta2O5 nanofibers to match with the heterogeneous nucleation and growth rate of NaTaO3 nanocubes. In the as-prepared facet-coupling hetreostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 porous nanofibers, the fragments of NaTaO3 nanocubes uniformly grow along [1 2 1] on the Ta2O5 (1 1 0) crystal plane under a solvothermal condition. Compared to the traditional heterostructures with crystal planes of the semiconducting components randomly contacting, the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructured NaTaO3/Ta2O5 nanofibers have an intrinsic advantage of much low lattice mismatch. The as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructures have reduced interface defects and a minimized charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the as-prepared facet-coupling heterostructures not only exhibit an increased light absorption capacity, but also an accelerated charge transfer between the interfaces, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability for hydrogen production without any co-catalysts under the simulant solar light irradiation. It is the first time to concentrate on the regulation of interfacial structures of heterostructures, which promises a reliable way to achieve the improvement of photoinduced charge separation and the acceleration of charge transfer for photocatalysis, photoelectrochemistry and electrochemistry. The synchronous etching-epitaxial growth approach reported here provides a simple and feasible approach to fabricate semiconductor\u2013semiconductor heterostructures with coupled crystalline facets in a liquid phase.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Among them, SERS, capable of magnifying the Raman signal and providing abundant molecular structural information, has been widely used in biosensing [6\u20138], drug detection [9], anti-counterfeiting [10], and other fields. The SERS performance is determined by the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement, deriving from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanostructures. Various structures have been exploited as high-performance SERS substrates, such as nanoparticles [11,12], micro/nano arrays [13\u201321], and hybrid systems [22\u201324]. Methods for achieving high enhancement factor (EF) and different morphology design of SERS substrates have been extensively studied [25\u201329]. Nevertheless, most of them can only provide LSPR in a narrow range. It is still a problem to design different particular morphologies to match the excitation wavelength for achieving the best SERS performance. To alleviate the problem, three-dimensional (3D) plasmonic structures with broadband absorption have been engineered [30\u201334]. For example, Shi et al. fabricated 3D metamaterial based on anodic aluminum oxide membrane to improve the light-matter interaction for ultrabroadband SERS analysis [35]. Mao et al. designed a nanoparticle-in-nanobowl structure by employing template metal deposition, e-beam evaporation, and gas-phase deposition, providing a single molecule SERS capability [36]. Nie et al. designed broadband nanolaminate nanocavities on nanopillars by nanoimprint, multiple depositions of Ag and SiO2, and wet etching [37]. Dedelaite et al. developed a hybrid plasmonic/photonic structure for multiwavelength-sensitive SERS detection [22]. However, complicated fabrication process and expensive equipment are required in most of these works, undermining the practical applications of broadband SERS substrates. Another problem for SERS substrates is angle-dependence, of which the works are scarce and highly desirable in practical applications. To extend the universality of SERS substrates under tilting and bending conditions, Zhao et al. fabricated honeycomb nanoarrays on polystyrene (PS) spheres that showed angle-insensitive SERS property. But this structure could work at a specific wavelength due to its narrow LSPR [38]. To realize both broadband and omnidirectional SERS performance, Ding et al. prepared bioinspired Ag brochosomes by twice nanosphere assembly, thermal evaporation, and template-mediated electrochemical growth [39]. Zhu et al. prepared broadband and omnidirectional plasmonic nanovoid arrays by nanosphere assembly, annealing, and multiple depositions [40]. However, the fabrication processes of these structures are cumbersome and time-consuming, limiting their commercial applications. Besides, these structures are all based on PS spheres and can\u2019t exhibit distinct undulating morphology. Their stability might be poor because the closely packed PS sphere monolayer were self-assembled at the liquid\u2013air interface by capillary force [41]. As per our knowledge, only a handful of works can realize both angle-insensitive and broadband SERS performance on one substrate [39,40]. There should be further exploration of Raman substrates with both broadband and angle-insensitive performance for accommodating practical application scenarios. Here, 3D hierarchical plasmonic structures (HPSs) of perforating microcone arrays were fabricated via colloidal lithography [42,43] for realizing broadband and angle-insensitive SERS analysis. Integration of nanocavities and microcone arrays endows the HPSs with angle-insensitive light-trapping capability in a wide wavelength range (350\u00a0nm \u2212 1000\u00a0nm). Numerical simulations proved that enhanced EM field around the nanocavities is beneficial to SERS enhancement. Obvious and stable Raman signals were observed within wide incident angle variation, as well as in a broad excitation wavelength range, including 532\u00a0nm, 633\u00a0nm, and 785\u00a0nm, verifying the angle-insensitive and broadband SERS property of HPSs. At last, quantitative and sensitive detection of toxic residues was realized by the optimal HPSs. The light-trapping HPSs with broadband and angle-insensitive SERS activity are envisioned to be advantageous to expand wider application scope.  Fig. 1 a depicts the fabrication scheme of hierarchical plasmonic structures (HPSs). First, polystyrene (PS) microsphere (with diameter of 3\u00a0\u03bcm) monolayer was assembled on a PS-coated substrate (Fig. S1) and applied by oxygen reactive ion etching (RIE). The PS microspheres and the PS film underneath were simultaneously etched and microcone arrays were obtained. Next, the 80\u00a0nm-thick Au nanohole array (Au NHA) mask was transferred onto the as-prepared microcone arrays and RIE was carried out to etch the microcone arrays. The fabrication of Au NHA mask is depicted in detail in Supporting Information and Fig. S2. After removing the Au NHA film and depositing 50-nm Ag, HPSs were obtained. Definition of the main structural parameters is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image displays ordered PS microcone arrays (Fig. 1b). The diameter (d1), height (h1), and period (p1) are 2.0\u00a0\u03bcm, 2.4\u00a0\u03bcm, and 3\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. Fig. 1c shows that the Au NHA mask with period of 300\u00a0nm and diameter of 180\u00a0nm was successfully transferred onto the PS microcone arrays. Due to the strong rigidity of 80-nm Au, the Au NHA film is suspended on the substrate with only slight bend around the tips of the microcones. In general, the Au NHA remains nearly flawless and perfect after transferring, which is a reliable mask for the following RIE process. The side-view SEM image in Fig. 1d shows that the nanocavities with period (p2) of 300\u00a0nm and diameter (d2) of 260\u00a0nm are successfully formed both in microcones and the flat film between the adjacent microcones. The depth (D) of nanocavities can be tuned by RIE duration. It is noted that all the geometric parameters can be well regulated by adjusting relevant experimental conditions. To investigate the morphology of HPSs, tilting SEM images of the HPSs after different RIE durations are displayed in Fig. 2 . Due to the characteristic tapered profile of microcone, the perforated nanocavities are more like elliptical holes. The depth (D) of the nanocavities can be controlled by the RIE duration. For the short etching duration t\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0min, the perforations in microcones and PS flat film are both too shallow to form suitable nanocavities (Fig. 2a). Obvious nanocavities appear after 4\u00a0min etching with D\u00a0=\u00a0620\u00a0nm in the microcones, and D\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0nm in the flat film (Fig. 2b). For t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0min, nanocavities become wider and deeper, leading to thinner sidewalls between the adjacent nanocavities and forming sharp edges, which. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "would function as multiple hot spots to enhance EM field (Fig. 2c). The depth of nanocavities is about 820\u00a0nm in the microcones, and 280\u00a0nm in the flat film (details were shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1). This difference of the depth between the nanocavities in the microcones and the nanocavities in the flat film might be attributed to the different geometries of cone and flat film, and their different distances to the Au NHA mask. For t\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0min (Fig. 2d), excessive etching makes the edges sharper but incomplete. Most of the nanocavities in the flat film disappear and the microcones apparently become slimmer. Thus, the HPSs with t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0min would be the optimal candidate substrate for SERS analysis due to the sharp edges and perfect nanocavities in the whole substrate. The EDX mapping in Fig. S4 indicates that Ag is uniformly distributed throughout the surface of the microcones and interior of nanocavities (t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0min). Fig. 3 a shows the reflection spectra of the HPSs with different etching durations (HPS2, HPS4, HPS6, and HPS8 represent the HPSs with t\u00a0=\u00a02, 4, 6, and 8\u00a0min, respectively), Ag microcone arrays and Ag nanohole arrays. The 300\u00a0nm-thick Ag flat film on glass substrate was adopted as reference and its reflectivity is nearly 100\u00a0% (Fig. S5). The reflection of HPS2 is below 15\u00a0% in the visible-near infrared region, which is much lower than those of microcone arrays and nanohole arrays. The reflection of HPS4 is less than 5.8\u00a0% (350\u00a0nm \u2212 1000\u00a0nm) due to that the depth of the nanocavities increases. Broadband low reflection (less than2.2\u00a0%) is achieved by HPS6 due to the optimal nanocavities both in the microcones and the flat film, indicating that the incident photons are efficiently captured. For HPS8, the reflection shows an obvious increase but is still lower than 7.5\u00a0%, because most nanocavities in the flat film were destroyed. Therefore, HPS6 shows the best light-capture property. Noted that the antireflection performance of the optimum HPSs (i.e., HPS6) is comparable with some recent researches [44\u201348]. While the antireflection of HPS6 is not the best, the light-trapping ability is still favorable for Raman enhancement (details were displayed in Table S2). Besides, to investigate polarization dependence, the reflection of HPS6 at normal incidence under transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarized light was simulated in Fig. S6. A similar trend under TM and TE polarized light can be observed in the region of 300\u00a0nm \u2212 780\u00a0nm. Although a discrepancy appears around 900\u00a0nm, the whole reflectivity is still less than 12.6\u00a0% in the region of 300\u00a0nm \u2212 1000\u00a0nm. The optical property of HPS6 was studied at different incident angles \u03b8 (which refers to the angle between the incident light and the normal of substrate) in Fig. 3b. Specifically, the reflection persists below 5\u00a0% in the 350\u00a0nm \u2212 900\u00a0nm region as \u03b8 increases to 45\u00b0. When \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a060\u00b0, the reflection of HPS6 maintains less than 10\u00a0%. Therefore, the reflection of HPS6 is insensitive to the incident angle \u03b8. The calculated reflection spectra also demonstrate that the HPS6 can remain low reflection (less than9.2\u00a0%) in a wide range as \u03b8 varied from 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 (Fig. S7). Such broadband and omnidirectional optical property arises from three factors: (i) the characteristic geometry of microcone supports a gradual change of effective refractive index between PS and air, thereby preventing the Fresnel reflection [48\u201350]. The effective refractive index can be expressed as [51] neff=[nair21-f+nPS2f]1/2 where n air and n PS refer to the air and PS refractive indexes, and f is the filling factor. The calculated effective refractive index shows gradual profile as microcone height increases (Fig. S8). (ii) the LSPR of nanocavities provides effective incident light absorbance (to be shown in Fig. 4 ) [19,36,52,53]. (iii) the distribution of the nanocavities in a 3D configuration increases the utilization of light in the 3D space [34,54]. Therefore, our HPSs are extremely envisioned to be advantageous for practical applications requiring broadband and angle-insensitive optical properties, such as solar energy harvesting [2] and SERS. EM field distribution of the HPS6 (the optimal HPSs), microcone arrays, and nanohole arrays is calculated in Fig. 4. Detailed simulation models can be seen in Fig. S9. Due to the LSPR of the nanocavities [19,53], strong EM field is distributed around the nanocavities both in the flat film and the microcones (Fig. 4a and b). Specifically, hot spots mainly appear at the sharp edges with small curvature radius, inner walls, and the nanocavities\u2019 interiors. As a control, the microcone array only provides a hot spot at the tip, which occupies a tiny proportion of the whole substrate volume (Fig. 4c). The enhanced EM field of the nanohole arrays is mainly distributed at the edge of nanoholes in a two-dimensional (2D) manner (Fig. 4d). The EM field enhancement of HPS6 is 200\u00a0% higher than that of the nanohole arrays. Therefore, the density and intensity of the hot spots of HPS6 are the largest compared to those of microcone arrays and nanohole arrays. The EM field of HPS6 under different incident angles was calculated in Fig. S10. Despite there are some differences in the strongest EM field distribution under different incident angles, the majority of hot spots are located around the sharp edges, further demonstrating that the optimal HPSs can provide significant EM field within a wide incident angle variation. To verify that the strong EM field of the light-trapping HPSs is conducive to SERS enhancement, SERS signals on different structures using 10\u22126 M PATP ethanol solution at 633\u00a0nm excitation wavelength were measured in Fig. 5 a. The microcone arrays and nanohole arrays with the same size as HPSs were adopted as the control groups. For HPSs, the Raman intensity at 1140\u00a0cm\u22121 is enhanced with etching duration increasing (Fig. 5b), reaching the most significant enhancement on HPS6 substrate due to the appropriate nanocavities modification. Specifically, there is only a slight enhancement of HPS2 as compared to that of the microcone arrays, because the nanocavities are too shallow to capture enough light and form sharp edges for providing multiple hot spots (which also. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "can be seen in Fig. 2a). The Raman intensity decreases when t\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0min because the nanocavities are incomplete after excessive anisotropic etching. The Raman intensity on the optimum HPSs (i.e., HPS6) is about 8 and 13 times larger than those on microcone arrays and nanohole arrays, respectively. Therefore, HPS6 shows the best SERS performance as it features outstanding light-trapping property, multiple hot spots and large surface area to adsorb more analytes in the 3D space [26]. To explore the Raman sensitivity of HPS6, Raman spectra were further tested by varying the PATP concentrations (10\u22127 M \u2212 10\u221217 M) in Fig. 5c. The characteristic peaks can be identified even when the concentration decreased to 10\u221217 M, demonstrating that HPS6 is promising for trace detection. As shown in Fig. 5d, the good linear fitting (regression coefficient R 2\u00a0=\u00a00.989) between SERS intensity at 1140\u00a0cm\u22121 and PATP concentrations confirms that HPS6 is a good substrate for sensitive and quantitative Raman analysis. The enhancement factor (EF) of HPS6 was deduced to be 5.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 (details can be seen in Fig. S11), which compares favorably with the state-of-the-art SERS substrates (detailed comparisons can be seen in Table S3, Supporting Information) [50,55\u201357]. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of Raman signals (at 1140\u00a0cm\u22121) on HPS6 periodic substrate is about 5.74\u00a0%, which is much lower than the scientific standard (20\u00a0%) (Fig. S12) [58]. This result demonstrates that the Raman signals display good homogeneity and repeatability on the HPS6 sample. The slight variation of Raman peak intensity on two different HPS6 samples also confirms the stability and reliability of HPS6 for detecting different analytes in Raman measurement (more details are shown in Fig. S13). In addition to the contribution of EM field enhancement, the 3D periodic HPSs provide a larger surface area for adsorbing more target analytes than two-dimensional (2D) metal structures and nanoparticle-based SERS substrate, which is also conducive to the homogeneity and stability of Raman performance [3,7,25,59]. The angle-dependence of SERS performance was studied in Fig. 6 . The schematics of the Raman measurement at tilting angles \u03b1 for the nanohole arrays, the microcone arrays, and HPS6 are depicted in Fig. 6a, 6b, and 6c, respectively. As a control, the SERS intensity on nanohole arrays shows a dramatic downward trend as \u03b1 increases (Fig. 6d and 6\u00a0h). Raman signals are hard to be distinguished when \u03b1 increases to 45\u00b0 and no signals can be distinguished at 60\u00b0. For the microcone arrays, Raman intensity declines with the increase of \u03b1 and decreases about 49.9\u00a0% at 60\u00b0 (Fig. 6e and 6i). Although the typical Raman peaks on the microcone arrays can be distinguished at 60\u00b0, the Raman intensity consistency at different tilting angles is lower than that on HPS6. In striking contrast, HPS6 displays slight Raman intensity deviations (6.1\u00a0% at 1140\u00a0cm\u22121 and 7.6\u00a0% at 1438\u00a0cm\u22121) when incident angle \u03b1 changes (Fig. 6f and 6\u00a0g). Such angle-insensitive SERS property of HPS6 arises from the omnidirectional light-capture capability and strong EM field (Fig. 3 and Fig. S10). The angle-insensitive SERS property implies that HPSs hold potential for on-field detection which is difficult to precisely regulate the laser light normal to substrate [38,39]. To demonstrate the broadband sensing response, Raman signals of PATP on HPS6 substrate were investigated under wavelengths of 532\u00a0nm, 633\u00a0nm, and 785\u00a0nm (Fig. 7 ). In contrast, the nanohole arrays show discernible Raman signals at 532\u00a0nm, very weak signals at 633\u00a0nm, and no typical Raman signals at 785\u00a0nm wavelength (gray line in Fig. 7a-c). The microcone arrays display observable Raman signals under 532\u00a0nm and 633\u00a0nm, and weak signals under 785\u00a0nm. While for HPS6, obvious typical Raman signals can be seen under all the three wavelengths. Fig. 7d-f show that the EM field of HPS6 are strongly enhanced at the sharp edges and internal sidewalls at all the three excitations including 532\u00a0nm, 633\u00a0nm, and 785\u00a0nm, which is consistent with the broadband SERS activity of HPSs. In other words, HPS6 has broadband light absorbance and pronounced EM field, thus realizing the SERS analysis flexibility at \u201call\u201d available laser wavelengths, simplifying complicated design of different plasmonic structures to match with excitation wavelengths. In brief, the HPSs with angle-insensitive and broadband SERS activity might raise the prospect of versatile and practical Raman applications. To extend the practicability of the optimized HPSs, HPS6 was employed for residuum detection. Thiram, a pesticide, has been widely used in the plant pathogen and pest control. However, its residues accumulation in food can induce harmful effects on human health and environment [60,61]. Here, we analyzed thiram at different concentrations under 633\u00a0nm excitation wavelength in Fig. 8 a. The thiram was spiked into mineral water with concentration ranging from 10\u22123 M to 10\u22127 M. SERS intensity declines as the thiram concentration decreases. A typical Raman signal at 1374\u00a0cm\u22121 is obviously discernible even at low concentration (10\u22127 M) [11,12,62,63], which is far below the maximum residue limit of China\u02bcs national food safety standard (5\u00a0mg/L) [32,54,64]. Raman intensity at 1374\u00a0cm\u22121 is positively correlated to thiram concentrations with determination coefficient R 2 of 0.988 (Fig. 8b), proving that HPS6 can quantitatively detect thiram pesticide residues. (SERS sensitivity of recent works were listed in Table S3.) Crystal violet (CV) is a common toxic dye applied in textile and printing industrial fields. Due to its high toxicity and long degradation time, it is of great importance to detect CV residue in water [65,66]. Fig. 8c depicts the Raman signals of CV in mineral water (10\u22124 M \u2212 10\u22129 M) under 532\u00a0nm excitation wavelength. Characteristic Raman signals at 912\u00a0cm\u22121, 1175\u00a0cm\u22121, 1586\u00a0cm\u22121, and 1620\u00a0cm\u22121 are distinctly identified even when the concentration is 10\u22129 M, which is below the standard detection limits of the European Union (2\u00a0mg/L) [67,68], confirming the capability of HPS6 for CV trace detection. Fig. 8d shows the good linear fitting (R 2\u00a0=\u00a00.980) between SERS intensity and CV concentration. Besides, Raman signals of CV with different concentrations under 633\u00a0nm excitation wavelength were also measured in Fig. S14, showing ultrasensitive and quantitative SERS performance. These results indicate that the optimal HPSs are feasible to sensitively detect chemical residues.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", " In conclusion, hierarchical plasmonic structures (HPSs) with angle-insensitive and broadband SERS activity were fabricated via a well-developed colloidal lithography. By integrating nanocavities with microcone arrays, the HPSs allow omnidirectional and broadband light capture, thus realizing high and stable Raman performance within wide incident angle variations, as well as at different excitation wavelengths. Such versatility significantly simplifies the sophisticated design for diverse SERS structures to fit diverse excitations and reduces the cost (more details can be seen in SI). The optimized HPSs show excellent sensitivity and uniformity (RSD: 5.75\u00a0%). At last, chemical residues analysis was demonstrated by the optimized HPSs, with minimum detection limit down to 10\u22127 M for thiram and 10\u22129 M for crystal violet. The HPSs promise good potential for practical implementation requiring light harvesting, such as on-field Raman detection, solar water purification, perovskite solar cells and so on.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apt.2014.12.013.txt", "paper": ["Due to increasing concerns about global warming, the development of clean, accessible, and sustainable resources has received much attention [1]. Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity, and it is the most noteworthy among sustainable energy resources because of its global availability. Recent reports from the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) have estimated that by 2100, 60% of consumed energy may be obtained from solar energy [2]. Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), proposed by O\u2019Regan and Gr\u00e4tzel [3], is one of the photoelectric chemical solar cells, and it is an attractive alternative because of its properties, such as low production cost and low environmental impact during fabrication [4\u20137]. Several innovative methods using the carbonaceous materials were recently presented to enhance the power conversion efficiency (\u03b7) of DSSC. For example, a triangular structure among the particles of TiO2, carbon black, and dye was presented to help the electron excitation of the alizarin yellow [8]. A light scattering layer of carbon spheres/TiO2 nanoparticle composites was used to enhance the light harvest efficiency (LHE) of the photo-anode and the performance of the DSSC [9]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were applied to the working electrode [10\u201314] or the counter electrode [15,16] to enhance the performance of a DSSC due to their unique properties (such as good electric conductivity and high effective surface area) [10]. Aside from above carbonaceous materials, meso-porous carbon has recently been applied to the counter electrode for enhancing the \u03b7 of DSSC [17,18] due to its accessible porosity, high surface area, and high electrical conductivity [17]. However, less attention has been paid to the application of meso-porous carbon, such as bamboo charcoal (BC), in the working electrode to facilitate LHE. In addition, bamboo, which is found in diverse climates from cold mountains to tropical or subtropical regions, is the most notable among biomass resources because it is one of the fastest growing plants on Earth [1]. Therefore, in this study, BC was prepared from 3 to 4 years old Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), and the bamboo charcoal powder (BCP) was then obtained by pulverizing BC. TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles were obtained by mixing BCP and TiO2 (P-25) nano-particles via the dry mixing method. These TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles were then applied to the working electrode of DSSC (Fig. 1 ). The effects of the BCP size and the mass ratio of TiO2 (P-25) to BCP on the \u03b7 of DSSC were investigated. A comparison of a DSSC with the proposed working electrode with the conventional DSSC with TiO2 (P-25) electrode was also made.  The bamboo culm was cleaned and chopped into segments of 3 cm \u00d7 15 cm. The moisture content of these chopped bamboo segments was kept at 10% by air drying. The carbonization process of BC is as follows: (1) the chopped bamboo segments were loaded into the chamber of a mechanical kiln; and (2) the chamber temperature was increased to 500 \u00b0C with a rate of 100 \u00b0C/h, and this temperature was retained for 1 h. BCP was obtained through the following steps: (1) Broken pieces of BC were dehydrated in a furnace at a temperature of 103 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C; (2) these dehydrated broken BC were loaded into a cross beater mill (Retsch SK100), and they were pulverized for a certain period; and (3) the BCP with a size of 90, 63, or 38 \u03bcm was obtained by sieving the pulverized BC in an analytical sieve shaker (Retsch AS200). The titanium dioxide (TiO2, Uniregion Biotech P-25) particles of 20% rutile and 80% anatase with an average particle size of 21 nm and the BCP with a size of 90, 63, or 38 \u03bcm were used to prepare TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles in the Mechanofusion system (Hosokawa Micron Corp. AMS-mini), whose specifications of Mechanofusion system were detailed in our previous works [7,19]. The mass ratios of TiO2 (P-25) to BCP included: (1) 10:0.2, (2) 10:0.4, and (3) 10:0.8. The dry mixing duration and the rotor speed were 1 h and 6000 rpm, respectively. Table 1 lists the test conditions under which the TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles were prepared. A digital camera (Panasonic DMC-LZ2) was used to obtain the photographs of the BC, BCP, TiO2 (P-25) particles, and TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles. A BET specific surface area analyzer (AF21023) was used to obtain the BET specific surface area of the BCP. Moreover, the micrographs of BC, BCP, and TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (HITACHI, 600-S). The procedure for fabricating a working electrode of TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles (Fig. 1) included: (1) preparation of the colloid by mixing TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles (1 g) with ethanol (4 mL), acetylacetone (0.4 mL), and Triton X-100 (0.05 mL); (2) deposition of colloid on top of a FTO-glass substrate with the TiCl4 treatment; (3) sintering of this substrate at 450 \u00b0C for 1 h in a high-temperature furnace (Table 2 ); and (4) immersion of this substrate with TiO2 (P-25)/BCP thin film into the solution of N-719 dye and ethyl alcohol at 70 \u00b0C for 6 h. In this study, using a spin coater (MSC 300D), the colloid of TiO2 (P-25)/BCP was deposited on top of a FTO-glass substrate using two-stage coating process: (1) in the 1st stage, the colloid was deposited with 1000 rpm for 10 s; and (2) the colloid was deposited again with 1500 rpm for 15 s in the 2nd stage. The process of preparing working electrode was detailed in our previous works [7,19]. Further, TiO2 (P-25) working electrodes were prepared following above process to show the advantage of BCP addition, compared with a conventional DSSC with a TiO2 (P-25) electrode. All samples were 0.25 cm2 in area. Prior to dipping the electrode in a dye solution, a SEM (HITACHI, 600-S) and an \u03b1-step surface profiler (Dekeak 6M) were used to obtain the micrograph and the thickness of the film on a FTO-glass substrate, respectively. Following soaking the substrate in a dye solution, an UV\u2013VIS\u2013NIR spectrophotometer (Jasco, V-600) was. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "used to investigate the absorbance of a dye-covered working electrode. Further, an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (Horiba EX-200) was used to obtain the weight and atomic percentages of elements in a dye-covered working electrode. The dye-covered working electrode was attached to a counter electrode covered with a platinum (Pt) film to form an open cell. We then injected a liquid electrolyte into the space between two electrodes, as outlined in our previous work [7]. An AM 1.5 solar simulator (San-Ei Pioneer of Light Technology, XES-310S) was used to illuminate the DSSC and a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) was used to obtain the Isc and Voc. Details of the calculations used to determine \u03b7 of the DSSC are also outlined in our previous study [7,19].  Fig. 2 shows the photographs of the BC, BCP, TiO2 (P-25) particles, and TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles. The color of TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles depended on the mass ratio of TiO2 (P-25) particles to BCP. Fig. 3 shows SEM micrographs and has four frames: (a) the top-left frame refers to the SEM micrograph of parenchyma cells of BC (1k\u00d7); (b) the top-right frame refers to the SEM micrograph of the parenchyma cell of BC (5k\u00d7); (c) the bottom-left frame refers to the SEM micrograph of BCP (1k\u00d7); and (d) the bottom-right frame refers to the SEM micrograph of BCP (5k\u00d7). The BET specific surface area of the BCP prepared in this study (at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h) was 44.6 m2/g. The reasons for carbonizing the Moso bamboo at 500 \u00b0C include: (1) normally, the hemicellulose is degraded at 200\u2013260 \u00b0C, the cellulose is degraded at 240\u2013350 \u00b0C, and the lignin is degraded at 280\u2013500 \u00b0C [20]; and (2) if the carbonization temperature is lower than 500 \u00b0C, the tar, which is formed by the degraded hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, etc. in the Moso bamboo, prohibits the formation of the porous structure in the BC. The pyrolysis of Moso bamboo during a carbonization process caused a porous carbonaceous structure. The carbonaceous structure became more porous with an increase in temperature, and the parenchyma cell wall BC became thinner. The formation of crevice in the parenchyma cell wall is one of the major mechanisms to promote the formation of the porous structure and increase the surface area of the charcoal [1]. Dubinin and Plavnik indicated that porous carbonaceous adsorbents usually contained three varieties of pores: macro-pores, transitional pores, and micro-pores [21], and the macro-pores always appear on the surface of the parenchyma cell [Fig. 3(b)]. In addition, Rodriguez-Reinoso reported that although most of the adsorption took place in the micro-pores of activated carbon, meso- and macro-pores served as passages for the adsorbate to the micro-pores [22]. The average thickness of the TiO2 film on the FTO-glass substrate was 17.75 \u03bcm (Table 3 ), and the average thickness of the TiO2 (P-25)/BCP film on the FTO-glass substrate ranged from 15.33 to 19.00 \u03bcm. Wang et al. reported that the optimum film thickness on the substrate for the dye (such as N719) ranged from 15 to 18 \u03bcm [23]. Fig. 4 shows cross-sectional SEM micrographs (3500\u00d7) and EDS analyses of working electrode including the BCP with an average size of 63 \u03bcm in Test C5 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.2), Test C6 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.4), and Test C7 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.8). As mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP changed from 10:0.2 to 10:0.8, the weight percentage of carbon increased from 0.40% to 5.35%. Fig. 5 (a) and (b) shows SEM micrographs (5k\u00d7) and EDS analyses of the surface of the dye-covered working electrodes in Test C1 [TiO2 (P-25) electrode] and Test C9 [TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode including the BCP with an average size of 38 \u03bcm], respectively; the mass ratio of TiO2 (P-25) to BCP was 10:0.4. The weight percentage of ruthenium (Ru) in the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode (0.98%) exceeded that of the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25) electrode (0.62%). This can be attributed to the fact that these porous BCP dispersed in the TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode could absorb more dye as the electrode was immersed in the solution of dye. Fig. 6 (a) shows variations in absorbance with the wavelength of light for dye-covered working electrodes in Tests C1 [TiO2 (P-25) electrode], C5 [TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.2)], C6 [TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.4)], and C7 [TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.8)], in which BCP has an average size of 63 \u03bcm. Fig. 6(b) shows variations in absorbance with the wavelength of light for dye-covered working electrodes in Tests C1 [TiO2 (P-25) electrode], C8 [TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.2)], C9 [TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.4)], and C10 [TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.8)], in which BCP has an average size of 38 \u03bcm. With a suitable mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP (such as 10:0.4 or 10:0.8), the absorbance of the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode in Tests C6, C7, C9, and C10 exceeded that of the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25) electrode in Test C1 at the wavelength ranging from 300 to 800 nm [Fig. 6(a) and (b)]. This can be attributed to the fact that the addition of a certain amount of porous BCP enhances the absorption of dye. In addition, a larger weight percentage of BCP in a dye-covered electrode corresponds to a larger absorbance of visible light. For example, at the wavelength of light ranging from 400 to 800 nm, the absorbance of dye-covered TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode in Tests C7 or C10 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.8) exceeded that of dye-covered TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode in Test C6 or C9 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.4) [Fig. 6(a) and (b)]. This can be explained by the fact that a TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode with a larger weight percentage of porous BCP has a better capability of dye absorption. The variations in photocurrent density with photovoltage are shown in Fig. 7 (a) (in Tests D1, D5, D6, and D7) and Fig. 7(b) (in Tests D1, D8, D9, and D10). Table 3 shows the Voc, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the fill factor (FF), the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "\u03b7, and the efficiency per thickness of the DSSC in Tests D1 to D10. The highest Jsc was 17.82 mA/cm2, and the highest \u03b7 was 5.40%. At a fixed average size of BCP, the \u03b7 of DSSC increases with an increase in the weight percentage of BCP in a TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode increases. However, if the weight percentage of BCP exceeds a threshold, the \u03b7 of DSSC then decreases. For example, at a fixed average size of BCP (63 \u03bcm), as the mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP changed from 10:0.2 to 10:0.4, the \u03b7 of DSSC increased from 3.30% (Test D5) to 4.98% (Test D6). Then, as the mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP changed from 10:0.4 to 10:0.8, the \u03b7 of DSSC decreased from 4.98% (Test D6) to 3.71% (Test D7) even though at the wavelength of light ranging from 400 to 800 nm, the absorbance of the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode in Test C7 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.8) exceeded that of the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode in Test C6 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.4) [Fig. 6(a)]. This can be explained by the following. In this study, the chopped bamboo segments were carbonized at 500 \u00b0C for 1 h, the volatile compounds were nearly thermally decomposed, and a porous carbonaceous structure accompanied by the other elements was gradually formed. Therefore, a larger weight percentage of the porous BCP in the TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode had a better capability of dye absorption. However, with a fixed average size of BCP, a larger weight percentage of porous BCP in the TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode may decrease the rate of electron transportation. This can be supported by the fact that the Jsc substantially decreased from 16.07 mA/cm2 in Test D6 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.4) to 11.53 mA/cm2 in Test D7 (TiO2:BCP = 10:0.8), as shown in Table 3. This drawback may be improved by increasing the carbonization temperature because if the temperature is about 1500 \u00b0C, the carbonaceous structure of BC will be fully developed, the weight percentage of carbon and the number of \u03c0 electron will generally be increased in BC, and the electric resistance of BC will then be decreased [24]. Aside from this, Zhang reported that a higher weight percentage of carbon nano-particles in the composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) was unfavorable for the ionic conductivity and the electronic conductive path [25]. At a fixed mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP, the \u03b7 of DSSC increases with a decrease in the average size of BCP. For example, at a fixed mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP (10:0.4), as the average size of BCP decreased from 63 to 38 \u03bcm, the Jsc increased from 16.07 mA/cm2 (Test D6) to 17.82 mA/cm2 (Test D9), and the \u03b7 of DSSC increased from 4.98% to 5.40%. This can be attributed to the following facts: (1) at a fixed mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP, the particle number of BCP with a smaller size was larger than that of BCP with a bigger size; and (2) these BCP with a smaller size could be more homogeneously dispersed in the TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode, so it might be favorable for the transportation of the excited electrons. With an appropriate mass ratio of TiO2 to BCP, the \u03b7 of the DSSC with a TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode substantially exceeds that of the conventional DSSC with a TiO2 (P-25) electrode. For example, the values of \u03b7 in Test D1 [DSSC with a TiO2 (P-25) electrode] and in Test D9 [DSSC with a TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode] were 3.60% and 5.40%, respectively. Further, the Jsc increased from 9.01 mA/cm2 (Test D1) to 17.82 mA/cm2 (Test D9), as shown in Table 3. This result may be attributed to the following facts: (1) the porous BCP embedded in the matrix of nano-crystalline TiO2 (P-25) particles facilitated the capability of dye absorption and the generation of electrons during exposure to the light, and it can be supported by the fact that the weight percentage of element Ru in the dye-covered working electrode in Test C9 (0.98%) substantially exceeded that in the dye-covered working electrode in Test C1 (0.62%), as shown in Fig. 5; and (2) the absorbance of the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode in Test C9 exceeded that of the dye-covered TiO2 (P-25) electrode in Test C1 at the wavelength ranging from 300 to 800 nm [Fig. 6(b)].  The porous BCP was prepared from bamboo, which is one of the fastest growing plants on Earth. TiO2 (P-25)/BCP composite particles were prepared using a dry mixing method and applied in the working electrode of DSSC. A larger weight percentage of porous BCP in the dye-covered working electrode may enhance the absorbance of light, but an abundant amount of BCP may be unfavorable for the transportation of excited electrons because the carbonization temperature used in this study (500 \u00b0C) cannot substantially increase the BET specific area of BC and reduce the electric resistance in BC. Therefore, increasing the BET specific surface area and the conductivity of BC through raising the carbonization temperature is one of the promising methods to promote the \u03b7 of a DSSC with a TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode, and optimum conditions of preparing a TiO2 (P-25)/BCP electrode are worthy of continued study.

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apmt.2019.07.018.txt", "paper": ["Among metal oxide semiconductors, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has shown to be the one of the most efficient, non-toxic, chemically and photochemically stable material (under long-term exposure to irradiation) for electrochemical applications such as a hydrogen evolution [,], photocatalysis [], and dye sensitized and hybrid solar cells [,]. In order to enhance the photoactivity, TiO2 has been produced in many forms, namely, nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods or self-organized nanotube layers with consequence on the total surface area and photogeneration of electron-hole pairs with a sufficiently high concentration []. Especially, the latter mentioned one-dimensional (1D), ordered nanostructures offer the advantage of directed charge transport as well as a long lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers. The major limitation of the outstanding performance of pure TiO2 is its absorption in the UV light spectral region (the band gap of TiO2 in the anatase phase is 3.2\u202feV) and thus only a small portion of the solar spectrum can be efficiently harvested. To overcome this drawback, additional engineering of TiO2 via doping with metals [] or non-metals [], anodic reduction [,], creation of black TiO2 [,], using of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles [,] and coating of TiO2 by secondary materials with lower bandgap [] was used to shift the light absorption into the visible spectral region. Recently, non-metal doping has been found as one of the consistent ways how to desirably tune the band gap of TiO2. In contrast to metal doping, that typically induces extra recombination centres as well as low thermal stability [], the incorporation of N, C, chalcogenides or halides circumvents the aforementioned shortcomings and thus essentially improves the solar light conversion efficiency. For instance, sulfur doped (S-doped) TiO2 nanoparticles have shown substantially enhanced photocatalytic performance, when operated in the visible (VIS) spectral region []. Based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the VIS spectral region photoactivity of S-doped TiO2 exclusively originates from the substitution of Ti or O atoms by S atoms, whereas incorporation of S atoms into the interstitial position has been proven to be energetically unfavourable []. In addition, in the case of Ti-rich TiO2, S atoms should predominantly enter into the anion sub-lattice, creating new energy levels within the bandgap. However, experimental findings by XPS have disclosed that S atoms in TiO2 mainly prefer the cation substitution S4+/S6+ in the form of SO3 2\u2212/SO4 2\u2212, rather than the anion counterpart S2\u2212, probably due to the larger anionic radius of S2\u2212 in comparison to that of O2\u2212 []. Also, the cation substitution generates the red shift of the absorption edge and thus enhances the VIS spectral region photoactivity. It has been reported that the presence of both cationic and anionic S species strongly depends on the preparation conditions. For example, S-doped TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by means of annealing of TiS2 nanoparticles in air showed residual S2\u2212 units [], whereas S4+/S6+ are the characteristic features after the sol-gel synthesis from titanium (IV) isopropoxide and thiourea [] or H2SO4 [] precursors or via sulfidation of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles in gaseous H2S []. To our knowledge, the research of S-doped TiO2 in terms of increased photoactivity has been mainly performed on nanoparticles, while only a brief report on sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers via H2S at 380\u202f\u00b0C or 500\u202f\u00b0C has been shown [,,]. Recently, TiO2 nanotube layers sulfurized at 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh were successfully employed as electrode of lithium\u2013ion microbatteries [,]. However, a systematic study on sulfur treated 1D ordered TiO2 nanostructures, such as self-organized TiO2 nanotube layers, has not been conducted yet. To close this gap, we optimized sulfurization conditions in the temperature range from 250 to 450\u202f\u00b0C at different durations to achieve the maximum photocurrent collection, yet protecting the structural integrity of the nanotubes. We also present potential applications of the sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers for the photocatalytic decomposition of the methylene blue aqueous solution and for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.  Prior to anodization, the Ti foils (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.127\u202fmm, 99.7% purity) were degreased by sonication in isopropanol and acetone, then rinsed with isopropanol and dried in air. The electrochemical setup consisted of a two-electrode configuration using a platinum foil as the counter electrode, while the Ti substrates (working electrodes) were pressed against an O-ring of the electrochemical cell, leaving 1\u202fcm2 opening exposed to the electrolyte. Ti foils of a size of 0.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fcm2 were used as working electrodes for the production of TiO2 nanotube layers on stripes. Electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature employing a high-voltage potentiostat (PGU-200\u202fV, IPS Elektroniklabor GmbH). The TiO2 nanotube layers, with a thickness of \u223c20\u202f\u03bcm and a nanotube diameter of \u223c110\u202fnm, were prepared by anodization of Ti foils at 60\u202fV (with sweep rate of 1\u202fV/s) for 4\u202fh in an ethylene glycol based electrolyte containing 170\u202fmM NH4F and 1.5\u202fvol.% of deionized H2O. After the anodization, the grown TiO2 nanotube layers were rinsed and sonicated in isopropanol and dried in air. The as-prepared amorphous nanotube layers were further crystallized to the anatase phase by annealing at 400\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh in air atmosphere with a heating rate of 2\u202f\u00b0C/min and natural cooling carried out in a muffle oven. The sulfurization of TiO2 nanotube layers was performed as follows: TiO2 nanotube layers along with 0.2\u202fg of pure sulfur were placed into cleaned quartz ampoules which were subsequently evacuated to 10\u22123\u202fPa and sealed. In the next step, the evacuated ampoules were exposed to temperatures in the range from 250\u202f\u00b0C to 400\u202f\u00b0C (50\u202f\u00b0C step) all for 7\u202fmin, and 450\u202f\u00b0C for 7, 30\u202fmin and 3\u202fh with a heating rate of 5\u202f\u00b0C/min and then naturally cooled to the room temperature inside the furnace. The structure and morphology of the TiO2 nanotube layers were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (Empyrean, Malvern Panalytical) and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM JEOL JSM 7500\u202fF). All photocurrent measurements were carried out in an aqueous electrolyte containing 0.1\u202fM Na2SO4 at a constant potential of 0.4\u202fV vs 3\u202fM Ag/AgCl, employing a photoelectric spectrophotometer (Instytut Fotonowy) connected with the modular electrochemical system AUTOLAB (model \u201cPGSTAT 204\u201d, Metrohm Autolab B.V.) operated with Nova 1.10 software. A three-electrode cell with a flat quartz window was. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "employed with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and the anodized and annealed Ti substrate as working electrode, pressed against an O-ring of the electrochemical cell leading to an irradiated sample area of 0.28\u202fcm2. The wavelength dependence of photocurrent densities was measured using a monochromatic light source provided by a 150\u202fW Xe lamp and a universal grating monochromator, with a bandwidth of 5\u202fnm. The monochromatic light source employed for excitation was controlled using a shutter between light and dark phases with an interval of 10\u202fs. Further to that, the photocurrent density transients were measured at constant wavelengths of 360\u202fnm and 450\u202fnm (these wavelengths were selected based on the maximum photocurrent density, representing the highest photoresponse in the UV and VIS light spectrum, respectively). Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in the potential range from \u22120.4\u202fV to 1\u202fV vs. 3\u202fM Ag/AgCl with a sweep rate of 5\u202fmV/s, starting at 0\u202fV towards positive voltages in the dark. The photocatalytic decomposition of an aqueous methylene blue (MB) solution with an initial concentration of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22125\u202fM was performed in a quartz cuvette with irradiation by a LED-based UV lamp with a power output 10\u202fW and a wavelength of 365\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fnm. Prior to the MB photodecomposition, probed samples with an area of 0.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fcm2 were immersed in a quartz cuvette containing 3.5\u202fml MB for 1\u202fh with constant stirring to achieve a dye adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. The absorbance of the MB solution was periodically measured (10 or 30\u202fmin interval) by a UV\u2013VIS spectrometer (S-200, Boeco) at a wavelength of 670\u202fnm to monitor the decomposition rates.  The optimization process was carried out within two complementary steps. First, the time of sulfur treatment was reduced from 3\u202fh to 7\u202fmin at a constant temperature of 450\u202f\u00b0C. In the second step, the sulfur treatment duration was fixed at 7\u202fmin while the temperature was gradually decreased from 450\u202f\u00b0C to 250\u202f\u00b0C with 50\u202f\u00b0C step. Fig. 1 A shows that the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) across the spectral range from 310 to 550\u202fnm significantly increases with decreasing the sulfurization time from 3\u202fh to 7\u202fmin at a constant temperature of 450\u202f\u00b0C. Further, decreasing the temperature from 450\u202f\u00b0C to 400\u202f\u00b0C results in two changes, namely: \u02dc15% drop in IPCE in the wavelength range from 300 to 340\u202fnm and \u02dc12\u202fnm red-shift in the wavelength range from 350 to 370\u202fnm. However, the IPCE does not change with a subsequent decrease of the temperature to 350\u202f\u00b0C. One can see from Fig. 1B that sulfurization at temperatures lower than 350\u202f\u00b0C leads to a reduction in photoresponse in both UV and VIS spectral regions, which indicates that the sulfurization at 350 and/or 400\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin represents the optimal experimental conditions to obtain the most effective photocurrent generation via sulfur treated TiO2 nanotube layer. In contrast to the blank TiO2 nanotube layer, sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers show superior photoresponse, as shown in Fig. 1. More specifically, the IPCE values were about 3 times higher for optimally sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers (350\u202f\u00b0C and 400\u202f\u00b0C, 7\u202fmin) in the UV spectral region, reaching 60% IPCE at 360\u202fnm shown in Fig. 1A, as compared with the blank counterpart. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the annihilation of surface defects in TiO2 [,], resulting in significant inhibition of the charge carrier recombination. Similar results have been very recently reported on S-TiO2 nanoparticles prepared from DMSO [] as well as on TiO2 nanotube layers sulfurized by a mixture of H2/H2S at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin []. It is fair to stress that a pure H2S treatment under the same conditions demonstrates lower IPCE in contrast to H2/H2S [,]. However, the latter approaches exhibited significantly lower photoresponse in the visible spectral region in comparison with sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers under optimum conditions presented in this work. As a consequence, upon irradiation, the photocurrent response of sulfur treated TiO2 nanotube layers rises abruptly in comparison with the sluggish charge transfer kinetics observed in the blank nanotube layer in Fig. 1(C). The incorporation of S atoms into the TiO2 nanotube layers broadens the photocurrent generation from the UV spectral region to 550\u202fnm, which is in a good agreement with previous studies on S-doped TiO2 nanoparticles []. The extension to the VIS light absorption has been described via DFT as substitutional anionic doping of S within TiO2 host matrix, forming S3p orbitals at the top of the valance band maximum and mixing them with O2p orbitals [], which reduce the band gap. The highest photoresponse in the VIS spectral region was observed for nanotube layers sulfurized for 7\u202fmin in the temperature range of 350\u2013450\u202f\u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 1A and D. In the case of temperatures lower than 350\u202f\u00b0C, the sulfurization process seems to be insufficient, whereas sulfurization at 450\u202f\u00b0C induces additional charge traps. Both aspects will be discussed based on the crystallography and the surface morphology of sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers. Complementary diffuse reflectance spectra were also recorded for the blank and sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers and are shown in Figure S1. These spectra are in good agreement with the IPCE values. To unravel the role of the S-based structure on the photocurrent enhancement, we collected the X-ray diffraction patterns of the blank and sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers. At this point, we only singled out TiO2 nanotube layers for which trends in the IPCE curves showed substantial changes in intensity and the red-shift responses, namely: sulfurized at 250\u202f\u00b0C, 350\u202f\u00b0C (optimized condition), 450\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin and 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh and blank (as the reference sample), respectively. Fig. 2 displays XRD patterns recorded in the range of 2\u0398 from 5 to 20\u00b0, where the dominant characteristic peaks of Ti-S phases can be found. One can see that the blank TiO2 nanotube layer does not feature any peak in the studied range of 2\u0398. Upon sulfurization of TiO2 nanotube layers at 250\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin, a diffraction peak appears at 2\u0398\u202f\u02dc\u202f16.5\u00b0 which corresponds to the TiS2-x or Ti-S-O phase with unidentified composition. When the sulfurization was increased to 350\u202f\u00b0C, a new diffraction peak emerges at 2\u0398\u202f\u02dc\u202f15.4\u00b0 which can be assigned to the TiS2 phase, adopting the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "hexagonal structure with space group P 3\u00af m1 [], while the former TiS2-x phase disappears. Since the sulfurization process is performed under the atmosphere with significant surplus of sulfur, the sulfur treatment at 450\u202f\u00b0C leads to the recrystallization of TiS2 into a new phase TiS3, with its characteristic diffraction peak at 2\u0398\u202f\u02dc\u202f10.3\u00b0, possessing the monoclinic structure with space group P21/m []. Based on the XRD evaluation and in comparison with the IPCE results, one comes to a conclusion that mild sulfurization (350 and 400\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin), creating TiS2 phase within nanotube walls, is the most efficient in terms of the photocurrent generation among all conditions used in this study. Nevertheless, the Bragg diffraction analysis is not the surface sensitive method. To illustrate the surface composition we performed XPS analysis of sulfurized sample at 250, 350\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin (optimum conditions for photocurrent harvesting), 450\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin (the optimum condition for the photocatalytic decomposition of the MB aqueous solution) and 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh (final state) to elucidate the oxidation states of the sulphur upon different sulfurization conditions. One can see from Fig. 3 that upon analysis of the S2p XPS spectra, it was identified a few different sulphur specimens, namely S2\u2212 with the binding energy, EB(2p3/2)\u202f=\u202f160.2\u202feV [,], S2 2\u2212 with the binding energy, EB(2p3/2)\u202f=\u202f161.5\u202feV [,], (Sx)2\u2212 with EB(2p3/2)\u202f=\u202f162\u2013163.8\u202feV assigned to polysulphides with a variable number of sulphur atoms in the chain [], elemental S with EB(2p3/2)\u202f=\u202f163.8\u202feV [], (SO3)2\u2212 unit with EB(2p3/2)\u202f=\u202f166.4\u202feV 166.5 and (SO4)2\u2212 unit with EB(2p3/2)\u202f=\u202f168.6\u202feV []. It is apparent that (Sx)2\u2212 polysulphides gradually transform into S2 2\u2212 and S2\u2212 structural units with increasing temperature at which sulfurization proceeds. Upon sulfurization at 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh exclusively S2 2\u2212 and S2\u2212 ions can be considered as a dominant oxidation states of sulphur species on the surface of the TiO2 nanotube layers. The results manifest that the surface composition is complex rather than uniform demonstrated by XRD. There are at least two aspects which can describe the distinct structural information obtained from XRD and XPS. First, XPS probes only the surface area while XRD the whole volume of all samples. Second, in this work double wall TiO2 nanotube layers [,] were used. The outer shell on nanotubes is formed from a \u201cpure\u201d TiO2 while the inner shell is porous containing some dopants (C, F,..) and thus the inner shell is more defective. It seems, from Fig. S2, that the TiO2 in the inner shell reacts readily with the vapour sulphur in comparison with TiO2 in the outer shell. Further, the morphology of the blank and sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers was characterized by SEM. Fig. 4 left column shows top-view SEM images of a blank TiO2 nanotube layer annealed at 400\u202f\u00b0C and sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers at 350\u202f\u00b0C, 400\u202f\u00b0C, 450\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin, 450\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin and 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh. The corresponding representative cross-sectional SEM images, taken at the bottom part of the nanotube layers, are shown in the right column of Fig. 4. An obvious increase of the wall thicknesses with the increasing sulfurization temperature and time unequivocally confirms the reaction of TiO2 with elemental sulfur in the vapour phase and the growth of new Ti-S or Ti-O-S phases depending on the sulfurization conditions. In order to demonstrate that the TiO2 nanotube layers were homogeneously treated with sulfur throughout the whole thickness of all layers (approx. 20\u202f\u03bcm), cross-sectional SEM analyses of the sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers were carried out. These analyses verified that the nanotubes were indeed properly sulfurized from the top to the bottom part as well as within the interiors and exteriors for all nanotube layers. The surface of the blank TiO2 nanotubes is covered by typical ripples on the tube walls connecting the nanotubes together without any other obvious features in between these ripples. Upon sulfurization at 350\u202f\u00b0C, the number of these ripples was dramatically reduced and the tube wall surface was overlaid with flat crystals well adhered to the original TiO2 nanotubes. With increasing sulfurization temperature, the newly formed crystals gradually became more pronounced. For the temperature of 450\u202f\u00b0C (and with increasing durations), the growing crystals gradually interrupt the original continuous nanotube bodies and form rather large connected crystals. We assume that this phenomenon can be responsible for the dramatic decrease in IPCE, observed in Fig. 1, rather than the change in crystal phase from TiS2 to TiS3, as discussed along the observations in Fig. 2. In general, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as TiS2 presented here, have been successfully employed in many applications []. Among them, the photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes represents a prototypical model application of removing pollutants from various wastewaters []. In this work, we have performed the photocatalytic decomposition of a methylene blue aqueous solution (MB) under UV light irradiation at the wavelength of 365\u202fnm. The results in Fig. 5 manifest that the photocatalytic decomposition of MB accelerates with an increasing degree of sulfurization. In this experimental set, the best conditions of sulfurization were found to be 450\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin, having the photodecomposition rate constant 0.028\u202fmin\u22121 which is about 2.3 times higher, compared to the rate constant of the blank TiO2 nanotube layer (0.012\u202fmin\u22121). While the observed trend is not fully in an agreement with the photocurrent results, the explanation of the phenomenon can be described as follow. When the photocurrent is collected, the photogenerated electrons have to be transported to the positive electrode across the whole thickness of nanotube layer. As aforementioned, sulfurization of TiO2 nanotube layers at 450\u202f\u00b0C produces more 3D crystals rather than flat crystals formed at lower temperatures and thereby generates more electron traps. Also, an increased number of the S-Ti-S triplet layers connected with Van der Waals bonds within the hexagonal phase could significantly suppress the electron transfer in the direction perpendicular to the basal plane []. Both aspects have a detrimental effect on the charge carrier transport. Contrary, the photocatalysis proceeds on the solid/liquid interfaces. The low temperature sulfur treatment helps to annihilate surface states by TiS2 flat crystals, which are well connected to the TiO2 nanotube walls. This. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "might explain the enhancement of photocatalytic decomposition of the MB, when sulfurized at 350 and 400\u202f\u00b0C, in contrast to the blank counterpart, while their photodecomposition rate constants (k\u202f=\u202f\u22120.017\u202fmin\u22121) are similar. It is obvious from SEM images that sulfurization at 450\u202f\u00b0C with increasing time augments the surface roughness of the TiO2 nanotube walls by means of nanotube recrystallization which enlarges the effective surface area. It was described in the literature that in the case of TMDCs, the catalytic active centres are located on the edge sites of individual triplet layer []. We believe that the distinct Ti-S crystallites might increase the number of active centres, which accelerates the photocatalytic decomposition of the MB solution with increasing degree of sulfurization. On the other hand, the SEM top view image of the sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layer at 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh shows a noticeable increase of the nanotube wall thickness resulting in the reduction of tube diameters as well as in a decrease of gaps between nanotubes. These morphological changes markedly reduced the active surface area resulting in a lower photocatalytic activity of the heavily sulfurized nanotube layer. Last but not least, Figure S3 shows the stability of the photocatalytic performance of the sulfurized TiO2 nanotube at 400\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin recorded for 2 different tests with one sample carried out with a 5 day span. Next to the utilization as photocatalysts, the family of TMDCs has also attracted significant attention in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their high intrinsic activity in this reaction [,]. To exploit sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, we recorded numerous CV curves in the range of potentials from \u22120.4 to 1\u202fV vs Ag/AgCl under the dark condition. Results are summarized in Fig. 6 for various sulfur treatments. One can see from Fig. 5A that the current densities at \u22120.4\u202fV vs Ag/AgCl gradually increase with the increasing sulfurization temperature from 250 to 350\u202f\u00b0C. The highest value of \u2212200\u202f\u03bcA/cm2 is obtained for the TiO2 nanotube layer sulfurized at 350\u202f\u00b0C, while the blank counterpart generates only \u2212100\u202f\u03bcA/cm2. Although sulfurization at temperatures higher than 350\u202f\u00b0C does not enhance the current density at \u22120.4\u202fV, the cathodic peak is extended to the more positive potentials, as shown in Fig. 6B. It is noteworthy that the obtained results are comparable with recently published reports on TiS2 nanosheets [] and about an order of magnitude lower with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction processed using TiS2 QDs [] and rather worse than a combination of TiS2 \u2013 Pt []. The Tafel slopes demonstrate the benefit of the sulfurization of TiO2 nanotube layers for H2 evolution (Fig. S4). Compared with blank TiO2 nanotube layers, a gradual decrease of Tafel values can be observed for sample after sulfurization until 350/400\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin, namely from 125\u202fmV/dec to 97\u202fmV/dec. Sulfurization at 450\u202f\u00b0C leads to increase the Tafel values again. While the present results are comparable with TiS2 nanosheets [,] but worse in comparison with standard Pt/C 30\u202fmV/dec [,] or other recently reported advanced materials [,,] they demonstrate a useful strategy for further optimalization of low cost electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution catalysts. On top of that, TiO2 nanotube layers sulfurized at 450\u202f\u00b0C exhibit also the anodic oxidation peak in the potential range of \u22120.4 to 1\u202fV. The intensity of this peak dramatically increases with the sulfurization time (see Fig. 6C). For example, TiO2 nanotube layers exposed to the sulfur atmosphere for 3\u202fh acquire a significant current density of 1.2\u202fmA/cm2 at 1\u202fV which is in strong contrast with a few \u03bcA/cm2 monitored on the blank and other sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers treated at milder conditions than 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh. In combination with XRD analyses, we believe that the observed anodic peak is directly linked to the presence of the TiS3 phase formed on the TiO2 nanotube layers, whereas the TiS2 phase does not succumb to the obvious oxidation process until 1\u202fV vs Ag/AgCl.  In conclusion, we presented a systematic study on sulfur treated 1D anodic TiO2 nanotube layers produced in the evacuated quartz ampoules in the range of temperatures from 250 to 450\u202f\u00b0C with different durations from 7\u202fmin to 3\u202fh. We showed that the highest IPCE and at the same time the maximum red shift in the light absorption was observed for the optimal sulfurization conditions: 350\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fmin. Corresponding XRD patterns revealed that the TiO2 nanotubes consist of the TiS2 phase. In contrast, long-term sulfurization at 450\u202f\u00b0C (herein shown for 3\u202fh) leads to the formation of the TiS3 phase within the TiO2 nanotubes, confirmed by XRD. Next, we demonstrated that the sulfurization modifies the morphology and surface area of TiO2 nanotubes by further recrystallization. Although the crystal formation on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes becomes stronger with increasing temperature, nanotube layers maintain their structural integrity and do not collapse in any case. Further, we presented that the photocatalytic decomposition of MB using a wavelength of 365\u202fnm was gradually enhanced with increasing sulfurization temperature until 450\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin compared to the blank nanotube layers. Nanotube layers sulfurized at 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh operated at similar rates as the blank layers. Finally, we demonstrated the potential application of sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. We showed that the highest current density of \u2212200\u202f\u03bcA/cm2 collected at \u22120.4\u202fV vs Ag/AgCl is obtained for the TiO2 nanotube layer sulfurized at 350\u202f\u00b0C, while the blank counterpart generates only \u2212100\u202f\u03bcA/cm2. The sulfurization at temperatures higher than 350\u202f\u00b0C does not enhance the current density at \u22120.4\u202fV but the cathodic peak is extended to more positive potentials. Finally, the sulfurized TiO2 nanotube layers at 450\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh exhibit also an anodic oxidation peak resulting in a significant current density of 1.2\u202fmA/cm2 at 1\u202fV which is in strong contrast with a few \u03bcA/cm2 generated by the blank TiO2 nanotube layers.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2019.144789.txt", "paper": ["Owing to its superior mechanical and chemical durability, oxide glasses have been widely used in various functional and engineering applications involving optical devices [1], MEMS devices [2], and solar cells [3]. Often, due to its high etching rate and low cost [4], aqueous fluoride-based etching (e.g., HF) has been widely used to etch glass materials for a variety of applications including: (1) glass cleaning [5]; (2) removal of native oxides during Si wafer processing [6]; (3) fabricate gratings and other micro/nano structures on glass surface [7]; and (4) blunting surface cracks to increase the mechanical strength of glass [8]. The HF etching methods have also been used to study the subsurface damage of oxide glasses during manufacturing (grinding and polishing) [9] and optic applications [10]. Therefore, it is of great importance to gain a deep understanding the interactions between HF solutions and glass materials under various conditions. It is well known that the HF solutions is made up of the corrosive hydrogen ion (H+) and the toxic fluoride (F\u2212), where the acid corrodes the glass surface and thus allows the toxic fluoride ion to penetrate the glass [11]. Generally, the etching rate of glass materials strongly depends on the concentration, pH, temperature, and glass compositions [3]. In addition, the etching rate of glass materials also depends on the surface damage. For instance, it was reported that after normal indentation by a diamond tip, the HF etching rate of the damaged region at aluminosilicate glass surface was lower than the undamaged zone, causing the formation of the hillock-like structure with the subsequent HF etching [12,13]. It was proposed that, after the normal indentation tests, the local Si-O-Si structures of the damaged regions become densified, leading to a decrease of HF etching rate compared to the undamaged regions [12,13]. Similar results were also observed for the combination of nanoscratch and HF etching of aluminosilicate glass [14] and (Pyrex) borosilicate glass [15]. Furthermore, it was found that with the HF etching rate seemed to be insensitive to the applied load during the indentation, thus as long as the densified portion remains underneath the glass surface, the height of micro-structure at the glass surface could be controlled via the HF etching depth [16]. These results were also shown to successfully fabrication micro-patterns at aluminosilicate glass surfaces, and this fabrication method could be referred to as \u201cSMIL (Stress Masked Image Lithography) [16]. Note that during the indentation/scratch tests of glass surface, the contact pressure is relative low since only densified region remains underneath the glass surface. It is known that with the increasing applied load upon indentation/scratch tests, various type of glass damages will occur involving cracking (such as radial, lateral, and Hertzian) [17,18]. Moreover, when using a chemical-reactive counter-surface (such as Al2O3, Si3N4, and stainless steel), the wear debris can also occur inside the wear track of glass, which cannot be easily cleaned off [19]. With the HF etching, it is questionable if the previous findings from scratch tests of glass surface under such a low contact pressure pertain to the high contact pressure conditions. Previous investigations showed that after HF etching, the visibility of both surface and subsurface cracking at fused silica was significantly enhanced, which was attributed to the increased width of the cracks by HF etching [20,21]. Nevertheless, the effects of various friction-induced damages on the HF etching rate of glass materials after the scratch/wear tests have not been well-addressed yet. This study focuses on addressing the question of the effects of friction-induced damages on the HF etching rate of borosilicate glass. Firstly, various types of friction-induced surface damages are achieved by controlling the applied load conditions for the stainless steel ball slides on borosilicate glass surface in humid air. The humid air environment was chosen because it was found, from our previous studies [19,22], to be very efficient to prevent substantial material removal along with cracking and debris inside the wear track, compared to that in dry air. Then, using 10\u00a0wt% HF solutions, the HF etching rate of various friction-induced damages at borosilicate glass surface is investigated. The mechanisms of the HF etching of various friction-induced damages at borosilicate glass surface are also discussed. These results show that the HF etching rate of glass can be significantly affected by the friction-induced damages, which may help in gaining a deeper understanding of HF etching of glass materials for various functional and engineering applications.  A borosilicate glass with 15\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm dimension size was purchased from (China building materials academy, Beijing, China). The bulk composition of borosilicate glass substrate was analyzed by\u00a0X\u00a0Ray Fluorescence (XRF, Siemens SRS303), and found to be 52% SiO2, 16% B2O3, 7% Al2O3, 14% Na2O, 6% CaO, 5% ZrO2 in weight. 316 AISI stainless steel balls (316-SS) with 4\u00a0mm diameter (Zhejiang sharp metal steel ball, China) were selected as the counter-surface for tribology studies. Before the friction experiments, both the glass substrate and the ball surface were rinsed in ethanol and pure water for 2\u00a0min by ultrasonic cleaning. Then the samples were rinsed with pure water and dried by high-purity nitrogen gas. Using a universal ball-on-flat reciprocating tribometer (MFT3000, Rtec, San Jose, CA), the friction and wear of borosilicate glass substrates were performed in humid air (50% RH) by rubbing against the steel ball. The length of the wear track was 5\u00a0mm, the sliding speed was 4\u00a0mm/s, the normal load was set as 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\u00a0N, respectively. After tribological tests, the wear tracks of borosilicate glass substrates were identified by an optical microscopy (BX51-P, Olympus, Japan) and a white light interferometer (MFT3000, Rtec, San Jose, CA). In order to ensure the reproducibility of experimental results, the test under each working condition was repeated individually at least 5 times. The HF etching experiments were conducted in 10\u00a0wt% HF solutions at room temperature (Fig. 1 ), and the etching time was set as 10\u00a0s, 30\u00a0s, 1\u00a0min, 2\u00a0min, 3\u00a0min, 4\u00a0min, 5\u00a0min and 6\u00a0min, respectively. The surface morphologies of the etched borosilicate glass were observed by an optical microscopy (BX51-P, Olympus, Japan) and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "a white light interferometer (MFT3000, Rtec, San Jose, CA). In addition, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectrum (EDS) system (EVO18, Zessie, Oberkochen, Germany) was employed to evaluate the evolution of the surface damage and element composition of borosilicate glass.  Fig. 2 a-2c displays the SEM images of friction-induced damages of borosilicate glass after rubbing with a smooth 316-SS ball surface under various load conditions. For an applied load of 1\u00a0N, only mild scratches can be observed inside the wear track of borosilicate glass (Fig. 2a). In contrast, when the applied load increases to 2\u00a0N, the friction-induced damages at borosilicate glass surface shift to substantial Hertzian cracking inside the wear track (Fig. 2b), and it further transforms to wear debris when the applied load increases to 3\u00a0N (Fig. 2c). To understand the details of scratch damage of borosilicate glass after frictional tests, Fig. 2d\u20132f shows the typical cross-section line profile of the wear track at borosilicate glass surface for an applied load of 1\u00a0N, 2\u00a0N, and 3\u00a0N, respectively. It is found that the height of the wear track at borosilicate glass surface is\u00a0~\u22120.23\u00a0\u00b5m, ~\u22120.31\u00a0\u00b5m, and\u00a0~\u22120.36\u00a0\u00b5m under an applied load of 1\u00a0N, 2\u00a0N, and 3\u00a0N, respectively. Clearly, the wear depth increases with the applied load under the giving applied load conditions. Thus, the results in Fig. 1 imply that the friction-induced damages at borosilicate glass surface strongly depend on the applied load, which is consistent with our previous results [23,24]. It should be pointed out that the permanent damage, such as Hertzian cracking and wear debris, cannot be easily cleaned out of the wear track. These unique behaviors allow us to study the effects of friction-induced damages on the HF etching of borosilicate glass by studying each type of friction-induced damages under the given applied load conditions. For simplicity, those friction-induced damage regions of the wear track at borosilicate glass surface under various load conditions are referred as scratch zone, cracking zone, and debris zone, respectively, hereafter. Fig. 3 a\u20133c shows the typical SEM images of the wear track of borosilicate glass after HF etching for 6\u00a0min at room temperature. It is clearly that, after HF etching for 6\u00a0min, the scratch zone can be still identified as mild scratches (Fig. 3a), while for the cracking zone, the cracking inside the wear track become blunter after HF etching (Fig. 3b). For the debris zone, the wear debris still remains inside the wear track after HF etching (Fig. 3c). To characterize the evolution of the cross-section line profile of the wear track, Fig. 3d\u20133f shows the cross-section line profiles of the wear track at borosilicate glass surface after HF etching for the scratch, cracking, and debris zone, respectively. Obviously, before HF etching, all the line profiles of damaged borosilicate glass show a typical depression (groove-like) feature; however, after etching with HF for 6\u00a0min, all the line profiles of borosilicate glass become a protrusion (hillock-like) feature, regardless of the type of friction-induced damages. After HF etching, the final height of the protrusion features is\u00a0~0.43\u00a0\u00b5m, ~3.3\u00a0\u00b5m, and\u00a0~5.2\u00a0\u00b5m for the scratch, cracking, and debris zone, respectively. To reveal the details of the evolution of the wear track by HF etching, Fig. 4 a compares the evolution of wear depth of borosilicate glass as a function of etching time. More details about the evolution of the cross-section line profile of the wear tack at borosilicate glass surface as a function of HF etching time can be found in Fig. S1 in Supporting Information. In the scratch zone, the height of the wear track at borosilicate glass surface decreases from\u00a0~\u22120.23\u00a0\u03bcm to\u00a0~0.13\u00a0\u03bcm after HF etching for 5\u00a0min, then it increases to\u00a0~0.49\u00a0\u03bcm after 6\u00a0min etching. Note that the negative and positive value of the height represents the depression and protrusion features, respectively. For the cracking zone, the height of the wear track at borosilicate glass surface decreases from\u00a0~\u22120.31\u00a0\u03bcm to\u00a0~0.07\u00a0\u03bcm after HF etching for 2\u00a0min, then it increases to\u00a0~2.6\u00a0\u03bcm after etching for 6\u00a0min. While for the debris zone, the height of the wear track at borosilicate glass surface decreases from\u00a0~\u22120.36\u00a0\u03bcm to\u00a0~\u22120.13\u00a0\u03bcm after etching by 0.5\u00a0min, then it increases to\u00a0~5.2\u00a0\u03bcm after etching for 6\u00a0min. The results in Fig. 4a clearly show that the critical time for the transition from depression to protrusion structure is different for the various friction-induced damages at borosilicate glass surface. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4b, the evolution of the wear volume as a function of HF etching time shows the similar results with the results in Fig. 4a. Based on the results of Fig. 4a and 4b, it can be roughly estimated that for the scratch zone, the critical time is\u00a0~5\u00a0min; while for the cracking and debris zones, the critical time is\u00a0~2\u00a0min and\u00a0~1\u00a0min, respectively. It should be noted that the decreasing order in original wear depth of borosilicate glass is: debris zone\u00a0>\u00a0cracking zone\u00a0>\u00a0scratch zone, the decreasing order in critical time for the transition from depression to protrusion structure should be the same trend if the HF etching rate of borosilicate glass would not be changed by the friction-induced damages. However, the experimental data shows that the decreasing order in critical time for the transition from depression to protrusion structure is: debris zone\u00a0<\u00a0cracking zone\u00a0<\u00a0scratch zone. Therefore, these findings clearly imply that the friction-induced damage can significantly affect the HF etching rate of borosilicate glass. In order to quantitatively compare the effect of friction-induced damages on the HF etching rate of borosilicate glass, Fig. 5 compares the measured etching rate of pristine glass surface and the calculated etching rate of friction tested regions at glass surface. The etching rate of pristine glass surface is estimated from the weight loss during HF etching [25]. The etching rate of damaged region is calculated from the curvature change of the wear track (Fig. S2 in Supporting information), more details about this calculation can be found in Supporting Information. It can be seen that the etching rate of pristine glass is\u00a0~1.03\u00a0\u00b5m/min (Fig. 5a), and the average HF etching rate decreases to\u00a0~0.92\u00a0\u00b5m/min, ~0.56\u00a0\u00b5m/min, ~0.1\u00a0\u00b5m/min for the scratch, cracking, and debris zone,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "respectively (Fig. 5b). Clearly, the cracking and debris zone exhibits much lower HF etching rate, compared to the scratch zone at borosilicate glass surface. Previous investigations indicated that in the scratched region of borosilicate glass, the transition from groove-like pattern to hillock-like pattern can be ascribed to the etching rate difference between the undamaged and damaged regions [13,15]. Under the application of normal stress, the densification of silicate glass can take place, resulting in the decreased Si-O-Si bond angle and increased Si-O bond length [26]. This locally chemical structure change will reduce the rate of leaching mobile cations out of glass surface, hindering the diffusion of fluorine species such as HF or HF2\u2212 into the leached layer and the subsequent corrosion rate of glass network matrix [12,13]. Since the densification process of oxide glass can also occur under the application of frictional shear stress [27], the HF etching rate of the scratch zone at borosilicate glass surface would be lower than the undamaged (pristine) glass surfaces. In the case of cracking zone, the scratch-induced densification and cracking can exist in the subsurface layer of borosilicate glass, thus both the two factors can affect the HF etching rate. Previously, it was reported that after etching by HF-based etchant, the cracking at fused silica surface induced by laser would become more open [20]. It was attributed to that the HF can diffuse into cracks and corrodes the Si-O-Si networks nearby [20]. However, in the present study, the borosilicate glass composition is completely different from that of fused silica. More importantly, after HF etching for certain time, some elements from the glass subsurface (such as Al, Ca) can leach out and further react with HF. The overall reaction of these metal oxide in the glass with HF can be expressed as [3,14]: Al2O3\u00a0+\u00a06H+\u00a0+\u00a06F\u2212\u00a0\u2192\u00a02AlF3\u2193\u00a0+\u00a03H2O 2CaO\u00a0+\u00a08H+\u00a0+\u00a02F\u2212\u00a0\u2192\u00a0CaF2\u2193\u00a0+\u00a04H2O In order to test whether these metal oxides in the glass can affect the HF etching rate, Fig. 6 a compares the SEM images of the wear track before and after the HF etching. The cracking inside the wear track become much blunt and open after the HF etching. This suggests the HF can diffuse into the Hertzian cracking and corrode the materials nearby. Furthermore, Fig. 6b and 6c compares the typical EDS spectra and the element weight percent of the pristine glass and cracking zone before and after HF etching. It is found that after HF etching, the relative amount of Na, Ca, and Al in the glass (marked with the red rectangle in Fig. 6a) increases, compared to the pre-etching surface. The etched cracking zone also exhibits a noticeable amount of F. The increase of these elements at the etched cracking zone must be a consequence of the formation of fluorine-based precipitation, as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). This fluorine-based precipitation cannot be cleaned off easily since the EDS measurements are conducted after cleaning procedure. The fluorine-based precipitation was reported to act as a \u201cmask\u201d to lower the HF etching rate [14,28,29]. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe the despite the scratch-induced subsurface densification, the formation of fluorine-based precipitation at the cracking zone can play important roles in reducing the HF etching rate of the cracking zone, compared to the scratch zone and pristine glass surface. Previously, it was found that when stainless steel ball sliding with oxide glass substrates, wear debris from the stainless steel ball can adhere inside the wear track of glass substrates [19]. The wear mechanisms of stainless steel ball when rubbing with oxide glass substrates were mainly contributed from the oxidation wear of steel, which can be expressed as [19]: 4Fe\u00a0+\u00a03O2\u00a0+\u00a06H2O\u00a0\u2192\u00a04Fe(OH)3 In the present study, under higher applied load conditions, the wear debris will adhere to the wear track, and it cannot be cleaned off easily (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the wear debris still adheres inside the wear track after the HF etching for 6\u00a0min (Figs. 3c and 7 a\u2013c). This means the friction-induced wear debris may take part in reducing the HF etching rate of borosilicate glass. To test this, Fig. 7d and e compares the typical EDS spectra and the element weight percent of the pristine glass and debris zone after HF etching for 1\u00a0min and 6\u00a0min. Clearly, after friction tests, the wear debris contains remarkable amount of Fe, compared to the pristine glass (Fig. 7e). The Fe in the wear debris must come from the wear of stainless steel ball. Moreover, after the HF etching for 1\u00a0min and 6\u00a0min, the topography of the wear debris seems intact (Fig. 7a\u2013c), and the relative amount of Fe in the wear debris keeps almost unchanged (Fig. 7e). These results suggest that the Fe-containing wear debris keep intact during the HF etching, which should be very resistant to HF etching. There are two reasons which may be responsible for this. On the one hand, after reciprocating scratches, the wear debris may become very densified and well-adhered inside the wear track, the HF solution can neither diffuse into the wear debris and the glass interfaces, nor disperses the wear debris. On the other hand, the Fe(OH)3 contained in wear debris can react with HF to form insoluble FeF3, which in turn can act as \u201cmask\u201d to lower the local HF etching rate [29,30]. In order to further verify whether the well-packaged Fe-containing wear debris are the main contributor for the resistance to HF etching, Fig. 8 compares the evolution of the optical microscopy images and cross-section line profile of wear track at borosilicate glass surface after rubbing against a silica ball, rather than a 316-SS ball. The applied load is 3.0\u00a0N. It is found that after wear tests, some wear debris exhibits inside the wear track, accompanying with some Hertzian cracking (Fig. 8a). With the HF etching, the Hertzian cracking become more dominate and it seems the wear debris has been dispersed or etched away (Fig. 8b and c). Despite the topography evolution from the depression to protrusion feature upon HF etching (Fig. 8d and e), it is found that the critical time for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the transition from depression to protrusion is\u00a0~2\u00a0min when the counter-surface is silica ball, which is longer than for the case of 316-SS ball (Figs. 8e and 4). This implies that after rubbing against a silica ball, the HF etching of borosilicate glass substrate is very similar to the case of cracking (Fig. 4), although some wear debris exhibits inside the wear track prior to the HF etching (Fig. 8a\u2013c). This may due to the wear debris containing silicate-related species from the wear of counter-surface (silica ball) can react with HF and thus cannot hinder the HF etching, which in turn implies that the well-packaged Fe-containing wear debris from the wear of 316-SS ball are main responsible for the ultralow HF etching rate of the debris zone at borosilicate glass surface (Figs. 3\u20135). Generally, the scratch or material removal of oxide glasses can be achieved by rubbing with an abrasive objects upon a mechanical or mechanochemical process [31,32]. Due to locally structure change induced by the scratch process, the HF etching rate between the scratched and unscratched area becomes different. When the borosilicate glasses are scratched with 316-SS ball under lower load conditions, only mild scratches are formed inside the wear track. Due to the friction-induced subsurface densification of borosilicate glass, the HF etching rate of the scratched region of borosilicate glass becomes smaller than the unscratched region, causing the topography evolution from the depression to protrusion feature upon the HF etching (Fig. 3). When the borosilicate glasses are scratched with 316-SS ball under higher load conditions, the friction-induced damages at borosilicate glass surface transform into substantial Hertzian cracking and debris inside the wear track (Fig. 3). For the cracking zone, not only the subsurface densification, some metal ions from the glass can also react with HF and form fluorine-based precipitation, which hinder the HF etching at the cracking zone (Figs. 3 and 6). In contrast, for the debris zone, the well-packaged Fe-containing wear debris is very resist to HF etching, resulting in an ultralow HF etching rate for the debris zone at borosilicate glass (Figs. 3, 7, and 8). Therefore, the results in the present study reveal that the friction-induced damages can significantly affect the HF etching rate of oxide glass for various functional and engineering applications. Not only mild scratches, the Hertzian cracking and debris at oxide glasses upon the frictional tests also exhibits a much lower HF etching rate than the pristine glass. These findings may help design and optimize the HF etching of oxide glasses for various functional and engineering applications.  In this study, the effects of friction-induced surface damages on HF etching rate of borosilicate glass have been studied. Various friction-induced surface damages of borosilicate glass are achieved by rubbing against a stainless-steel ball under various conditions via a universal ball-on-flat reciprocating tribometer. The experimental results show that using 10\u00a0wt% HF as etching solution, the evolution of surface topography of borosilicate glass is very sensitive to the type of friction-induced surface damages. With increasing the etching time, the surface topography evolves from depression to protrusion feature, and the critical time for the transition is\u00a0~5\u00a0min, ~2 min, and\u00a0~1\u00a0min for the scratch, cracking, and debris zone at borosilicate glass surface, respectively. The decreasing order in the HF etching rate of friction-induced damages at borosilicate glass surface is as follows: pristine glass\u00a0>\u00a0scratch zone\u00a0>\u00a0cracking zone\u00a0>\u00a0debris zone. Further analyses indicate that, compared to the pristine and scratched borosilicate glass, the modifier cations (such as Al3+) of borosilicate glass in the cracking zone may play important roles in reducing its HF etching rate, while the well-packaged Fe-containing wear debris of borosilicate glass can significantly suppress its HF etching rate. These results clearly show that the HF selective etching of oxide glass depends on the friction-induced surface damage mode, which may help in gaining a deeper understanding the HF etching of glass materials for various applications.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2019.143593.txt", "paper": ["Recently, Cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) [1\u20133] has been widely proposed as an alternative to the widely considered hybrid organic-inorganic halide light absorber, i.e. the CH3NH3PbI3. This is as the CH3NH3PbI3 has some thermal/moisture instability problem that can decomposes into the unwanted CH3NH3I and PbI2 compounds [4\u20136]. On the other hand, the all-inorganic compound CsPbI3 has proved itself to be an efficient ambient-air-stable perovskite solar cell with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) currently higher than 17% [7]. However, even CsPbI3 does not decompose to its constituent compounds, i.e. CsI and PbI2, at ambient moisture and thermal conditions, the promising CsPbI3 in perovskite structure (black phase) has been discovered to be structurally unstable and can be transformed to the non-perovskite counterpart (yellow phase) within a few hours [2]. The CsPbI3 in the yellow non-perovskite phase possesses an indirect band gap of 2.82\u202feV [1]. This value is too large for being a practical absorber applicable for the solar cell applications. However, CsPbI3 in black phase has appropriate direct band gap of 1.73\u202feV [3]. Therefore, to stabilize the black phase is important to obtain high PCE and long-term stability in the CsPbI3-based perovskite solar cell. The black CsPbI3 is formed in cubic perovskite structure and typically undergoes perovskite phase's instability because the Cs cation is not large enough to hold PbI6 octahedra. Its Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) of about 0.8 suggests that the CsPbI3 perovskite should be formed in orthorhombic (\u03b3-CsPbI3) phase rather than the cubic (\u03b1-CsPbI3) phase. Consistently, \u03b3-CsPbI3 was found to be more stable than \u03b1-CsPbI3 [8], but it still less stable than the non-perovskite counterpart (\u03b4-CsPbI3) phase. In contrast, CsPbBr3 exhibits good perovskite phase's stability but has a large band gap of 2.3\u202feV [9,10] or about 0.6\u202feV higher than that of the \u03b1-CsPbI3 perovskite. Thus, mixing between I and Br anions to form CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 alloys has been widely investigated to improve the perovskite phase's stability, but some increase in band gap has been evident [11\u201314]. Unlike in general alloy systems usually crystalized in the disordered structures, CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 perovskite alloy synthesized with some appropriate value of x, e.g. x\u202f=\u202f1/3 (or CsPbI2Br) has been found to be stable in the ordered structure [15,16]. This has been described in the informative theoretical studies indicating the occurrence of a specific ordered arrangement of Br and I anions with minimized formation energy [15,16]. Thus, CsPbI2Br perovskite with good structural stability and moderate band gap of 1.9\u202feV has been extensively studied during the past few years [12\u201314,17\u201319]. From theoretical point of view, most of the previous studies investigated perovskite phase's stability by focusing only on the formation energy (or energy of mixing for alloys), which is insufficient to analyze the phase transition between perovskite and non-perovskite structure. To gain insight into the perovskite phase's stability, it is necessary to inspect the phase transition pathway and its associated energy barrier between perovskite and non-perovskite phases. Clear understanding about this phase transition mechanism could be helpful to design a new synthesis route that can stabilize perovskite phase, i.e. either by increasing the perovskite to non-perovskite energy barrier or by decreasing non-perovskite to perovskite energy barrier. In this work, variable-cell nudged-elastic-band (VC-NEB) method, which is an efficient and reliable approach for predicting phase transition, was then used to inspect the structural stability and phase transition. CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 alloys with x\u202f=\u202f0, 1/6, 1/3, and 1 has been considered in searching for the mixing ratio x that provides a good perovskite stability with appropriate band gap for solar cell applications.  To elucidate structural transformation mechanism between perovskite and non-perovskite phase of CsPbI3-based light absorbers, we initially considered perovskite structure in the cubic phase because it is more convenient to track the change in crystal structure during phase transition with respect to a high symmetry cubic phase. Cubic perovskite to orthorhombic non-perovskite phase transitions in CsPbI3-based light absorbers were investigated using the variable-cell nudged-elastic-band (VC-NEB) method as implemented in the USPEX package [20]. VC-NEB is a modified version of the original nudged-elastic-band (NEB) method, which allows the variations of crystal lattice parameters (a, b, c, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) along phase transition pathway. Specifically, instead of treating only the force acting on each atom as in the original NEB, the variation of a, b, c, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 (due to stress) is considered as an additional degree of freedom to construct a minimize energy path on potential energy surface. Thus, the VC-NEB method has been considered as one of the most suitable simulation techniques useful to characterize structural transformation between two different crystal structures. Prior to performing the VC-NEB simulation, it is prerequisite to ensure that the atomic fractional coordinates at the initial and final phases (two endpoint structures in the VC-NEB simulation) are correctly mapped. The correct mapping will provide a minimized total path length (summation of distance between the atoms from two endpoints) and reasonable transition pathway. For this purpose, we developed a simple C++ code to perform a numerical search for minimizing the distance between the atoms of two endpoint structures by taking into account periodic boundary condition and translational invariance of the crystal unit cells. Consequently, in this work, the initial paths required for the stability and convergence of the VC-NEB algorithm can be prepared reasonably. In the details of VC-NEB simulation, the number of images (structures) employed to construct the phase transition pathways is 25. No significant change in the phase transition pathways has been found when using higher number of images. Thus, using 25 images is sufficient to represent the phase transition pathways. The variable spring constant approach with the spring constant of 0.5\u20131.0 was employed [20]. For the study of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 alloys, with x\u202f=\u202f0, 1/6, 1/3, and 1, the stable ordered structures that Br anions occupy apical site in PbI6 octahedra has been employed [16]. In the details of DFT calculation, the calculations were performed under the framework of plane wave method implemented in Quantum-Espresso package [21]. All pseudopotentials used in this work were those derived from the standard solid state pseudopotentials (SSSP) [22,23], which. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "is an efficient set of pseudopotentials optimized between accuracy and transferability. The exchange-correlation approximation was treated under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the parameters from Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) [24]. Nonlocal van der Waals density functional based on the approach represented in Ref. [25] has been included. The energy cutoffs of 60 and 480 Rydberg were found sufficiently large for wavefunctions and charge density expansion, respectively. The k-point grid was set based on the reciprocal-space resolution of 0.05 (2\u03c0\u00c5\u22121).  As the main purpose of this study is to investigate the phase transition mechanism in CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 compounds, which is required for structural property calculations, it is necessary to ensure that the DFT methods used in this work provide the accurate results for the considered crystal structures. Prior to investigating the effects of Br substitution on structural phase transition, the structural property of the pristine CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 should be accurately calculated. The calculated lattice parameters a, b, c of bulk CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 in \u03b1- and \u03b4-phases are reported in Table 1 . To compare our calculated lattice constants with data from experiments, we defined percentage discrepancy by considering experimental lattice constants from Refs. [26\u201328] as the references. Surprisingly, although the \u03b4-CsPbBr3 was found to be more structurally stable than \u03b1-CsPbBr3, experimental lattice constants of \u03b4-CsPbBr3 has not been found. As is seen, the maximum percentage discrepancy is only 0.56% when comparing our calculated \u03b1-CsPbBr3 lattice constants with that of Ref. [28]. Similarly, the maximum discrepancies in the cases of \u03b1-CsPbI3, \u03b4-CsPbI3 are only 0.22% and 0.38%, respectively. This indicates that the predictions of lattice constants by employing the nonlocal van de Waals density functional [25] are reliable and emphasizes the importance of this van de Waals correction to the calculations of structure-related properties, especially for this type of compounds. Then, these obtained equilibrium structures of \u03b1- and \u03b4-phases can be used as the initial and final structures to investigate phase transition pathways. Moreover, it is important to verify the reliability of our employed DFT methods to predict the activation energy (E a) of the investigated transition pathway by making a comparison between our present values and other reported data. To the best of our knowledge, the value of E a of perovskite to non-perovskite phase transition of CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 still hasn't been found to be reported by other groups. In the context of perovskite solar cell, the closest related values of activation energies have been reported for the case of CH3NH3 (MA) molecular rotation in CH3NH3PbI3 structure [29], and orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition of CH3NH3PbI3 [30]. The minimized energy pathway for MA rotation was simulated using VC-NEB based on forces and stress calculated from DFT. The molecule is rotated around C-N axis (on-axis rotation) by 360\u00b0. Our calculation exhibits the rotational activation energy of 42\u202fmeV. From the available experimental data, the rotation of MA molecule was investigated using inelastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements [29]. This experimental technique revealed the rotation activation energy of 48\u202fmeV [29], which agrees well with the value obtained from our calculation (42\u202fmeV). Good consistency between our calculation results and experimental data in this case is attributed to the use of suitable van der Waals correction (perturbative correlation) [31] which has been suggested to provide accurate MA molecule geometry (such as bond lengths and bond angle) compared with the experimental data [32]. For the simulation of orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition of CH3NH3PbI3, the activation energy of phase transition has been calculated to be 185\u202fmeV/f.u. (see Fig. 2(b)) while the experimental value of 243\u202fmeV/f.u. has been presented in Ref. [30]. The E a of this perovskite phase transition was determined experimentally from the slope of ln[\u2212ln(1-wt%)] vs 1/T, where wt% is weight(%) of the new phase crystalized when the temperature (T) is varied across the phase transition temperature [30]. The considerable difference in E a of our calculation result and experimental data is expected to be from a lack of exact-exchange treatment, e.g., B3LYP [33,34] which is usually suggested to be used as well as perturbative correlation in order to improve the value of E a significantly [33]. However, to include exact-exchange treatment is very computational expensive for VC-NEB simulation based on forces and stress calculated from plane-wave-based DFT. It is expected that the nonlocal van de Waals density functional used in this work exhibits a suggestive trend, especially when considering only the difference in E a from different Br concentration of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3. To investigate the phase transition mechanism of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3, we firstly focused on the VC-NEB simulation of perovskite to non-perovskite phase transition in pristine CsPbI3. In general, perovskite and non-perovskite structures can be differentiated from each other by considering their octahedral cages' connectivity (octahedral connectivity). The octahedral connectivity of the perovskite structure is 3D corner sharing (Fig. 1(a)) while 1D edge-sharing octahedral chain (Fig. 1(b)) is for the non-perovskite yellow phase [35]. Since octahedral connectivity has been demonstrated to display an important role in determining phase stabilities and electronic structures of perovskite-related materials [35], to track the change of octahedral connectivity on phase transition pathway is then a useful method to understand the phase transition. From the results shown in Fig. 3, the phase transition is initiated by cubic-symmetry breaking, which leads to a noticeable octahedral distortion and deformation as observed in Fig. 3(b). In general, the octahedral distortion (or octahedral tilting) occurring along the phase transition between different perovskite structures could be qualitatively measured via tilting angle [36]. However, the deformation which causes large deviation in B-X bond length (where B and X are B-site cation and anion, respectively) of BX6 octahedra is not frequently detected. In this work, the PbI6 octahedral cage's deformation can be characterized by detecting unequal Pb I bond lengths. Stronger cubic-symmetry breaking applied on the distorted lattice disconnects some corner sharing of octahedral cages as some Pb I bonds turn to be considerable longer than the other's. This is responsible for the occurrence of some distorted square-based pyramids (Fig. 3 (c)). At the 10th state, associated to the structure in. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Fig. 3(d), the corner sharing in z-direction is completely lost. At the transition state (the 14th state, Fig. 3(e)) the corner sharing in x-direction disappears. From the 14th to the final state, the elongation in z-direction and contraction in x-direction are the causes for the formation of edge-sharing octahedral chain. Because the crystal structures along the transition and the final structure are closely matched to each other, it is not necessary to add another state between them. Consequently, the transformation from 3D corner-sharing to 1D edge-sharing octahedral cage has been clearly illustrated in this work. The results reveal that an important transformation mechanism triggering this phase transition is the deformation of octahedral cage in response to cubic symmetry breaking, which introduces a significantly long Pb I bond length in the PbI6 octahedral cage. Consequently, the 3D corner-sharing structure will lose its octahedral connectivity in the region where the extremely long Pb I bond lengths exists. To strengthen Pb I bond by Br substitution is then a promising approach to remain 3D corner-sharing octahedral connectivity and prevent the formation of edge-sharing octahedral chain. Bromine was known to have stronger ionic property and also reduced unit cell volume compared to that of the I, but with broadened band gap. Thus, the incorporation of small amount of Br substituted for I, which does not excessively broaden the band gap and obstruct the phase transition was investigated in this work. VC-NEB simulations of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 alloys with x\u202f=\u202f0, 1/6, 1/3, and 1 have been performed to investigate the effect of Br on phase transition. The phase transition pathways have been calculated and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 4. As is seen in Fig. 4, the substitution of Br for I enhances the energy barrier from cubic perovskite to non-perovskite transition. Thus, this obstructs the phase transition from \u03b1- to \u03b4-phase as expected. The energy barriers of \u03b1- to \u03b4-phase transition linearly increase with increasing Br concentration, which is expected for typical alloy preparation. For phase transition from \u03b4- to \u03b1-phase, low energy barrier is preferable to allow the transformation from the yellow phase back to the desirable black phase. The result in Fig. 4(b) illustrates an anomalously decrease in energy barrier in the case of CsPbI2Br, with respect to the linear trend. This value of energy barrier is also comparable to that of the pristine CsPbBr3. To describe how Br anion affects phase transition behaviors, we carefully examined the crystal structure evolution along the phase transition pathways for all cases of this investigated CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 alloy, where x\u202f=\u202f0, 1/6, 1/3, and 1. The same mechanism of octahedral connectivity's change as presented in Fig. 3 for all cases has been found. This reveals that Br does not change octahedral connectivity's dynamics during phase transition, indicating that these alloys undergo the same feature of structural evolution from 3D corner-sharing to 1D edge-sharing structure for all cases. Thus, the influence of Br on structural transformation cannot be described using only octahedral connectivity. To gain insight into the anomalous behaviors occurred in this alloy system, especially in the case of CsPbI2Br, we tracked the change of lattice parameters and unit cell volume during the phase transition process, as shown in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5(a), at the first ten states of phase transition, the lattice parameter b is almost constant while c appears to increase with the greater rate than that for the decrease of a. This causes the increase in unit cell volume for the first ten states (see Fig. 5(c)). Although both perovskite and non-perovskite structures in this study are in orthogonal crystal system, it is energetically preferable to be transformed via the intermediate states with monoclinic crystal structure (see Fig. 5(b)). Since CsPbI2Br has the chemical formula closer to that of CsPbI3 than CsPbBr3, we then expect that its intermediate states' lattice parameters and unit cell volume should be close to those of CsPbI3. However, from Fig. 5(a-c), it can be noticed that most of the lattice parameters and unit cell volumes of CsPbI2Br (denoted as IB in the Fig. 5) exhibit the values closer to those from CsPbBr3. In addition, the unit cell volume of CsPbI2Br is out of the range connecting between those from CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3. These are the unusual alloy behaviors observed on the perovskite to non-perovskite phase transition pathway. In other theoretical work focusing on the analysis of this alloy's structural stability, excluding phase transition, an anomalously high structural stability of CsPbI2Br perovskite has been found in the case of ordered structure [15], where Br anions occupy the apical sites of octahedral cages. The composition that x\u202f=\u202f1/3 in CsPb(X1-xYx)3 alloys, where X and Y are halide anions, i.e. Cl, Br, and I, has been proved to be a special composition for perovskite structure that minimizes the formation energy (with negative value) and forms the stable ordered alloy. A Coulomb energy gain model has been proposed to describe why this specific ordered structure is the most stable. Thus, the results from this work suggest that the unusual behaviors of CsPbI2Br are not only observed in the case of the static properties (e.g. equilibrium structure calculations) but also in phase transition properties that helps to stabilize perovskite structure. In addition, to illustrate the considerable improvement of CsPbI2Br phase stability with respect to other CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 compounds, the calculated band gap of \u03b1-CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 perovskite and the enthalpy difference (\u0394H per - \u0394H non, where \u0394H per and \u0394H non are the formation enthalpies of CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 in perovskite and non-perovskite phases, respectively) as a function of Br concentration (x) are presented in Fig. 6(a). At the x\u202f=\u202f0.33333 (or CsPbI2Br), the enthalpy difference is dropped abruptly which indicates a significant enhancement of its perovskite phase stability while a linear increase in band gap, which is a normal trend, is detected from both our calculation and experiment [10,37\u201339] (see Fig. 6(b)). Therefore, CsPbI2Br provides a benefit from the improved phase stability with a slight increase in band gap. Although more accurate band gap correction, i.e., QSGW may. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "be required to improve the accuracy of our band gap calculation, especially for the case of CsPbBr3, it will not change the trend of these befitting behaviors of CsPbI2Br compound.  Using the variable-cell nudged-elastic-band method to investigate phase transition mechanism in CsPbI3-based light absorbing materials, the feature of structural change from perovskite to non-perovskite phase and vice versa has been elucidated. For CsPbI3 in cubic phase, all six Pb I bonds belonging to each octahedral cage display an equal bond length. In phase transition process, in response to cubic symmetry breaking, octahedral cages are first distorted and deformed, which can be noticed by the deviation in Pb I bond length in the PbI6 octahedral cage. When the cubic symmetry breaking becomes stronger, difference in Pb I bond length is considerable large enough to disconnect some 3D corner sharing of cubic perovskite's octahedral cage. The disconnection of 3D corner-sharing octahedral cage has been continuously proceeded until the transition state has been reached. After the transition state, the structural change is mainly for forming 1D edge-sharing octahedral cage (non-perovskite structure). It is interesting that cubic perovskite is transformed to non-perovskite orthorhombic phase via monoclinic intermediate states which has been already found in the case of other perovskite compound [41]. The change in unit cell angles (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) during phase transition process might cause the deviation in Pb I bond length. This suggests that the occurrence of shear stress should be avoided to prevent \u03b1-CsPbI3 to \u03b4-CsPbI3 transformation. The feature of structural evolution has been found to be the same for all where x\u202f=\u202f0, 1/6, 1/3, and 1 in CsPb(I1-xBrx)3 alloy. The substitution of bromine for iodine increases the energy barrier of \u03b1- to \u03b4-phase transition as expected, where the increased Br concentration raises the energy barrier linearly. In addition, it has been found that the transformation from \u03b4 phase to \u03b1 phase is easier to occur by the substitution of Br anion. Surprisingly, the decrease in \u03b4-phase to \u03b1-phase energy barrier against the increasing in Br concentration has been found to significantly deviates from a linear trend, especially in the case of CsPbI2Br, where the energy barrier is anomalously low comparable to that of CsPbBr3. With its moderate and direct band gap of 1.9\u202feV reported widely in the literature, our results suggest that CsPbI2Br is the best composition proposed in this work because it not only prevents the formation of non-perovskite phase but also has high ability to transform non-perovskite back to perovskite structure. The finding from this study's calculation then clarifies why one should consider CsPbI2Br as a potential light absorber for high efficient and long-term stable perovskite solar cell.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

At the moment, electrocatalytic splitting water stands out from traditional processes embarked upon in generating hydrogen, as it plausibly produce highly pure hydrogen, with easy implementation and rare environmental pollution [], However, scarce supplies (Pt-based electrocatalysts) or poor electrochemical activity of some catalysts non-noble metal alternatives, still maintains some unsatisfactory levels for electrocatalytic production of hydrogen. Especially, lacking catalysts with high current density greatly hinder the hydrogen production process from the laboratory to practical industrial applications. In contrast to the basic research at laboratory, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), at high-current do not only requires adjustments unto the local structure and electronic state of the catalysts to achieve extremely high intrinsic activity, but also necessitates attention to high mass transport capacity and mechanical stability [], Moreover, due to the fact that seawater account for 96.5 % of this planet\u2019s water abundance, the scarcity of fresh water resources and the many advantages of electrolyzed water under mild conditions together highlighted the importance of studying neutral HER []. However, it should be noticed that inherent reaction disadvantages of neutral HER, that encompass the diffusion-controlled kinetics, the reactant switching fuzzy catalytic mechanism and electron transfer at liquid\u2013solid\u2013gas interfaces leave a large gap between neutral HER and mature industrial hydrogen production (working at large current density under alkaline/acidic conditions for a long time), which casts a shadow on practical applications [], So, in-depth insight into HER, in order to further design and prepare cost-effective, high-efficient catalysts to serve the hydrogen economy is a top priority for researchers. The structural self-reconstruction on OER catalysts (especially under alkaline conditions) has been widely observed and gradually reached a consensus [,]. In this regard, the HER catalysts have received little attention because of the popular notion that these catalysts will remain stable throughout the catalytic process []. Recently, some HER electrocatalysts give different answers, where the HER catalysts would also self-reconstruct new active layers on the surface of catalysts []. Nonetheless, when compared with the extensive and in-depth research on the self-optimization of OER catalysts, for the sporadic study on HER catalysts, it is hard to build convincing structure\u2013performance relationships in the context of the evolution of catalysts in the full pH range. In addition, it is widely observed during the OER process that the self-reconstruction derived components always show enhanced electrochemical performance than their counterparts via direct chemical synthesis, which can be attributed to the self-optimization process introducing structural defects (including unsaturated coordination, anions, phase transformation, etc.) [,]. So, it seems possible to obtain satisfactory catalytic activity by designing suitable HER precatalysts, and then deriving more efficient catalysts after structural self-optimization engineering. As well known, the carbon nanotubes contain residual iron-based species, which came into place after being used as a catalyst during the carbon nanotube preparation process, by embedding the raw carbon nanotubes during the growth process. Generally, it would be washed with strong acid for subsequent experiments [,,]. However, considering the unique Fe species in the original structure and thus applying them as rivet sites to in-situ construct catalysts, may demonstrate better structural/electrochemical stability than common catalysts (loaded on surface of carbon nanotubes). Herein, we directly use the iron remaining on the rSWCNT as the iron source, and then phosphating it to obtain the excellent HER catalytic film P-rSWCNT. XAFS and other fine characterization techniques confirmed that P-rSWCNT underwent a desirable structural self-optimization process during the HER process, where it self-optimized into O-FePx-SWCNT (acidic), P-Fe2O3-SWCNT (neutral) and P-FeOOH-SWCNT (alkaline) as true catalysts. More importantly, all of them shows remarkable catalytic performance under acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. Especially, an overpotential as low as 300 mV is needed to continuously electrolyze water following one-week of high current density of ca.125 mA/cm2 under neutral conditions without observable attenuation, which brings hope to electrolytic HER from seawater/lake water [].  Considering the strong interaction between the residual iron component and the carbon nanotubes, it is greatly attractive to obtain desirable catalysts with satisfactory performance (especially stability) through direct engineering raw nanotubes. Herein, the raw SWCNT were synthesized based on the previous report [], and then placed a suitable size of crude SWCNT to the center of the quartz tube furnace. As the P source, about 1 g NaH2PO2\u00b7H2O was carefully adjusted to the proper position (about 20 cm from the SWCNT) of furnace\u2019s upstream. Then, following the flushing of quartz tube with Ar/H2 (20 %) for 30 min, to clear the tube, we heat the furnace to 400 \u00b0C at a speed of 5 \u00b0C/min and kept it for 2 h. Finally, taking out the prepared catalysts and stored in N2 atmosphere for subsequent characterization and electrochemical tests when the temperature cools down to room temperature.  Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the obtained catalyst is hexagonal \u03b1-Fe2O3 without P-related species (JCPDS#76-1821, Fig. S1). Subsequently, electron microscopy (Figs. 1 a and S2) were utilized to observe the P-rSWCNT. Clearly, the \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanopatches in-situ sprout on the entire carbon nanotubes. As illustrated in Fig. 1b and c, some P elements from the phosphating process also evenly distributed throughout the catalyst besides O, Fe, and C elements. Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was engaged to explore the chemical environment of the obtained catalysts, and the survey spectrum showed that there are C, O, P and Fe in the P-rSWCNT (Fig. S3a). In the Fe 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. S3b), two noticeable peaks located at 711.6 and 725.6 eV can be ascribed to Fe2O3. In addition, another two peaks detected at 706.9 eV and 719.6 eV can be attributed to Fe-P bonds []. As a powerful tool to directly reflect the local geometries and electronic structures of samples, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra, which was utilized to study the P-rSWCNT. The P-rSWCNT shows an analogous absorption curve with. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the reference sample Fe2O3 (Fig. S4a), suggesting that it shares the similar structure with Fe2O3. Also, the P L-edge XANES spectra demonstrated P-Fe bond again according to the analogous absorption curve with reference sample. (Fig. S4b) []. Even so, there is a characteristic pre-edge structure in P-rSWCNT (Fig. 1d), which is on the basis that Fe atoms possess partially filled 3d bands. Clearly, the Fe K-edge XANES spectrum of P-rSWCNT is similar to commercial Fe2O3, notwithstanding its shifts to low energy direction, due to the P doping effect, and with the view that the structural defects from P doping render a broadened and reduced white line peak [,]. To further obtain precise structural signature, the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were performed (Fig. 1e). the Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra for P-rSWCNT reveals that the peak at about 1.55 \u00c5 is similar to that of Fe2O3 but slightly overlaps with the Fe-P peak, indicating that it is P-doped Fe2O3. In addition, to obtain the quantitative structural parameters around the central atoms, we fitted the corresponding XAFS data (Fig. S5 and Table S1) and found that \u223c3.4 O atoms and \u223c2.1 P atoms have been coordinated with the Fe atoms in P-rSWCNT. Furthermore, wavelet transform (WT) plots (Fig. 1f) demonstrate maximum intensity at ca.5 \u00c5\u22121 of P-rSWCNT is between 3.8 \u00c5\u22121 (Fe O bonds) and 5.8 \u00c5\u22121 (Fe P bonds), respectively. Now, all of the aforementioned analysis suggest that the obtained sample is P-doped iron oxide embedding in the SWCNT films. To probe the electrochemical performance of the obtained P-rSWCNT, we performed electrocatalytic HER measurements in a wide pH range (see details in Supporting Information). Many advantages of HER under neutral conditions have attracted widespread attention due to impressive generation of environment/equipment-friendly compatibility, no acid mist pollution on the generated hydrogen, easy combination with biological processes etc. More importantly, splitting water under neutral conditions elevate the hope of direct electrolysis of ocean, lake or river water, without the need for cost demanding environmental protection membranes or separators, greatly reducing its business costs and meeting sustainability-being recognized as the ultimate goal of the hydrogen production []. Accordingly, the electrocatatlytic HER activity of the P-rSWCNT under neutral conditions is investigated (Fig. 2 a). The P-rSWCNT only needs an overpotential of 146.7 mV to execute 10 mA/cm2, as the catalytic performance of r-SWCNT is almost negligible. Further, the Tafel collected (Fig. 2b). Compared with other reference catalysts, the P-rSWCNT shows a favorable Tafel slope (80 mV/dec), suggesting enhanced reaction kinetics and lower energy consumption in the electrochemical processes []. To obtain a clearer knowledge of the events undertaking the charge transfer kinetics of P-rSWCNT in HER, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was carried out at an overpotential of 200 mV. From the Nyquist plots (Fig. S6a), the P-rSWCNT possess the smaller charge transfer resistance and thus affords it faster HER kinetics under neutral conditions. As a prerequisite for practical industrial applications, stability is a fundamental quality of potential industrial catalysts (especially at high current density). Therefore, we used chronoamperometry (i-t) method to study the stability of the catalyst at a constant potential of 300 mV under neutral conditions (Fig. 2c), and found that P-rSWCNT had no visible attenuation for more than one-week. Such astonishing stability has never been reported to our knowledge (Fig. 2d) [,,]. Furthermore, gas chromatography was employed to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the actual hydrogen evolution rate of the prepared electrode, revealing a nearly 100 % Faradic efficiency and a remarkable H2 evolution rate value of 0.25 \u03bcmol /min at overpotential of 150 mV (Fig. S6b). There is no doubt that the unique three-dimensional freestanding structure will provide more active sites. Therefore, the catalysts\u2019 double-layer capacitance (Cdl) were collected through electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV), from which the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) based on its proportional relationship with the Cdl could be deuced []. Noticeably, although r-SWCNT and P-rSWCNT have a large gap in electrocatalytic performance, they possess the similar ECSA (Fig. S7), implying that the superb catalytic performance of P-rSWCNT mainly originate from its superb intrinsic activity. In line with the aforementioned, it is imperative to quantify the intrinsic catalytic activity of P-rSWCNT, which we did through further calculation of the turnover frequency (TOF). At an overpotential of 200 mV, the TOF value of P-rSWCNT can reach 8.1 H2 s\u22121 overwhelming almost all previously reported catalysts (Fig. S8). Furthermore, we normalized electrochemical dates by the ECSA and obtained the same results (Fig. S9). Now, it is safe to conclude that large surface area, remarkable intrinsic activity and favorable reaction kinetics provide excellent catalytic performance for the obtained P-rSWCNT. Considering the ongoing advancement in the industrial-scale electrolysis technologies, it is self-evident to recognize the significance of excellent acidic/alkaline HER catalysts for the approaching hydrogen economy, typically in proton membrane exchange fuel cells, alkaline electrolyzes and photovoltaic cells []. As shown in Figs. S10\u2013S15, the P-rSWCNT shows satisfactory electrochemical performance under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Typically, direct seawater electrolysis would act as the ultimate solution for electrocatalytic splitting water to produce hydrogen [,]. If possible, more available river, lake and even domestic wastewater may be ideal hydrogen sources for inland areas far from the ocean. The impressive catalytic performance of P-rSWCNT encourages us to attempt outdoor electrolysis of lake water using sunlight (Figs. S16 and S17), which step up the prospect of direct electrocatalytic splitting river/lake water and even wastewater in inland areas. The P-rSWCNT's excellent performance over a wide pH range raises a new question: does the P-rSWCNT derives more efficient electrocatalysts and thus contribute to the remarkable performance in different electrolyte? Curiously, a series of fine characterization methods were employed to identify true active sites to build the structure-performance relationship. At first, we investigated the P-rSWCNT after neutral HER which is named P-rSWCNT-7. The typical XRD pattern indicates that the main phase of P-rSWCNT-7 is Fe2O3 (Fig. S18). SEM and TEM images (Fig.S19) showed a significant structural evolution in P-rSWCNT-7. From the HRTEM image (Fig. S20), there is. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "a set of apparent lattice fringes (0.177 and 0.187 nm) and a crystal plane angle of 76\u00b0, that can be attributed to the (0012) and (123) planes of Fe2O3. Also, the elemental mapping indicates that Fe, C, P and O elements are homogeneously distributed all over the catalyst (Fig. S21). Subsequently, the XPS was utilized to probe the P-rSWCNT-7. In the Fe 2p XPS spectrum, two characteristic peaks at 712.4 and 725.9 eV confirms the Fe3+ states (Fig. S22a). Besides, in the P 2p XPS spectrum, there is a broadened peak located at 134 eV, originating from the oxidized P species on the catalyst surface (Fig. S22b) []. Also, the ratio of P species compared to Fe species elements in the P-rSWCNT-7 catalyst, remain almost unchanged under neutral conditions (Table S2), which is consistent with the above elemental mapping. Furthermore, more informative XANES spectrum was employed to study P-rSWCNT-7 (Fig. 3 a). The Fe L-edge XANES spectra indicates that the P-rSWCNT-7 is mainly composed of Fe2O3, which is in good agreement with the above analyses. Intriguingly, there are P elements doped P-rSWCNT-7 according to the P L-edge XANES, and a characteristic resonance peak around 147 eV confirms the presence of phosphate, which is in consistence with the above XPS results []. In the Fe K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3b) of P-rSWCNT-7 show the same shape as that of commercial Fe2O3, indicating that the main structure of P-rSWCNT-7 is similar to Fe2O3. Subsequently, EXAFS spectra (Fig. 3c) identify the major peak around 1.6 \u00c5 ascribed to Fe-O/P bonds. To further describe the P-rSWCNT-7 quantitatively, we fitted the corresponding FT-XAFS date (Fig. 3d and Table S3) and realized that the Fe-O coordination number increased to \u223c3.6 O atoms. By now, the aforementioned analyses have clarified that P-rSWCNT undergoes a structural self-optimization during neutral HER process. As a matter of fact, whether the HER electrocatalysts undergo self-optimization process in actual work like OER catalysts remains an open question, even under alkaline conditions. Consequently, the detectable self-optimization behavior of P-rSWCNT-7 inspired us to characterize the P-rSWCNT after acidic HER (P-rSWCNT-0) and alkaline HER (P-rSWCNT-14). Following fine characterizations of P-rSWCNT-0 and P-rSWCNT-14 (Figs. S23-S36 and Table S4 and S5), we witnessed that the P-rSWCNT self-optimized into trace O doped FePx supported on SWCNT (O-FePx-SWCNT) under acidic electrolyte, while transformed into P-FeOOH-SWCNT under alkaline electrolyte. Considering that we have now obtained more efficient catalysts via the structural self-optimization engineering, it is necessary to study the HER mechanism of these catalysts to facilitate targeted designing of the pre-catalyst in the future, and thus the density functional theory calculations were executed. Here, taking P-rSWCNT-7 as an example. Two different surfaces were being considered: pristine \u03b1-Fe2O3 (110) surface (Fig. S37a); and P atom-deposited \u03b1-Fe2O3 (110) surface (Fig. S37b). It is generally accepted that water splitting of the Volmer step worked at the first step of HER in neutral media []. Thus, the \u0394G(*OH + *H) can be employed to investigate the neutral HER electrochemical performance thermodynamically. As shown in Figs. 4 a and S38, \u0394G(*OH + *H) for Fe2O3 is as high as 2.67 eV when hydroxyl group (*OH) and hydrogen (*H) are both adsorbed onto the Fe atom sites. However, \u0394G(*OH + *H) for the same adsorption sites decreased to 1.76 eV after one P atom is involved in the surface. Furthermore, \u0394G(*OH + *H) decreased to 0.38 eV when *H occupies the P adsorption site. Such a significant decrease in \u0394G(*OH + *H) indicates that the P atom could regulated the catalyst to facilitate the Volmer step and following HER processes under neutral media. In addition, the \u0394G(*H) is another important descriptor to evaluate electrocatalytic HER activity. Generally, highly efficient catalysts should possess |\u0394G(*H)| close to zero []. The computational results for different catalysts and sites are shown in Figs. 4a and S39. Also, a similar phenomenon appears when one P atom is involved. Fe2O3 has an endergonic \u0394G(H*) of 1.48 eV with the adsorption site of Fe atom, implying an energetically unfavourable interaction with hydrogen. A decrease in \u0394G(H*) also appears at the Fe adsorption site as one P atom is involved. More so, there was a further decrease to -0.12 eV in \u0394G(H*) of P-Fe2O3 when the P atom acts as the adsorption site. Furthermore, the Bader charge analysis (Fig. 4b) revealed 1.784 e\u2212 transferred from the P atom to the Fe2O3 fragment. Specifically, the electron mainly transfers from the P atom to its adjacent atoms in the Fe2O3 fragment. For example, the charge population of the two Fe atoms closest to the P atom increases by 0.262 e\u2212 and 0.287 e\u2212 respectively. These computational results (Table S6) demonstrates that the P atom could tune the catalysts\u2019 electronic structure and act as an active site (Figs. 4c and S40). To gain more insight, and experimentally verify the catalytic mechanism revealed by theoretical calculations, the operando synchrotron FT-IR was employed. As shown in Fig. S41, there is no obvious absorption peak that appeared around 2300 cm\u22121 at the potential of \u22120.1 V. Subsequently, when the potential dropped to \u22120.2 V, the absorption peak due to the stretching vibration of P-Hads began to appear [,], and became stronger as the potential continues to shift negatively, indicating that P adsorbed onto H atoms (from the Volmer step) and formed the P-Hads as key intermediate state of the HER. This observation strongly confirms the theoretical calculations proposed catalytic mechanism that P atoms can contribute to the initial water splitting process, and then participate in the subsequent H adsorption process as an active site, and thus giving it ultra-high electrical performance under neutral conditions.  Here, led by the concept of green chemistry, we initially used the residual Fe impurities in the raw SWCNT as the Fe source to directly prepare P-rSWCNT, from where we obtained O-FePx-SWCNT (acidic), P-Fe2O3-SWCNT (neutral) and P-FeOOH-SWCNT (basic) as true catalysts after a structural self-optimization process. More importantly, these catalysts derived from the self-optimization process exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance. Especially, it reached 10 mA/cm2 only. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "at 146.7 mV under neutral conditions, and maintained working at such a high current density of approximately 125 mA/cm2 more than one week without visible attenuation. Furthermore, electrolysis of lake water with commercial solar cell integrated devices exhibited attractive practical applications. Finally, theoretical calculations together with in-situ/ex-situ synchrotron radiation-based spectrum indicate that heterogeneous P atoms could accelerate the initial water splitting process, and then directly participate in the H adsorption process as active sites. From these findings, our work has developed a new way to obtain high-efficiency catalysts through structural self-optimization process and provided promising HER catalytic films, which raise hope for the seawater, lake water and even wastewater electrolysis to produce hydrogen. Moreover, we answer the long-standing controversy about the active sites of HER catalysts based on operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations as well as draw researchers\u2019 attention to the structural self-optimization on HER catalysts, which may accelerate HER relevant studies to serve the hydrogen economy as soon as possible.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Among various kinds of solar cells, ternary compound copper indium selenide CuInSe2 rapidly emerges as one of promising candidates in thin film solar cells . CuInSe2 has many advantages in solar application: Firstly, its direct band gap energy of 1.04 eV ranges over solar spectrum; and the optical absorption coefficient is as high as 105 cm\u22121 for the bulk and 104 cm\u22121 for thin films . Therefore the thickness of absorption layer can be reduced to micron-scale while keeping their optical absorption constant; Secondly, the band gap can be adjusted from 1.04 eV to 1.67 eV by doping gallium to form Cu(In1\u2212xGax)Se layers, which has demonstrated beyond 20% energy conversion efficiency . This efficiency is obviously higher than that of CdTe and \u03b1-silicon thin films based cells . Furthermore, it is said that the sodium (Na) from glass substrates has a positive effect in the growth of CuInSe2 layer , though the mechanism is not clear . One of the limitations in the enhancement of energy conversion efficiency of thin-film solar-cell is the large optical losses due to reflection, shading by grid patterns, and so forth, in particular for the former. Because of the difference of the effective refractive index (RI) between chalcopyrite CuInSe2 and air, the incident light will be reflected in the interface as a consequence of Snell's law. One effective method to reduce reflection and enhance absorption is making flat film into textured surface film, the RI of which depends on the surface structure and the density of the nanopatterns. The nanopatterned arrays at the interface provide an intermediate refractive index step for the graded transition of RI from 1 to 4.7 . This gradual reduction of RI will lead to reflection suppression in the interface. Many results have demonstrated that optical absorption of patterned films is larger than flat films and their reflection is reduced in the meantime. However, most of the reports about nanostructures are about silicon-based solar materials. Furthermore, researches on nanocone arrays with hollow are rare, let alone in combination with CuInSe2 films. In this paper, CuInSe2 films with patterned surface were constructed and the relation between surface shape of films and optical properties are demonstrated. In our researches, the films were deposited by electron beam evaporation. Solid elemental selenium powder was chosen as the source of senlenization instead of the toxic gas H2Se in traditional selenization process. Polystyrene (PS) nanospheres lithography technique had been used to fabricate nanocone arrays of CuInSe2 thin films. This technique is an efficient and inexpensive method for fabrication of periodic nanostructures with feature size in the sub-micron region . Periodic nanocone films with suppressed reflection have been obtained.  Fabrication of CuInSe2 thin films: The films were deposited by electron beam evaporation with CuInSe2 source powder that had been evaporated several times. An electron gun of 6 kV was used to evaporate the source powder in graphite boat under 10\u22124 pa pressure. The substrates used were microscope glass slides. The substrates were heated in acid solution and alkalescence solution for 10 min in turn and then cleaned by distilled water. The thickness of as-grown film was decided upon transmission spectrum over UV\u2013VIS range. The as-grown films were put onto quartz boat with elemental selenium powder for selenization. Both selenization and annealing process took place under 10\u22122 pa pressure. The post-deposition selenization was carried out at 250 \u00b0C for 30 min. Then the films were annealed at 400 \u00b0C for 40 min and cooled to room temperature naturally. The patterned samples were annealed under nitrogen atmosphere at 400 \u00b0C for 40 min and cooled to room temperature naturally. The fabrication of patterned substrate were using direct nanosphere lithograph described in details in our previous work . In briefly, after the glass substrates were coated with a monolayer of PS nanospheres, reactive-ion- etching (RIE) process was carried in CF4 plasma. Due to different etching ratio between PS spheres and glass substrates, patterned substrates with different size and morphology were obtained by changing etching power. Then CuInSe2 films were deposited onto patterned substrates by above fabrication process. The composition of above films was obtained by analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), acquired on an ARL X\u2019TRA diffractometer (Switzerland) with the radiation source of Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.54 \u00c5). The film morphologies were characterized by atom force microscope (AFM, Veeco Multimode NanoScope 3D). UV\u2013VIS\u2013NIR absorbance and transmission spectra were recorded using Shimadzu UV-3600 UV\u2013VIS\u2013NIR spectrophotometer at a normal angle of incidence.  Fig. 1 shows XRD data of as-grown film and annealed films. As seen from Fig. 1a, Cu\u2013In\u2013Se compound is amorphous without post-heating treatment. Thin films crystals forming at the 400 \u00b0C given in Fig. 1b. The diffraction peaks observed at the angle 2\u03b8 26.6\u00b0, 27.6\u00b0, 30.5\u00b0, 44.7\u00b0 and 52.4\u00b0 can be indexed to the (1 1 2), (1 0 3), (2 2 0), (3 0 1) and (1 1 6)/(3 1 2) of tetragonal chalcopyrite CuInSe2 (\u03b1-CIS) phase. And other peaks at 25.0\u00b0, 25.3\u00b0, 37.5\u00b0, 44.0\u00b0 and 52.7\u00b0 can be indexed to the (1 1 0), (1 1 1), (1 1 6), (3 0 0) and (3 0 6) of hexagonal In2Se3 (\u03b3-IS) phase, respectively. All the peaks in Fig. 1b are quite weak, which means that 400 \u00b0C-selenized film is poorly crystallized and there existed amorphous Cu in the film. Therefore the 400 \u00b0C-selenized sample consists of \u03b1-CuInSe2 and secondary phase of \u03b3-In2Se3. The \u03b1-CuInSe2 selenized at 500 \u00b0C is clearly identified by the peaks (1 1 2) at 26.6\u00b0, (1 0 3) at 27.6\u00b0, (2 0 0) at 30.5\u00b0, (2 1 1) at 35.5\u00b0, (2 0 4)/(2 2 0) at 44.3\u00b0 and (1 1 6)/(3 1 2) at 52.4\u00b0 given in Fig. 1c. We can conclude that as-grown films selenized at 500 \u00b0C have been selenzed entirely and become chalcopyrite phase of CuInSe2 preferred (1 1 2) orientation. The peaks. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "are narrow and intense, indicating that the film selenized at 500 \u00b0C is well crystallized. UV\u2013VIS\u2013NIR absorbance and transmission spectra given in Fig. 2 are recorded for films selenized at 500 \u00b0C. The absorption spectrum shows that 90% incident photons with their energy hv > E g are absorbed by CuInSe2 film, which shows a strong visible light absorption property. The transmission data can be converted into (\u03b1hv)2 versus hv plot. The light absorption coefficient \u03b1 and band gap E g for direct band semiconductor are calculated using following formulae: \u03b1=1/dlnT/(1\u2212R)2and(\u03b1hv)2=A(hv\u2212Eg) where d is the film thickness (450 nm) and A is a constant related to the effective masses . The inset in Fig. 2 shows the plot of (\u03b1hv)2 against hv. Extrapolating the straight line portion to energy axis for zero absorption gives an energy intercept of 1.03eV \u00b1 0.01 eV, in agreement with the E g of CuInSe2 , which confirms XRD. AFM images for substrate and patterned films during fabrication procedures are presented in Fig. 3 . The morphologies of PS nanospheres self-assembled on substrates are shown in Fig. 3a. These PS nanospheres have a uniform size of 220 nm and are closed-packed. After RIE, AFM image of the substrate surface is presented in Fig. 3b. The distance between adjacent nanocones enlarges. Fig. 3c and d displays the surface morphologies of as-grown CuInSe2 film and film annealed in nitrogen atmosphere. From these figures, it is clearly seen that the surface is patterned with uniform nanocone arrays. The as-deposited film on patterned nanocone substrate share strong similarity with etched substrates and the period of the nanocone arrays is about 220 nm which is identical to the diameter of PS spheres. However, on the average the heights of nanocones are different, which are 12 nm for etched substrate, 11 nm for as-grown film and 8 nm for annealed film, respectively. After annealing, a decrease of the degree of periodicity is observed. Therefore, annealing process has a little negative impact on the shape maintenance of the nanopatterns. Due to the regularity of nano-patterns on as-grown films, we have paid more attention on the anti-reflection effect of as-grown films. When change the RF power during RIE process, glass substrates with different surfaces morphologies were obtained, which are shown by following AFM images in Fig. 4 . Etching gas is CF4 with flow rate of 30 sccm, etching time is 10 min and etching power are 20 W (Fig. 4a), 40 W (Fig. 4b), 50 W (Fig. 4c), respectively. In Fig. 4a, the film is patterned with nanocones, which are smooth and sharp. However, when etching power increases to 40 W, shallow hollows appear on the tip of the nanocones, which is shown in Fig. 4b. This is because the involatile by-products from the reaction of impurities in glass substrates with CF4 cannot pump out of the chamber in RIE process. The by-products located on the shoulders of the nanocones around PS spheres on the surface, work as new particle template and prevent further etching and the middle hollows form, which is illustrated in Fig. 5 . These nanocones with hollows become compact. The hollow depth is about 6 nm. When etching power reaches 50 W, in Fig. 4c the hollows on the tip of nanocones become deeper and enlarged. The hollow depth increases to 9 nm. When etching power increases from 20 W to 50 W, the height of the periodic arrays hold fairly constant and is about 20 nm, but diversiform morphological characters are obtained. This diversification leads to fantastic optical properties. Anti-reflection effects of patterned films are verified with diffuse reflection spectra. From the results in Fig. 3 we can speculate that the film deposited on substrates shown in Fig. 4 have similar nanopatterns with their substrates. Diffuse reflection of as-grow films on substrates as Fig. 4 has measured, which is given in Fig. 6a. As is seen from the chart, compared with flat sample, there is less reflection of 20 W-etched sample. When etching power increases to 40 W, the sample has much less reflection. And the reflection reaches a minimum value when etching power is 50 W. The peaks and troughs in the reflection spectra result from interference of the films. These obvious reflection suppressions happen over a broad wavelengths range of 200\u20132500 nm involving visible light and infrared light and the suppression value varies with incident wavelength. More attention has been paid to the reflections over visible light due to its application in solar cell with great potential. The decrement ratio at wavelength of 380 nm and 830 nm against etching power is given in Fig. 6b. At the wavelength around 380 nm, diffuse reflection is about 31% for flat film and changes into 21% for patterned film etched under 50 W, the decrement goes up by 33%. And compared with 45% diffuse reflection at 830 nm for flat film, diffuse reflection is about 35% and reduces about 22% for patterned film etched under 50 W. It is found that anti-reflection effects have been improved significantly with increasing etching power. The broadband anti-reflection of nano-patterned CIS films can be understood by considering the effective RI change of the interfaces between air and CIS films. According to effective medium approximation (EMA) , the \u201ceffective medium\u201d is assumed to be a set of two constituent layers. The effective RI of the mixture (n) will be given by f1(n12\u2212n2)(n12+2n2)+f2(n22\u2212n2)(n22+2n2)=0, where n 1 and n 2 are the refractive index of two layers, f 1 and f 2 (f 1 + f 2 = 1) are the corresponding volume fractions. For these nano-arrays, n 1 and n 2 are the refractive index of CIS film and air, f 1 and f 2 are the volume fractions of CIS film and air, respectively. The n depends on volume fractions. The reflection obeys Snell's Law. For flat film, the effective RI changes immediately from 4.7 to 1 across the interface, yielding large diffuse reflection. For film etched under 20 W, these nanocone. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "arrays provide a graded step of the effective RI , causing the diffuse reflection to be reduced to a certain extent. Interestingly for 40 W etched film, the emergence of the hollow feature on the top of nanocones provides another effective RI step besides that nanocone patterns provides. This proves that the structure of periodic nanopattern with hollows have a positive impact upon anti-reflection property of incident beam. And that the best antireflective properties of 50 W etched films results from the best gradual change of effective RI, which arises out of the increasing depth of the hollow. It is found that the deep hollow integrated with nanocone structure show best reflection suppression over a large range of wavelengths. This nanocone arrays with hollow structure can be applied to solar cells as absorption layer to enhance photon absorption.  Chalcopyrite CuInSe2 films with a preferred orientation in the (1 1 2) direction have been synthesized by electron beam evaporation and selenization with solid selenium source. Through template method of self-assembled PS nanospheres, we fabricate nanopatterned films with new shapes, such as nanocones and hollows. In contrast with flat films, these nanopatterned films have less reflection over ultraviolet\u2013visible light. At 830 nm the reflection decrement is the largest of all and reaches 33%. Furthermore, the anti-reflection effect is significantly improved by the hollow morphologies. When the depth of hollow becomes deeper, the effect of reflection suppression improves significantly. These anti-reflection results have a promising application in photovoltaics. In our further research, the hollow patterned films will be applied to solar cell to improve energy conversion efficiency.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

This extensive use of pesticides results in continuous accumulation of their residues in the environment and is indeed a risk as most of them are toxic and cause hazardous effects to living beings [2,3]. Carbendazim (methyl-2-benzimidazole carbamate) is a common wide-spectrum benzimidazole fungicide applied to various varieties of crops such as vegetables, cereals, fruits, and fodder beet for the control of a wide range of pathogens [4]. This systemic fungicide is used for both pre-harvest and post-harvest treatment of crops, and hence it is pivotal to evaluate consumers\u2019 exposure to carbendazim through foods. Various studies have revealed the hazardous effects of carbendazim in animals, human beings, and soil microorganisms [5-7]. The common critical problem caused by this fungicide is testicular toxicity in living beings [8]. Apart from its presence in the environment through its frequent usage in the agricultural sector, it is also formed by the rapid degradation of other commonly used pesticides, such as thiphanate-methyl and benomyl. The benzimidazolic ring of carbendazim is tough to break, so its degradation is extremely slow. This is a significant concern regarding environmental safety as this toxic fungicide persists in the environment for a long time. Moreover, carbendazim decays slowly in water because of its low solubility (8\u00a0mg/L at 25\u00a0\u00b0C), resulting in its substantial presence in the aquatic environment [9]. Therefore, the sensitive and rapid determination of carbendazim and its degradation is highly important to environmental safety and public health protection. Among the various analytical approaches, such as high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopy, ratiometric fluorescence assay, UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry, and Raman scattering used in quantification of carbendazim, electrochemical methods hold several advantages including high sensitivity, low cost, feasibility of miniaturization, and simplicity [10-14]. Hence, we carried out ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of toxic carbendazim based on a novel nanocomposite. Scheme 1 shows schematic demonstration of carbendazim determination in this work. Hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) nanoparticles have attained significant attention in various fields due to their intriguing properties along with low cost, earth abundance, and non-toxicity. This promising n-type transition metal oxide possesses a narrow band gap 2.1\u00a0eV and is employed in applications such as rechargeable batteries, solar cells, gas sensors, smart windows devices, etc. [15-17]. Considerable efforts were made by researchers in the synthesis of various morphologies of \u03b1-Fe2O3 based on different methods including sol\u2013gel, solvothermal, co-precipitation, microwave irradiation, and hydrothermal [18,19]. Some of the fascinating properties of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles worth mentioning are their large surface area, high theoretical capacity, long-term stability, large potential window, superparamagnetism, high optical absorption coefficient, and excellent surface-to-volume ratio. Apart from these properties, related investigations revealed the excellent conductivity and catalytic properties of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and thus \u03b1-Fe2O3 can be considered as an apt material for electrochemical studies [20,21]. However, agglomeration due to inherent high surface energy is a significant hindrance to the effective utilization of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles in various applications [22]. A fruitful approach to prevent agglomeration of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles is supporting them with carbonaceous materials. Combining \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with a carbonaceous material can also enhance the electrical conductivity and improve the electrochemical properties due to synergistic effects. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are considered as a promising carbon nanomaterial with cylindrical nanostructures having graphene layers arranged in different forms. It is the stacking manner of its graphene sheets that determines these various forms. CNFs with unique 1-dimensional structure have certain significant advantages over other carbon nanomaterials due to their various distinctive properties. For instance, CNFs are inexpensive, have larger ratio of surface active groups-to-volume, and exhibit better wettability and dispersion compared to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [23]. Moreover, the outer wall of CNFs has more edge sites and less order, resulting in enhanced electron transfer of electroactive analytes to the surface. It is to be noted that the properties of CNFs are impacted by the orientation of its graphene layers. Spinning and chemical vapor deposition are the common techniques adopted for the synthesis of CNFs with significant properties [24]. Therefore, CNFs were used in various applications [25]. Even though CNFs exhibit significant properties, chemical inertness and weak dispersion persist as a major hindrance toward their effective utilization in many applications. Surface functionalization is a facile technique that can be adopted to eliminate these limitations, and it is noted that CNFs exhibit flexibility in surface functionalization. Here, we functionalized CNFs surface with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), a cyclic oligosaccharide. This environment-friendly and water-soluble natural polymer has a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior and thus enhances the stability and adsorption capacity of \u03b2-CD-modified CNFs [26,27]. A novel \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite was synthesized for ultrasensitive determination and degradation of the hazardous fungicide carbendazim in this work. Even though Fe2O3 is earth abundant and inexpensive, as per our best knowledge, no previous works were reported on carbendazim detection based on Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The synthetic approaches employed for the preparation of \u03b1-Fe2O3, \u03b2-CD-CNFs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite were detailed, and important characterizations of the as-synthesized materials were performed in this work. The outcomes of various electrochemical investigations conducted for the detection of carbendazim were also analyzed. Moreover, the efficiency of the carbendazim sensor was further assessed by examining its stability, repeatability, anti-interference performance and real sample analysis.  The chemicals used in this work including ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3\u00b76H2O), \u03b2-CD (C42H70O35), CNF, disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4), monosodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), carbendazim (C9H9N3O2), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. We used Bruker D8 powder diffractometer for obtaining XRD patterns of materials. Hitachi S4800 and JEOL JSM7600F was used for performing surface topography analysis. The Raman and FTIR spectra were captured using Acron confocal Raman mapping system and PerkinElmer spotlight 200i microspectrometer, respectively. All electrochemical experiments were carried out using Metrohm Autolab instrument. In this work, \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were prepared based on a green aqueous solution method. Firstly, FeCl3\u00b76H2O was dissolved in 250\u00a0mL DI water to make a 0.1 M solution. Then, the above solution was kept in a water bath and heated to 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 16\u00a0h. A dark reddish colored. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "dispersion was obtained after allowing the resultant solution to cool down to room temperature. This product was then centrifuged, washed several times with ethanol to remove the excess chlorine ion impurities followed by drying and calcination (400\u00a0\u00b0C, 2\u00a0h) to acquire \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Surface functionalization of CNFs is a promising technique in the preparation of hybrid nanomaterials, and it also helps the dispersion of CNFs in solvents by disrupting Van der Waals interaction among tubes. Hence, in this work we prepared \u03b2-CD-functionalized CNFs using a hydrothermal method. As a part of the preparation, 15\u00a0mg of CNFs were mixed with 50\u00a0mL of water and ultrasonicated for 30\u00a0min in order to achieve homogeneous dispersion of CNFs. Then, after adding 30\u00a0mg \u03b2-CD cautiously, the CNF suspension was ultrasonicated for another 30\u00a0min, followed by magnetical stirring. Subsequently, it was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 16\u00a0h. Finally, the resultant product was centrifuged and washed with distilled water, followed by drying for acquiring \u03b2-CD-CNFs. We prepared \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs using a sonochemical method. Firstly, 30\u00a0mg of \u03b1-Fe2O3 in 5\u00a0mL solution was ultrasonicated for 60\u00a0min. Then, 10\u00a0mg \u03b2-CD-CNFs was added to the \u03b1-Fe2O3suspension, and ultrasonication was conducted for another 3\u00a0h. The product was subsequently centrifuged and dried at 70\u00a0\u00b0C overnight to attain \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite. Afterwards, we proceeded with the fabrication of nanocomposite-modified screen printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). We dispersed 5\u00a0mg of the prepared nanocomposite in 5\u00a0mL of double distilled (DD) water via 30 min ultrasonication. After the effective dispersion of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs, 8\u00a0\u03bcL of this suspension was carefully drop casted on a SPCE. Then, the modified SPCE was dried at room temperature. The properly dried modified electrode was then utilized in various studies. Scheme 2 depicts the preparation of the nanocomposite and the fabrication of modified SPCE for carbendazim detection.  We performed significant characterizations to analyze morphological, structural, and electrochemical properties of \u03b1-Fe2O3, CNFs, and the \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite. SEM, elemental mapping, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, and EIS techniques were utilized to perform these analyses. We have taken SEM of \u03b1-Fe2O3, CNFs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite in order to analyze their surface topography and composition. The microscopy images obtained from SEM analysis are shown in Fig. 1 . When we analyze the morphology of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as depicted in Fig. 1A, an olive-shaped structure can be observed. We determined the size of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles by measuring the length and breadth, which were around 500\u00a0nm and 300\u00a0nm, respectively. Furthermore, the morphology of CNFs was also captured, and the resultant image is shown in Fig. 1B. A long tube-like structure of CNFs can be clearly noticed in this image. We determined the mean tube diameter of CNFs and found it to be around 100\u00a0nm. Fig. 1C shows the morphology of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite prepared by embellishment of olive-shaped \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles on \u03b2-CD-CNFs. When we examine this SEM image, we can notice the presence of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and \u03b2-CD-CNFs in the nanocomposite. Furthermore, elemental mapping and EDS of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite were recorded to validate the existence of relevant elements in the nanocomposite. Fig. 1E\u2013G depict the elemental mapping of carbon, oxygen, iron, respectively, corresponding to the SEM image shown in Fig. 1D. Moreover, the corresponding EDS spectra of nanocomposite we acquired is given in Fig. 1H. We analyzed crystallography of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, CNFs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite using XRD in this work. The unit cell dimension information of the aforementioned materials was acquired by taking XRD. The XRD patterns of synthesized \u03b1-Fe2O3 is shown in Fig. 2 A. The various diffraction planes including (0 1 2), (1 0 4), (1 1 0), (1 1 3), (0 2 4), (1 1 6), (1 2 2), (0 1 8), (2 1 4), (3 0 0), (1010), (2 2 0), and (3 0 5) corresponds to the respective well-defined peaks in XRD pattern of \u03b1-Fe2O3 at 24.12\u00b0, 33.12\u00b0, 35.60\u00b0, 40.74\u00b0, 49.48\u00b0, 54.03\u00b0, 57.50\u00b0, 57.50\u00b0, 62.46\u00b0, 64.04\u00b0, 71.98\u00b0, 75.54\u00b0, and 77.83\u00b0, which are in agreement with its rhombohedral phase [28]. The XRD of CNFs in Fig. 2B displays peaks at 25.88\u00b0, 43.62\u00b0, and 51.06\u00b0, representing (0 0 2), (1 0 0) and (0 0 4), respectively [29]. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs in Fig. 2B, displays peaks of \u03b1-Fe2O3 and CNFs, validating its unerring formation. The vibrational modes in \u03b1-Fe2O3, CNFs, \u03b2-CD-CNFs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs were analyzed. The resultant Raman spectra obtained for the aforementioned materials are displayed in Fig. 3 A. Analyzing Raman spectrum of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, various well-defined peaks at 234, 255, 302, 418, 507, 617, 820, and 1324\u00a0cm\u22121 can be observed. The peaks at 234 and 507\u00a0cm\u22121 were attributable to A1g modes, and the peaks at 255, 302, 418, 617, and 820\u00a0cm\u22121 correspond to Eg modes. High intensity peak observed at 1324\u00a0cm\u22121 represents 2-magnon scattering evolved due to interactivity of the magnons originated on antiparallel close spin sites. The presence of all the characteristic Raman modes typical to hematite structure in the synthesized \u03b1-Fe2O3 confirms its excellent crystallinity and unerring synthesis [30]. We further recorded Raman spectra of CNFs and \u03b2-CD-CNFs as part of this work. Analyzing the Raman spectra of CNFs, presence of D and G band at 1350 and 1576\u00a0cm\u22121 can be observed. Additionaly, these bands can also be observed at 1350 and 1579\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively in \u03b2-CD-CNFs. Moreover, we can find that the intensity of D band has increased in \u03b2-CD-CNFs compared to CNFs due to an increase in disorder following the addition of \u03b2-CD to CNFs. Analyzing Raman spectrum of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs, we can observe peaks at 234, 255, 302, 418, and 617\u00a0cm\u22121 , corresponding to the characteristic A1g and Eg Raman modes of \u03b1-Fe2O3. The broad peak observed at 1324\u00a0cm\u22121 is due to the vibrational modes of \u03b1-Fe2O3 and \u03b2-CD-CNFs. Moreover, peak 1587\u00a0cm\u22121 represents the G band present in \u03b2-CD-CNFs. From these observations, it is evident that \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs was prepared successfully. Then, we evaluated the disorder degree in \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite based on the Raman spectra to analyze its flaws and disorder. The disorder degrees of CNFs, \u03b2-CD-CNFs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs were found to be 0.20, 0.35, and 0.82, respectively. Therefore, it. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "is evident that \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite with higher ID/IG ratio has more flaws and disorder than CNFs and \u03b2-CD-CNFs. FTIR spectroscopy is an important technique for determining characteristic groups existing in a material. In this work, we captured FTIR spectroscopy of \u03b2-CD-CNFs, \u03b1-Fe2O3, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs. Fig. 3B shows the FTIR spectroscopy results acquired for the aforementioned materials. Analyzing the results obtained for \u03b2-CD-CNFs, we can observe well-defined peaks at 3373, 2920, 2842, 1640, and 1035\u00a0cm\u22121. Among these, peak at 3373\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponds to OH stretching vibration and the peaks 2920 and 2842\u00a0cm\u22121 represent C H stretching vibrations. Moreover, C O stretching vibration is denoted by peak at 1640\u00a0cm\u22121 and C O stretching is attributable to peak at 1035\u00a0cm\u22121 [31]. Analyzing spectra of \u03b1-Fe2O3, different peaks at 3435, 1627, 1043, 573, and 442\u00a0cm\u22121 can be noticed. The OH stretching is represented by peak 3435\u00a0cm\u22121 and OH bending is represented by peak 1627\u00a0cm\u22121. Moreover, the peak observed at 1043\u00a0cm\u22121 is attributable to the Fe OH bending vibrations. Furthermore, the two peaks positioned at 573\u00a0cm\u22121 and 442\u00a0cm\u22121 correspond to Fe O lattice vibrations. From these observations it is apparent that \u03b1-Fe2O3 was successfully synthesized in this work [32,33]. In the FTIR spectrum of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs, the peak at 3461\u00a0cm\u22121 is due to the OH stretching vibration, while the peaks at 2929\u00a0cm\u22121 and 2851\u00a0cm\u22121 can be assigned to asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching vibrations, respectively, as observed in the FTIR spectrum of \u03b2-CD-CNFs. The peak at 1645\u00a0cm\u22121 is due to coincidence of C O stretching vibration and OH bending vibration, whereas the band at 1052\u00a0cm\u22121 is the result of C O stretch and Fe OH bend vibrations. The characteristic peaks representing Fe-O lattice vibrations as observed in \u03b1-Fe2O3 is positioned at 582\u00a0cm\u22121 and 455\u00a0cm\u22121 in the FTIR spectra of nanocomposite. The excellent interaction between \u03b1-Fe2O3 and \u03b2-CD-CNFs in the nanocomposite preparation is evident from this FTIR spectroscopy results. XPS was utilized for exploring surface composition and chemical state of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite. The survey data shown in Fig. 3C for the as-synthesized nanocomposite exhibits Fe 2p, O 1\u00a0s, and C 1\u00a0s at 712\u00a0eV, 532\u00a0eV, and 284\u00a0eV, respectively. The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum demonstrated in Fig. 3D was deconvoluted into two peaks at 711.9\u00a0eV and 725.2\u00a0eV, which can be attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. Moreover, the peaks obtained at the binding energy of 718.6\u00a0eV and 731.1\u00a0eV correspond to the satellite peaks of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 [34]. As shown in Fig. 3E, the C 1\u00a0s spectrum deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.6\u00a0eV, 286.6\u00a0eV, and 289.5\u00a0eV can be assigned to C\u00a0=\u00a0C/C-C, C-O, and O-C-O bonds present in \u03b2-CD-CNFs, respectively [35]. The deconvolution of O 1\u00a0s in Fig. 3F displaying the peaks centered at binding energy of 530.6\u00a0eV is associated with standard state of anionic oxygen present in \u03b1-Fe2O3, while the other two peaks at 533.5\u00a0eV, 534.8\u00a0eV are corresponding to the C O and C OH bond present in \u03b2-CD-CNFs [36]. EIS is an important characterization technique to explore the electron transfer properties and kinetics of the electrode reactions. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) equivalent to the diameter of the semicircle in EIS spectra is inversely correlated to the electrochemical activity of the material. Fig. 4 A shows the Nyquist plots of bare SPCE, \u03b1-Fe2O3/SPCE, CNFs/SPCE, \u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE. Randles equivalent circuit was utilized to fit all the EIS data, and the corresponding circuit is also displayed in Fig. 4A. From the EIS results, the bare SPCE has the largest semicircle with Rct value of 1928\u00a0\u03a9, which indicates an inferior electrocatalytic performance. When the electrode surface was modified with \u03b1-Fe2O3, the Rct value significantly decreased to 1136\u00a0\u03a9, which represents moderate electron transfer behavior of \u03b1-Fe2O3. Interestingly, a drastic reduction in Rct values was attained when the electrode surface was modified with CNFs (Rct = 491\u00a0\u03a9)or \u03b2-CD-CNFs (Rct = 315\u00a0\u03a9). However, \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs modified SPCE has exhibited the smallest semicircle diameter with Rct of 78\u00a0\u03a9, indicating the excellent electron transfer capacity, which might be due to the synergistic effect between \u03b2-CD-CNFs and \u03b1-Fe2O3. Electrochemical performance of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE towards carbendazim detection was analyzed by conducting a comparative performance evaluation of different modified electrodes. This experiment was conducted using cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique, and results are depicted in Fig. 4B. The performance evaluation\u00a0experiment was performed in 0.05\u00a0M phosphate buffer (PB) solution (pH 7.0) comprising 100\u00a0\u03bcM carbendazim at 100\u00a0mV/s. We recorded the voltammograms of bare SPCE, \u03b1-Fe2O3/SPCE, CNFs/SPCE, \u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE, \u03b1-Fe2O3/CNF/SPCE, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE. Analyzing resultant CV curves of aforementioned electrodes in Fig. 4B, it is clearly noticeable that the weakest response was exhibited by the bare SPCE. This weak response with very low oxidation current indicates the mediocre electrocatalytic activity of the bare SPCE. Voltammetric response of \u03b1-Fe2O3/SPCE towards carbendazim displays an oxidation peak with peak potential of 0.83\u00a0V. In addition, CNFs/SPCE and \u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE showcase their oxidation peaks at 0.80 and 0.78\u00a0V, respectively, whereas the oxidation peak of \u03b1-Fe2O3/CNF/SPCE appears at 0.81\u00a0V. Clearly, CV responses of \u03b1-Fe2O3/SPCE, CNFs/SPCE, \u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/CNFs/SPCE have demonstrated weaker oxidation peak currents and higher peak potentials compared to those of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE. Furthermore, the peak current of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE is 15 times higher than bare SPCE. This can be ascribed by the synergetic effect of \u03b1-Fe2O3 and \u03b2-CD-CNFs in the nanocomposite, which contributes to the good host\u2013guest recognition capability, excellent electron mobility, high electroactive surface area, and good enrichment capacity towards carbendazim. The improved performance of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE for the selective detection of carbendazim can be explained partially by the enhanced contact area generated by \u03b2-CD-CNFs for the selective molecular interaction with the target analyte. The presence of \u03b1-Fe2O3 leads to an even higher surface area, which enhances the electrical conductivity and electron transfer within the \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite matrix. As a result, the cumulative action of \u03b2-CD on CNFs and \u03b1-Fe2O3 produces a large sensing surface for improved carbendazim detection. The anodic peak at 0.74\u00a0V observed in the cyclic voltammogram of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE is attributed to the oxidation of double bond of carbamate in carbendazim, a reaction involving two electrons and 2 protons. This leads to the generation of an amide and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "a heterocyclic radical, a proof of swift electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte. We have also studied photo-assisted electrochemical analysis of various modified electrodes in the presence of 100\u00a0\u03bcM carbendazim at 100\u00a0mV/s using the CV technique. As shown in Fig. S1, \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE has exhibited a well defined peak at 0.76\u00a0V with the highest peak current compared to all the other modified electrodes. Based on the above inferences from experimental results, we can affirm that \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE is apt for sensitive electrochemical detection of carbendazim. Scheme S1 shows electrochemical oxidation process of carbendazim. The experiment for analyzing pH impact on the electrochemical determination of carbendazim using the prepared modified electrode was conducted. Fig. 4C denotes CV responses at various pH of electrolyte, and we can clearly find that the peak potential increases with decreasing pH of the electrolyte. We can observe the highest peak potential at pH 3.0 and lowest at pH 11.0. On the other hand, in case of peak current, we couldn\u2019t observe a linear relationship with pH as in the case of peak potential. The highest peak current for \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE towards carbendazim detection was observed at pH 7.0, which was opted as the optimal pH for carbendazim determination. Fig. 4D shows how oxidation current and potential change with pH, and the regression equation E pa (V)\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.058pH\u00a0+\u00a01.2256 (R 2\u00a0=\u00a00.9808) is obtained. The slope value 58\u00a0mV/pH determined from this regression equation is in good agreement with the Nernst equation. Electroactive surface area is an important trait of a material. It has a direct impact on the electrocatalytic performance of that material. Therefore, we determined the area of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite. CV technique was utilized for determining electroactive surface area and we recorded the cyclic voltammograms of unmodified SPCE and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE in 0.1\u00a0M KCl comprising 5\u00a0mM [Fe(CN)6]\u22123/\u22124 at various scan rates in the range of 20 \u2013 200 mVs\u22121. Fig. 5 A and 5C depict the resultant voltammetric curves of unmodified SPCE and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE, respectively. Moreover, we explored the linear relationship between redox peak current and the square root of scan rate from the resultant CV responses of bare SPCE and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE, as shown in Fig. 5B and 5D, respectively. From these linear plots, we determined the regression equations and the corresponding slope values were estimated. Moreover, we have also carried out CV analyses of \u03b2-CD/SPCE, \u03b1-Fe2O3/SPCE, CNFs/SPCE, and \u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE to find out the electroactive surface areas of various modified SPCEs. Fig. S2 and S3 demonstrate the resultant CV responses and linear plots of redox peak current versus the square root of scan rate. Furthermore, according to Randles Sevcik formula in equation (1), we calculated the surface area [37]. Ip=2.69\u00d7105AD1/2v1/2n3/2C The calculated electroactive surface areas of bare SPCE, \u03b2-CD/SPCE, \u03b1-Fe2O3/SPCE, CNFs/SPCE, \u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE are 0.028\u00a0cm2, 0.059\u00a0cm2, 0.070\u00a0cm2, 0.122\u00a0cm2, 0.191\u00a0cm2 and 0.210\u00a0cm2, respectively. Therefore, the electroactive surface area of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE is 7.5 times higher than that of unmodified SPCE. Based on the observation, it is apparent that \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE has superior electroactive surface area and is thus a good choice for electrocatalytic applications. Here, we conducted electrochemical experiments using the CV technique to evaluate the dependency of electrocatalytic activity of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE on carbendazim concentration. We consecutively added carbendazim in the range of 50\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcM to 0.05\u00a0M\u00a0PB solution, and the respective voltammetric curves are recorded at 100\u00a0mV/s. Analyzing resultant responses shown in Fig. S4A, we can see that peak current and addition of carbendazim are directly proportional. It is noted that the linear increase of peak current with carbendazim addition is steady as the difference in peak current between two consecutive additions are the same in the concentration range considered. Fig. S4B shows the linear relationship between oxidation peak current and carbendazim addition, and the linear regression equation estimated from Fig. S4B is y\u00a0=\u00a00.1364x\u00a0+\u00a020.63 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9996). The effect of scan rate on electrochemical performance of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE towards carbendazim detection was investigated. Cyclic voltammetric curves of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE in 0.05\u00a0PB solution comprising carbendazim at different scan rates (10\u00a0mV/s \u2013 200\u00a0mV/s) are recorded, and these curves are depicted in Fig. S4C. The linear relationship between oxidation peak current and scan rate is displayed in Fig. S4D, along with the regression equation I pa\u00a0=\u00a00.2946x\u00a0+\u00a03.9426 (\u03bcA, mV s\u22121, R 2\u00a0=\u00a00.9962). In order to verify the electrochemical reaction process of carbendazim at \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE, we evaluated the relation of log (Ipa) against log (scan rate) and confirmed that the electrochemical oxidation of carbendazim at \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE is a surface controlled process. Electrochemical detection of carbendazim using the prepared modified electrode was performed using the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique in this work. There are various significant merits for DPV technique in electrochemical investigations including excellent sensitivity and precision. The voltammetric curves from this DPV analysis based on \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE are depicted in Fig. 6 A. When we analyze the resultant voltammetric curves, the direct proportionality of carbendazim concentration and oxidation peak current is evident. It is also noted that the oxidation peak potential remains stable even when carbendazim concentration increases. This indicates high precision in carbendazim detection based on \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE. A linear plot of oxidation peak current against carbendazim concentration is shown in Fig. 6B. We obtained two linear ranges, one at lower concentration region and another at higher concentration region. We further estimated the regression equations for both the lower and higher concentration regions, and they are I (\u00b5A)\u00a0=\u00a02.7485x\u00a0+\u00a06.213 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9905) and I (\u00b5A)\u00a0=\u00a00.1807x\u00a0+\u00a016.2004 (R2\u00a0=\u00a09961), respectively. We achieved ultra-low detection limit of 1\u00a0nM under the linear range 0.06\u2013309.75\u00a0\u00b5M. Moreover, we have calculated the sensitivity of carbendazim determination, and it is found to be 37.69 \u00b5A \u00b5M\u22121 cm\u22122. In addition, photo-assisted electrochemical determination of carbendazim was also analyzed using the DPV technique, and the resultant current responses are shown in Fig. S6. It is noted that the oxidation peak current steadily increases as the concentration of carbendazim increases, and the peak potential remains constant even at high concentrations of carbendazim. The oxidation peak current versus concentration plot exhibits a linear relationship from 0.018 to 29.32\u00a0\u00b5M. The regression equations of the lower and higher concentration regions are I (\u00b5A)\u00a0=\u00a06.5746x\u00a0+\u00a016.069 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9939) and I (\u00b5A)\u00a0=\u00a02.9348x\u00a0+\u00a023.135 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9931), respectively. The 0.57\u00a0nM. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "LOD was calculated from the lower concentration region. Interestingly, sensitivity of photo-assisted electrochemical detection of carbendazim is 90.18 \u00b5A \u00b5M\u22121 cm\u22122, which is much higher than the sensitivity of photo-free detection. Table S1 compares the results attained in this work with other reported works on carbendazim detection. When we examine Table S1, we can undoubtedly affirm that the proposed modified electrode exhibits exceptional performance in carbendazim determination. Moreover, from this DPV analysis, we could confirm that \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs is an excellent material for carbendazim determination. One of the significant issues faced by electrochemical sensors is the interference of concomitant species during detection process. The presence of these concomitant species during detection process can adversely affect the accuracy of electrochemical detection. Consequently, anti-interference property of the proposed carbendazim sensor was evaluated. This experiment was conducted using the DPV method and resultant responses of developed sensor in presence of 10\u00a0\u00b5M carbendazim and common interfering compounds were analyzed. The interfering species we have chosen for this experiment include 100-fold excess concentration of interfering inorganic ions such as magnesium (Mg2+), copper (Cu2+), zinc (Zn2+), chloride (Cl\u2212), nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), carbonate (CO32-) and 5-fold excess concentration of some key pesticide species, such as diphenylamine (DPA), thiabendazole (TBZ), benomyl (BNM), chlorpyrifos (CPS), and diuron (DU). Fig. 7 A displays response current changes of carbendazim sensor in the existence of these common interfering species. From this plot, only slight deviation in peak current response towards carbendazim detection can be observed even when the aforementioned interfering species are present, indicating good selectivity. The maximum deviation noted is mere 4.31%. According to above inferences, we can affirm that the proposed carbendazim sensor exhibits excellent anti-interference property. In this work, we analyzed the reproducibility of developed carbendazim sensor. We fabricated 10 identical \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCEs and the voltammetric responses of these electrodes towards carbendazim detection were investigated. Fig. 7B depicts resultant peak current responses we attained for 10 identical \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCEs. Analysis of Fig. 7B clearly shows that these peak current responses are very similar and only insignificant changes in peak current value can be observed, indicating excellent reproducibility of the proposed sensor. We further estimated the relative standard deviation (RSD) and found it to be mere 3.67%. Hence, we can assert that the proposed carbendazim sensor has good reproducibility. In this work, repeatability property was evaluated by taking 10 successive voltammetric readings of developed carbendazim sensor. The 10 successive peak current responses we have observed for the proposed carbendazim sensor based on \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE are depicted in Fig. 7C. Analysis of these curves demonstrates that only insignificant variation exists in current responses for all 10 successive readings. We further estimated the RSD of peak current values for the 10 repetitions, and a mere 2.34% value was observed. Therefore, according to the above inferences, we could affirm carbendazim sensor based on \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE possess good repeatability property. It is critical that an electrochemical sensor should be highly reliable, and good stability is an important trait of a reliable sensor. Therefore, stability of the proposed carbendazim sensor based on \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs/SPCE was evaluated. We tested whether the proposed electrochemical sensor\u2019s reading varied with time. This stability analysis experiment was conducted for 28\u00a0days. Resultant voltammetric curves were recorded and analyzed, and the peak current was noted every 4\u00a0days for 28\u00a0days. The resultant peak currents observed in this experiment are given in Fig. 7D. When we examine Fig. 7D, we can clearly notice that peak current response variation with time is very small. An insignificant reduction of 4.6% was observed after 28\u00a0days. These observations from this stability analysis experiment substantiate the excellent stability of proposed carbendazim sensor. We have evaluated the practical feasibility of proposed carbendazim sensor in this work. This experiment was conducted based on DPV technique using real samples prepared from apple, tomato, orange, and river water. The fruit and vegetable samples were bought from a local market, whereas the river water was collected from Tamsui river, Taiwan. Prior to the analysis of fruit and vegetable samples, they were cut into small pieces and crushed with an electric blender. The resultant product was collected and centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min. Then, the supernatant separated from the solid portion was diluted with the PB solution. The voltammetric responses of the proposed carbendazim sensor in the prepared real sample solutions were then analyzed as given in Fig. 8 . Table 1 displays experimental results attained from this experiment for different real samples. The recovery of carbendazim estimated in all real samples is between 96.60% and 102.20%. Furthermore, resultant RSD values obtained for each real sample using the proposed sensor are between 1.17 and 2.44 %. The low RSD and almost 100% recovery of carbendazim indicate excellent practical feasibility of the proposed sensor. Photocatalytic degradation of the colorless fungicide carbendazim under visible light irradiation was evaluated with a UV\u2013Vis spectrometer. The photocatalytic activity of \u03b1-Fe2O3, CNFs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs for the degradation of carbendazim are illustrated in Fig. 9 A. In the absence of catalyst, a slight change in carbendazim concentration after 120\u00a0min indicates insignificant photolysis of carbendazim under visible light irradiation. On the other hand, degradation rates after 120 min attained by \u03b1-Fe2O3, CNFs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite were found to be 15.3%, 53.8%, and 93.5%, respectively. Outstanding photocatalytic activity of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs towards carbendazim degradation was evident from its comparatively highest degradation rate. Fig. 9B demonstrates absorption spectra of carbendazim solution in the presence of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs over time. The better photocatalytic activity of \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs might be a result of enhanced electron-hole pair separation.  In this work, we have achieved the successful determination and degradation of the hazardous fungicide carbendazim based on a novel \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite. Surface functionalization of CNFs with \u03b2-CD and synthesis of olive-like \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were successfully carried out as part of this work for the preparation of dual-functional \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite. Various electrochemical studies based on CV and DPV techniques confirmed the excellent surface-controlled electrocatalytic activity of the prepared nanocomposite towards the detection of carbendazim. The resultant low limit of detection, excellent sensitivity, and wide linear range exhibited. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "by the developed sensor indicate outstanding electrochemical performance. Moreover, the excellent selectivity, stability, reproducibility, repeatability, and practicality showcased by the carbendazim sensor have further proved its reliability. Based on various results obtained from this work, we could conclude that the novel \u03b1-Fe2O3/\u03b2-CD-CNFs nanocomposite is exceptional in the sensitive detection and degradation of carbendazim.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2017.07.076.txt", "paper": ["Transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs), as a means of electron transfer, are indispensable components of various optoelectronic devices, such as touchscreens, displays, solar cells, and photodetectors . For these TCEs, optical transmittance and sheet resistance are among the most important parameter considerations; the device response time decreases (i.e., the response is faster) for higher optical transmittance and lower sheet resistance. For these reasons, indium-doped tin oxide (ITO), with a low sheet resistance (<\u223c10 \u03a9/sq.) and high optical transmittance (>80% at 550 nm), is used widely for TCEs . However, due to several limitations, ITO has been used only in specific research areas, despite its desirable optical and electrical properties versus other TCEs. Indium, which affects the electrical conductivity of tin oxide (SnO2), is a limited resource (a rare earth metal) and has low chemical stability in acidic and basic conditions , as well as a brittle, ceramic nature . Thus, finding alternative TCE materials, such as carbon-based materials, metal nanowires, and conductive polymers, to replace ITO has been an important issue. Another commercial TCE material is fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), which is generally fabricated using a sputtering or sol-gel process. It is possible to obtain uniform thicknesses of FTO film via sputtering methods; however, the manufacturing cost is considerably high compared with other processes, as sputtering requires high-vacuum systems . Moreover, FTO thin-film fabrication requires high annealing temperatures through a sol-gel process and, similar to ITO, FTO is sensitive to chemical reactions, such as with acids and bases . Thus, replacements are needed for ITO and FTO-glass in conventional TCEs. Among various replacement materials for commercial TCEs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show high transmittance and sheet resistance above 500 \u03a9/sq. . Although graphene, another carbon-based material, is able to overcome the high sheet resistance problems of CNT, it requires high-temperature processes to produce high-quality films . Metal nanowires, which are inexpensive and conductive, have been considered for use in TCEs. Silver nanowire (AgNW) is easy to synthesize in solution and to fabricate in TCEs by spin-coating and dip-coating methods . However, the rough surface of AgNWs results in low efficiency, due to its weak adhesion to the substrate . Studies by Lu et al. and Khaligh et al. proposed strategies to solve these problems using AgNWs embedded in polymer films . In addition to metal nanowires, conductive polymers (e.g. Polyanilines, Polypyrrole, and Polythiophenes) can be used in TCEs with simple methods, such as spin coating, spray coating, and dip coating. Moreover, the polymer conducting film reveals uniform and flat surface morphology on the various shape of substrate . Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is a promising conducting polymer, and shows relatively good thermal stability and electrical properties compared to that of other polythiophenes. PEDOT is a common conductive polymer for TCE and can be used simultaneously as an electrochromic (EC) material . TCEs composed of PEDOT alone, shows very high sheet resistance due to its poor electrical properties due to interface segregation . PEDOT can be stabilized in an aqueous solution of poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS), which is a primary dopant for PEDOT. The PSS is one of the most widely used additives to improve electrical properties. After primary doping, PEDOT:PSS has formed polymeric complex structure, which the PSS chain was effectively balanced to the doping charges with PEDOT. Due to PSS, this interface segregation among PEDOTs is minimized to improve charge transport properties, leading to good electrical characteristics . Moreover, conducting polymers based on PEDOT through secondary doping using other dopants, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol, have their own unique qualities . PEDOT-based polymers have been used via compounding with CNT, graphene, and metal nanowires to fabricate hybrid films with improved electrical properties . As mentioned above, PEDOT, as a conducting polymer, can also be used as an EC material, with the ability to change color reversibly based on electrochemical oxidation and reduction. When an external voltage is applied, the color change occurs by desorption or absorption of ions and electrons in the EC film. For EC devices based on PEDOT, supported particles such as WO3, CNT, and TiO2, can be added to PEDOT to improve its coloration efficiency, while PEDOT:PSS can be doped with silver and gold nanoparticles (Table 1 ) . Among the various dopants, TiO2 is preferable for EC films, because it is the most important wide-band gap semiconductor. Several fabrication processes have been used to prepare porous TiO2 thin layers. Ma et al. reported TiO2 layer formation using crystalline TiO2 powder dispersed in a polymer solution and then spin coated with annealing at 450 \u00b0C . Cai et al. fabricated TiO2 nanorods on FTO glass using a hydrothermal process . Gui et al. fabricated a W-Ti film using magnetron sputtering deposition; electrochemical anodization was conducted on the pure W-Ti layer to obtain a WO3-TiO2 composite layer as an EC film . The processes described in these studies for TiO2 layer formation tend to be complex and require high annealing temperatures. A simple, inexpensive process is required for porous TiO2 film fabrication. Previous reported works were mainly bi-composite film for the application of electrode, but development of tri-composite film for the application of both TCEs and EC device, has never been reported . Given this background, we sought to fabricate hybrid films composed of TiO2/AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS layers on glass substrates and to use these films as TCEs and EC films simultaneously in EC devices. Here, TiO2 particles were deposited on glass substrates using a nanoparticle deposition system (NPDS), a dry deposition method (Fig. S1). AgNWs were added to improve the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS. The proposed TiO2/AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid film demonstrated improved electron transfer mobility and response current compared with a AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS film. The optimized hybrid film fabricated by dry deposition followed by spin coating showed stable EC performance in terms of cycling stability and response time for switching between coloring and bleaching. Based on various analyses, we present a simple, low-cost method for fabricating TCEs via dry deposition and spin coating, with the resulting TCE used as an EC device. . but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Commercially available glass (Marienfeld Laboratory Glassware, Germany) with a thickness of 1.0 mm was used as the substrate. The glass substrate (area: 25 \u00d7 25 mm2) was cleaned ultrasonically in 99.9% ethanol (Daejung, Korea) for 10 min. After cleaning, the substrate was dried in air. The substrate was then dipped in 50 mL deionized (DI) water with 0.22 mL TiCl4 solution (titanium (IV) chloride, Junsei, Japan) and placed in an oven for 30 min at 70 \u00b0C. The sample was then rinsed thoroughly with DI water. TiO2 particles (average diameter: 15 nm; Nanoamor, USA) deposited on the glass substrate were treated with TiCl4, followed by a dry deposition process (Fig. S1). The TiO2 film was dry deposited at a scanning speed of 5000 \u03bcm/s through a nozzle (size: 10 \u00d7 3 mm2; aerosol flow rate: 27.5 L/min; injection pressure: 3 bar; stand-off distance (SoD): 1 mm). An ion-storage layer (area: 20 \u00d7 25 mm2; thickness: 120 nm) was deposited on the glass substrate via NPDS. Finally, blown air was used to remove residual TiO2 powder, revealing dense TiO2 deposition on the glass. A 1.5 wt% PEDOT:PSS solution was prepared by adding 0.3 g of PEDOT:PSS dry pellets to 19.70 mL of DI water. The solution was stirred for 24 h for good dispersion, resulting in a deep blue-black PEDOT:PSS mixture. An AgNW dispersion (NTC-01, Nanopyxis, Korea), 1.0 wt% AgNW in ethanol, without and with a TiO2 film for AgNW/PEDOT:PSS and TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS fabrication, was used to coat the entire area of the substrate. Specifically, AgNW was spin-coated (2000 rpm, 60 s) onto the substrate; uniform coverage without or with the TiO2 film was confirmed. Subsequently, PEDOT:PSS solution was adsorbed directly onto the pre-deposited AgNW thin film at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the PEDOT:PSS solution was adsorbed to the nanoporous TiO2 film; residual solution was removed from the TiO2 film by spin-coating (1500 rpm, 60 s). Thus, the hybrid film structure was formed via spin-coating PEDOT:PSS onto AgNW networks with dry deposition of TiO2, resulting in a total thickness of \u223c700 nm. The electrical and structural properties of the TCEs of AgNW/PEDOT:PSS and TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS were compared after secondary doping with ethylene glycol; the TCEs were dipped in ethylene glycol for 30 min. After doping, the TCEs were annealed at 200 \u00b0C for 20 min in an argon atmosphere. Fig. 1 shows the fabrication process of the TCE. Antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) particles with an average diameter of 30 nm (JL Chem. Co., Ltd, Korea) were dry deposited at a scanning speed of 4000 \u03bcm/s onto ITO glass through a nozzle with a size of 10 \u00d7 3 mm2 at 150 \u00b0C. The SoD was fixed at 3 mm, the aerosol flow rate was 27.5 L/min, and the injection pressure was 3 bar. As a result of the deposition, an ion-storage layer with an area of 10 \u00d7 10 mm2 was obtained; the thickness of this film was \u223c400 nm. Surlyn film (thickness: 300 \u03bcm) was used as a thermal adhesive between the hybrid film and the ion-storage layer. An ionic liquid electrolyte, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMIM-TFSI), was injected into the EC device through drilled holes. Finally, the EC device was fabricated by sealing these holes using tape. X-ray diffraction (XRD; TTR II, Rigaku, Japan) with a Cu-K\u03b1 beam was used to investigate the phase change of TiO2 before and after deposition. The surface morphology and microstructure of the nanoporous TiO2 film, AgNW, and PEDOT:PSS through the adsorption and annealing steps, were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Mira 3, Tescan, Czech Republic). The transmittance of the fabricated TCEs, AgNW/PEDOT:PSS, and TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS and commercially available ITO- and FTO-glass were measured with an ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometer (VS650, Jasco, Japan). The sheet resistances of the films were examined with a four-point probe (Chang Min Co., Ltd., Korea). The films were evaluated to confirm the properties of the TCEs with respect to transmittance and sheet resistance. TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS was evaluated for use as an EC film. The hybrid EC cell structure was composed of glass | TiO2 | AgNW | PEDOT:PSS || EMIM-TFSI || ATO | ITO | glass. The EC properties were measured with a UV spectrophotometer using a potentiostat (Versa STAT4, Princeton, NJ, USA). The optical transmittance of the EC device was recorded over the range of \u22122.0 V to +2.0 V, between colored and bleached states, over the wavelength range of 300\u2013900 nm. Finally, the cyclic potential in cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements was scanned at a rate of 50 mV/s from \u22122.0 V to +2.0 V.  XRD was used to monitor changes in the TiO2 phase before and after deposition through collision with the substrate (Fig. 2 ). Commercial TiO2 powder showed sharp peaks for anatase and rutile phases. The powder showed two TiO2 phases, with a relatively small amount of the rutile phase. When this powder was deposited on glass with TiCl4 treatment using the dry deposition process, a broad peak for the amorphous glass was observed at 15\u201338\u00b0 . Due to this broad peak, the low-intensity peaks of the Anatase phase at 25.3, 47.9, 54.1, 55.0, and 63.0\u00b0 were difficult to discern (Fig. 2(b)). Therefore, we have used FTO-glass as a deposition substrate since crystallinity of FTO-glass as a substrate can show clear crystalline peaks of deposited TiO2. As shown in Fig. S3, TiO2 powder was successfully deposited on FTO-glass showing clear crystalline peaks of Anatase phase. Therefore, XRD analysis confirmed that there was no phase change in TiO2 after dry deposition on the glass substrate. Fig. 3 (a) shows SEM images of a nanoporous TiO2 film deposited on a glass substrate. AgNW formed uniform networks without agglomerating on the TiO2 film. The PEDOT:PSS layer on top of AgNW with TiO2 after annealing and secondary doping is shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively. Secondary doping with ethylene glycol is known to improve the conductivity of PEDOT . In particular, coating the AgNW layer with PEDOT:PSS serves dual functions, as it improves the conductivity of the electrode and smoothes the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "surface . The coating also enhances the number of fused junctions in AgNW networks, leading to a decrease in resistance with annealing . The hybrid film was successfully formed with stacks of TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS. Fig. 4 shows measured optical transmittance and electrical conductivity results of TCEs. The fabricated TCEs (PEDOT:PSS, AgNW/PEDOT:PSS, TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS on glass) were compared with commercial TCEs, such as ITO-glass (UID, Korea) and FTO-glass (Pilkington, USA). Samples were prepared on glass substrates, as stated in the experimental procedures. The purchased ITO- and FTO-glass were found to have higher average transmittances, above 75% from 300 to 900 nm, and lower sheet resistance, below \u223c10 \u03a9/sq., than the fabricated TCEs. The fabricated TCE based on PEDOT:PSS on a glass substrate showed similar optical transmittances to those of the commercial TCEs, but the sheet resistance was above 500 \u03a9/sq., indicating that it would be difficult for PEDOT:PSS on a glass substrate alone to be used as a TCE. Moreover, the sheet resistance of the fabricated PEDOT:PSS on a glass substrate was not sufficiently uniform to be used as a TCE. Thus, we added AgNW to the PEDOT:PSS film to improve its electrical conductivity. Studies by Jensen et al. showed that an electrode substrate with Ag/PEDOT/PET had an optical transmittance value of \u223c40%, similar to our results . Although the AgNW/PEDOT:PSS and TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS TCEs showed low optical properties, their sheet resistance values were reduced below 20 \u03a9/sq.. The fabricated TCEs show lower optical properties with a gain in electrical conductivity of 26 times through the addition of a thin layer of dispersed AgNWs. Moreover, TiO2, as a semiconductor material applied to other TCEs, showed slightly reduced optical and electrical properties versus those of the AgNW/PEDOT:PSS TCE. TiO2 was added to this TCE so that an EC device could be fabricated, as explained below. External voltages were applied to AgNW/PEDOT:PSS and TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS film on glass (Fig. 5 ). Fig. 5(b) shows the response current results with applied external voltages. Response current switches for the AgNW/PEDOT:PSS and TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid films between 0 V (voltage off) and +2.0 V (voltage on) were applied, each step for 60 s. As a result, the AgNW/PEDOT:PSS film showed a lower response current, below 0.5 mA, than that of the TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid film. This hybrid film showed a stable current value, about 2.0 mA, as the voltage was switched from 0 to +2.0 V. The nanoporous TiO2 layer added to the AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid film reduced the optical and electrical properties of the hybrid film, while its response current appeared to be relatively stable and enhanced by about four-fold. In the hybrid film that included the nanoporous TiO2 layer, the nanoparticles seemed to improve electron transport via additional conduction pathways. That is, two different electron paths can be achieved through these hybrid films . Path transport into the PEDOT:PSS medium is one potential path (Fig. 6 (a)). Electron transport into the nanoporous TiO2 layer and moving through the interface between PEDOT:PSS and TiO2 metal oxide particles can be considered as a second path (Fig. 6(b)). These dual electron paths contributed to the improved response current (four-fold increase), in TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS. Thus, the TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid film was selected for use as an EC film; we evaluated its EC performance, as described in the next section. To evaluate EC film composed of the TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid TCE, the ion-storage layer of ATO was deposited onto ITO-glass; an EMIM-TFSI electrolyte was used. Fig. 7 shows the optical transmittance spectra of the colored and bleached states over the wavelength range of 300\u2013900 nm. In the bleached state, the transmittance of the hybrid film was 47% when applying +2.0 V for 60 s at a wavelength of 630 nm. However, its optical transmittance was reduced to 24% at a constant potential of \u22122.0 V for 60 s at the same wavelength. Thus, the EC performance showed a maximum transmittance difference of 23% between the bleached and colored states at 630 nm. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the coloration efficiency of the hybrid film was calculated to be 127.83 cm2/C, based on its charge value, similar to the previously reported results of organic with metal oxide composite films. Xiong et al. reported that a polyaniline-TiO2 composite showed a coloration efficiency of 81 cm2/C . Guofa Cai et al. reported 37.1 cm2/C at 700 nm for a polyaniline-TiO2 core/shell nano-rod array . In another study, PEDOT:PSS-WO3 film was used as an EC film, showing a coloration efficiency of 74.6 cm2/C . Thus, the EC device fabricated here showed superior coloration efficiency. Dynamic transmittance was recorded under switching potentials between \u22122.0 V and +2.0 V for 60-s time intervals. The difference in dynamic transmittance was as low as 8% initially, as shown in Fig. 8 (a); EC performance has improved up to the maximum value of 31% at 3600 s and showed its stable switching property with a slight decreasing of only 1% for 3 h. Additionally, the colored and bleached shifts required a response time that was based on an optical transmittance change of 90% at the wavelength of 630 nm. The time for colored and bleached switching was calculated to be 22.0 s at a transmittance of 25.38% and 5.5 s at a transmittance of 45.90%, respectively (Fig. 8(b)). These results were similar to other reported polymer-based EC performances . Additionally, the long-term durability for application as an EC device was monitored (Fig. 8(c)). CV measurements were conducted to investigate EC performance stability. The cyclic potential was scanned at a rate of 50 mV/s from \u22122.0 V to +2.0 V. The CV curve maintained its shape over 50 cycles, as shown in Fig. 8(c). Thus, the EC device was shown to be stable. Fig. 9 shows electron\u2013hole transport in the EC film. Here, the role of the nanoporous TiO2 film in the hybrid film composed of AgNW, TiO2, and PEDOT:PSS, can be explained in terms of an energy level diagram. Generally, PEDOT:PSS, the p-type conducting polymer, forms heterostructure with TiO2 film, n-type semiconductor, as it is called \u2018p-n heterojunction\u2019. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", ". The p-n heterojunction shows several advantages; (1) creating electrical field in the charge region, (2) more effective separation of electrons and holes and (3) fast charge transfer . As shown in Fig. 9(c), the electrons in the conduction band (CB) of PEDOT:PSS were transferred to that of TiO2 n-type semiconductor since the CB of TiO2 is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS . Moreover, the electrons at CB of semiconductor were more effective transferred through AgNW as conductive metal. On the other hand, when the valence band (VB) of PEDOT:PSS is higher than that of TiO2, the holes in the VB of TiO2 film were moved to that of PEDOT:PSS film. This energy level mismatch between AgNW and PEDOT:PSS causes an energetic barrier in the EC device, however, the work function of the TiO2 layer matched that of PEDOT:PSS. Thus, it is a suitable interfacial layer between AgNW and PEDOT:PSS . As a result, a new type of EC film composed of a tri-composite materials, improved its electrochemical performance due to effective redox reaction based on the energy level, specifically TiO2 layer providing a basis for p-n heterojunction. Based on this improved electrochemical performance, the EC device using the TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS hybrid film demonstrated dual performance, as a TCE and an EC film through the various analyses shown above.  A TCE electrode, composed of TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS, with improved electrical conductivity and stable coloration as an EC device, was developed in this study. This hybrid film used AgNW and PEDOT:PSS to improve upon the electrical properties offered by commercial TCEs, such as those using ITO and FTO films. Additionally, a nanoporous TiO2 film was dry deposited to enhance the active surface area as well as providing a basis for p-n heterojunction in the hybrid film to improve electrochemical performance. The sheet resistance of this tri-composite was measured to be \u223c20 \u03a9/sq., which is similar to that of commercial TCEs, such as ITO and FTO films. Moreover, the fabricated TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS was assessed as an EC film, along with ATO film on ITO-glass as an ion-storage layer. The difference in optical transmittance between colored and bleached states was measured to be 23% at 630 nm from \u22122.0 to +2.0 V, while the cyclic transmittance results, tested for 3 h, showed stable and improved optical transmittance of 31%. The coloration efficiency of the developed EC device was measured to be 127.83 cm2/C which is superior to the reported values. Finally, CV measurements of the fabricated cell showed stable CV characteristics up to 50 cycles. Thus, the EC device composed of a TiO2/AgNW/PEDOT:PSS film, operated successfully without a commercial TCE film.

The high cost, inadequate performance, and chemical instability found in many simple \u201cbasis oxides\u201d such as In2O3, ZnO, and SnO2 has motivated a search for alternative TCOs that are less expensive but still possess sufficient electrical and optical properties . One promising system is the series of layered indium zinc oxide (IZO) compounds with the formula In2O3(ZnO)k, where k is an integer. Compounds in this system can possess excellent optical transparency and conductivity similar to that of pure In2O3 in thin film form while containing significantly less In, which reduces their cost . In addition to transparency and electrical conductivity, energy band alignment between solar cell components plays a critical role in determining device performance. In organic solar cells in particular, the work function of the TCO is a key property affecting the band alignment . Other surface potentials, such as the Fermi energy and ionization potential, also have an effect on inorganic thin film solar cells . The relationship between these energy levels is illustrated by Fig. 1 . The fundamental band gap (E g0), the difference between the energies of the conduction band minimum (E CBM) and valence band maximum (E VBM), should be greater than 3 eV to ensure good visible transparency. The effective band gap, however, can be altered in degenerate semiconductors by reduction or donor doping, which can move the Fermi level (E F) into the conduction band (known as the Burstein\u2013Moss shift). The ionization potential is the energy necessary to move an electron from the valence band to the vacuum level, and the work function (WF) is defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level (E vac) and the Fermi level. This means that a material's work function is not a constant, but can be modified by doping, which can change the Fermi level, or by altering the surface dipole, which shifts the ionization potential (IP). These surface energy levels, and their dependence on material composition and processing, have been well characterized for \u201cbasis\u201d TCOs such as Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) . However, very little is known about the surface properties of many complex, multi-cation TCOs. In particular, the In2O3(ZnO)k system has been difficult to study because of its complex crystal structure . The present work investigated the work function, Fermi level, and other surface electronic properties of polycrystalline In2O3(ZnO)k compounds for k = 2 (thin film) and k = 3, 5, 7, and 9 (bulk). Surface energy levels of TCOs are typically measured using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) under vacuum. This method provides an accurate measurement of these energy levels without interference from surface contaminants. However, because many thin film deposition procedures and applications occur in atmospheres rather than under vacuum, it is also useful to understand the surface behavior under ambient conditions. For this reason, we have also measured the work function of these materials under ambient atmosphere using the Kelvin probe method .  Bulk samples of In2O3(ZnO)k (k = 3, 5, 7, and 9) were obtained by conventional solid state synthesis. Stoichiometric amounts of In2O3 (99.99%, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) and ZnO (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) were thoroughly mixed and uniaxially pressed into pellets at 150 MPa, which were calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 12 h in air. To limit Zn loss due to vaporization and prevent contamination from the crucible wall at high temperatures, each pellet was surrounded by a bed of sacrificial powder of the same composition and placed inside several nested crucibles. After the calcination step the pellets were ground and repressed, then sintered at 1300 \u00b0C for 24 h. The k = 5, 7, and 9 pellets were cooled slowly (6 \u00b0C/min), and the k = 3 pellets were air quenched because the phase is unstable below 1250 \u00b0C . The density of each pellet was determined by dividing the mass by the calculated volume. Phase purity of the sintered pellets was confirmed by X-ray diffraction with a Rigaku diffractometer (Rigaku, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using a Cu K\u03b1 source. A thin film of In2O3(ZnO)2 was deposited on an MgO substrate by RF magnetron sputtering using a 2-inch-diameter ceramic target. Sputtering was performed for 1 h under a mixture of 5% O2/95% Ar with a total pressure of 5 Pa and a gas flow rate of 20 sccm, using a power of 25 W, a target-to-substrate distance of 8.5 cm, and a substrate temperature of 600 \u00b0C. The film was transferred to the XPS measurement chamber without breaking vacuum. After XPS and UPS measurements were completed, the film structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction with a Rigaku ATX-G Thin Film Diffraction Workstation using an 18 kW Cu K\u03b1 source. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed using the Darmstadt Integrated System for Materials Research (DAISY-MAT, TU-Darmstadt, Germany) on a Physical Electronics PHI 5700 spectrometer (Physical Electronics, Chanhassen, MN) , which was connected by a high vacuum transfer apparatus to the RF sputtering chamber used for film deposition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 radiation source and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a helium (He\u2013I) gas discharge lamp with an excitation energy of 21.11 eV. The energy resolution, determined by Gaussian broadening of the Fermi edge of an Ag standard, was 400 meV for XPS and 200 meV for UPS. XPS and UPS measurements were first performed on the as-prepared pellets and film. To remove surface contamination on the pellets resulting from their exposure to air, the pellets were subsequently subjected to an oxidation anneal under 0.1\u20130.5 Pa O2 at 450\u2013500 \u00b0C until the carbon signal observed in XPS spectra was negligible (6 h total). The in situ film, which had not been exposed to air, was also annealed in oxygen (0.5 Pa O2) at 500 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. After these oxidation treatments, XPS and UPS measurements were repeated. The samples were. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "then annealed in a reducing environment (2 h at 500 \u00b0C under 10\u22125 Pa vacuum for the pellets, 1.5 h for the film) and XPS and UPS measurements were repeated again. The work function was measured under ambient conditions using a non-scanning Kelvin probe system (KP Technology, Inc., Wick, Scotland) with a 2-mm-diameter gold-coated probe head. The probe tip work function was calibrated before and after measurements using a gold standard. Prior to Kelvin probe measurement, thin film surfaces were cleaned using DI water, ethanol, acetone, and hexane. To minimize error from capacitive effects and water adsorption, the probe-sample distance was held constant and the room humidity was maintained below 45%. Samples were re-measured after a 10-min UV-ozone treatment.  XPS survey spectra were collected to check surface composition and verify that no unexpected elements were present. Fig. 2a shows the XPS spectrum of the reduced In2O3(ZnO)3 specimen, which was representative of all compounds measured and verifies that only In, Zn, and O were present. The In 3d and Zn 2p core level emissions are shown in detail in Fig. 2b and c, respectively. The carbon signal, present in all as-prepared bulk samples, was negligible after the oxidation treatment. Surface compositions of each sample were calculated based on the relative intensity of peaks from each element, and showed that the surface concentrations of all polycrystalline pellets were consistently In-rich. The cation ratio, [In]/([In] + [Zn]), initially showed a 15\u201320% In excess compared to the stoichiometric concentration. This excess decreased to 10\u201317% after the oxidation anneal, mostly likely owing to a removal of adsorbed hydrocarbons at the surface, which causes a stronger attenuation of the more surface-sensitive Zn 2p spectrum compared to the In 3d spectrum. The composition was essentially unchanged by the reduction anneal. The In excess suggests that In segregation or Zn depletion occurs at grain surfaces during sintering. It is also possible that in these randomly oriented polycrystalline pellets, In-rich surface orientations may be slightly more energetically favorable than Zn-rich surfaces. The In2O3(ZnO)2 film exhibited a slight Zn excess of 2% compared to stoichiometry. X-ray diffraction confirmed that the In2O3(ZnO)k bulk samples (k = 3, 5, 7, and 9) were phase pure, with no significant texturing observed. The thin film sample (k = 2) showed no amorphous signal, but the film was highly textured, with only (0 0 l) diffraction peaks present. In addition, some peaks corresponded to (0 0 l) planes of the k = 3 phase. The presence of a secondary phase may explain the slight Zn excess measured by XPS. The In-3d5/2 core level binding energy as a function of the Fermi level is presented in Fig. 3a. It can be seen that all the bulk In2O3(ZnO)k (k = 3, 5, 7, and 9) and the thin film (k = 2) data fall on approximately the same line. This line has a slope of one, corresponding to parallel shifts of the core level binding energy and the Fermi level owing to differences in carrier content. It is surprising that all the IZO specimens fell on this line regardless of structure and over such a wide range of composition. Compared to previous work on In2O3 and ITO , represented by the dashed line, the In core level binding energies are consistently higher in all samples measured in this experiment. This may be attributable to the presence of Zn in these compounds. Another significant difference is the lack of a decreased slope at high Fermi level like that observed in the core level binding energy of ITO, which was previously explained by the screening of core hole emissions by free electrons in the conduction band owing to a high degree of degeneracy . In ITO this was accompanied by metal-like emissions at the Fermi level in UPS spectra, which were not seen in our samples (see Fig. 2d). The same trend in binding energy is observed for the Zn-2p3/2 core level (Fig. 3b), which might also be expected to exhibit screening effects based on the strong contribution of Zn states to the conduction band . However, the asymmetry observed in many core level peaks, especially in reduced samples (see Fig. 2b and c) may represent plasmon satellite signals, which have been correlated to screening by conduction electrons . The work function (E vac\u2212E F) has been plotted vs. Fermi level (E F\u2212E VBM) for members of the In2O3(ZnO)k system in Fig. 4 . Thin film In2O3(ZnO)2 results are indicated by red X's and bulk, polycrystalline In2O3(ZnO)k results are shown as blue diamonds (k = 3), green circles (k = 5), orange squares (k = 7), and purple triangles (k = 9). The solid lines in these plots represent constant ionization potentials (the sum of the work function and Fermi level). A material whose ionization potential remains fixed will lie parallel to these lines, and any change in E F will be accompanied by an equal shift of the work function in the opposite direction. The data for each IZO phase indicate essentially constant ionization potentials, even after oxidation and reduction treatments. Furthermore, all phases measured share the same ionization potential of approximately 7.7 eV. This suggests that the ionization potential of the dominating surfaces in polycrystalline In2O3(ZnO)k are independent of their composition and cannot be changed by oxidation or reduction. To understand why this may be, it is helpful to compare the ionization potential of the IZO system with those of the basis oxides In2O3 (Fig. 4a) and ZnO (Fig. 4b), which have already been reported . In Fig. 4a, the work functions and Fermi levels of in situ thin films of In2O3 are represented by open diamonds, and those of sintered pellets and air-annealed films are represented by solid gray diamonds. The ionization potential of the IZO samples is similar to that of In2O3 films and pellets that were deposited or annealed in air, and the 7.7 eV line shown in the figure is the ionization potential recently associated with an oxygen dimer-stabilized In2O3 (1 0. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "0) surface . In contrast to the IZO samples, the ionization potential of thin film In2O3 samples can be altered by post-deposition oxidizing treatments. Results for ZnO are plotted in Fig. 4b as open circles (ZnO thin films) and gray circles (AZO thin films and bulk polycrystalline samples). In our previous work, it was noted that pure and doped ZnO samples tend to have constant ionization potentials, which are fixed during deposition and cannot be changed by post-deposition treatments . Similar behavior is observed in the IZO materials. In ZnO, this IP value depends on the surface orientation, with low ionization potentials (6.9 eV) associated with the polar Zn-terminated (0 0 0 1) surface and high values (7.8 eV) associated with the polar oxygen-terminated (0001\u00af) and the non-polar (101\u00af0) surfaces of ZnO . Bulk, polycrystalline ZnO and AZO pellets and films deposited under oxidizing conditions had ionization potentials closer to the 7.8 eV line, and similar behavior was found for all the IZO samples measured in the current experiment, which were either fabricated in air or deposited in situ under oxidizing conditions. Based upon the virtually identical ionization potentials of In2O3 and ZnO grown or treated under oxidizing conditions (7.7 vs. 7.8 eV), we cannot conclusively identify the origin of the constant (\u223c7.7\u20137.8 eV) ionization potentials of In2O3(ZnO)k phases grown under similar oxidizing conditions. The fact that post-deposition redox treatments of both the in situ grown and measured k = 2 thin film specimen and each of the bulk polycrystalline specimens in Fig. 4 result in Fermi level shifts, but at constant ionization potential, might argue in favor of ZnO-like behavior; however, this requires further investigation, preferably on epitaxial thin film surfaces. Nevertheless, the overarching conclusion from the present work is that the ionization potentials of In2O3(ZnO)k phases grown under oxidizing conditions are relatively independent of structure and composition. IZO specimens were also investigated under ambient conditions using the Kelvin probe method and the results are summarized in Fig. 5 . The work functions obtained for cleaned specimens were very similar to those of oxidized samples measured by UPS, which fell between 4.7 and 4.9 eV. A 10-min ozone treatment increased the work functions to 5.0\u20135.15 eV. These data taken under room temperature ambient conditions are of direct interest to organic photovoltaic and light-emitting diode applications. It is somewhat surprising that the work functions measured with the Kelvin probe agree so well with the UPS work functions. The Kelvin probe measurements in ambient conditions might be considered analogous to vacuum measurements of samples after an oxidizing heat treatment. However, work functions measured with the Kelvin probe tend to be higher than those from UPS even when both are measured in vacuum, and the adsorbed molecules covering a surface in atmosphere can alter the surface electronic characteristics significantly . Nevertheless, the similarity of the work functions of all the compounds measured, along with the similar ionization potentials measured by UPS, suggests that the surfaces behave similarly despite the significant changes in overall sample composition.  The surface electronic potentials have been measured for bulk and thin film specimens of compounds in the In2O3(ZnO)k system (k = 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9) via photoelectron spectroscopy. The In-3d5/2 core level binding energy for all samples measured fell on a constant line vs. Fermi level. The binding energy was slightly higher than that measured for In2O3 and ITO at a given Fermi level, which may be related to presence of Zn in the IZO samples. No electron screening was observed, indicating that none of the samples were highly degenerately doped. The work function and Fermi level as measured by UPS fall on a line of constant ionization potential (\u223c7.7\u20137.8 eV), independent of composition and unchanged by oxidation and reduction treatments. This ionization potential was similar to that previously determined for an oxygen-stabilized surface of In2O3 (\u223c7.7 eV) and was very close to that of oxygen-terminated and non-polar surfaces of ZnO (7.8 eV), which have been observed for In2O3 and ZnO samples, respectively, deposited or treated under similar conditions to the IZO samples in the current work. Further surface studies on epitaxial IZO thin films would be required to conclusively identify the origin of the observed constant ionization potential behavior. To determine how the work function differed when samples were exposed to atmosphere rather than vacuum, Kelvin probe measurements were performed under ambient conditions. The work function of cleaned specimens under atmosphere was similar to that observed for oxidized samples under vacuum (4.7\u20134.9 eV). This work function could be increased by ozone treatment to 5\u20135.15 eV. As with measurements taken under vacuum, the work function varied little from one IZO phase to another.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2018.10.242.txt", "paper": ["Since the invention of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) was firstly raised by O\u2019Regan and Gr\u00e4tzel in 1991 [1], the DSSC have been considered to be one of the most efficient solar cells owing to its low-cost [2], eco-friendly [3] and high performance [4]. Nowadays, DSSC is considered as a low-cost and eco-friendly harvesting solar energy, mainly composed of dye-sensitized porous photoanode, redox electrolyte and a counter electrode [5,6]. Photoanode is an important part of DSSC. However, most of photoanodes are prepared by TiO2 nanoparticles [7\u20139]. Unfortunately, electron transports through many grain boundaries before reaching the electrode and is easy to recombine with holes at the grain boundaries in TiO2 nanoparticles film [10\u201313]. In order to improve the performance of DSSC, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure photoanode has been synthesized to replace the nanoparticles film because it can provide a direct pathway effectively for collection of charges which is generated throughout the device, resulting in an improvement of the charge collection efficiency [14\u201316]. 1D TiO2 nanostructures [17], for instance nanofibers [18\u201322], nanotubes [23,24], nanorods [25,26] and nanowires [27,28], have been synthesized by opaque or transparent conducting substrates by various methods including anodization [29], hydrothermal or solvothermal synthesis [30,31] and electrospinning [32\u201334]. Submicron nanostructure, as the center of light scattering, is propitious to enhance light-harvesting [35,36]. 1D TiO2 nanostructures, as the photoanode materials in DSSC, have attracted much attention owing to its ordered structures, which are advantageous to electron transportation, and larger dimensions will help scattering of incident light and improve efficiency of light-harvesting. Kim et al. [37] reported that nanofibers were synthesized by electrospinning act as a photoanode of DSSC possessed the best efficiency, which was up to 5.02%. Thence, a number of attentions have been drawn to application of nanofibers in a photoanode of DSSC. Currently among the several studied methods for producing nanofibers (NF), electrospinning is considered to be the most productive, simple, effective and chemically controllable method [38]. Herein, we designed TiO2 NF by electrospinning, which were based on titanium, solvent and polymer precursor. At present, the research of dye-sensitized solar cell photoanode mainly focuses on improving dye adsorption, increasing the light scattering ability and harvest the light, reducing electron-hole recombination and improving the charge transfer ability [39\u201344]. In order to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSC, 1D nanofibers can be prepared, which can improve the electron transportation capacity and reduce the recombination of electrons and holes. In order to further improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency, a barrier layer can be prepared on the surface of TiO2 nanofibers photoanode to reduce the combination of electrons and holes [45,46]. The photoanode structure surface modification can possibly build a barrier at the photoanode/electrolyte interface to retard the electron transfer to the electrolyte [47]. Kim et al. [48] found that zirconium oxide was used as a post-treatment material for photoelectrodes in DSSC, and DSSC with higher energy conversion efficiency were developed. The Zr oxide-post-treatment was prepared by the following methods. Firstly, prepared photoelectrodes was dipped into the a 40-mM zirconium butoxide (Zr(OC4H3)4) solution of 1-butanol for 30\u202fmin at 70\u202f\u00b0C. Secondly, the samples were calcined for 30\u202fmin at 475\u202f\u00b0C. Insulating materials with higher conduction bands than TiO2, ZrO2 had been coated onto TiO2 photoanodes to enhance the performance of DSSC [49]. ZrO2 produced a barrier between electron and redox electrolyte, resulting in the decrease of recombination and suppress the activity of surface recombination sites [50\u201352,36]. In this work, we prepared NF film by electrospinning method and NF film was used as efficient photoanode material of DSSC. Moreover, in order to enhance the efficiency of DSSC, a simple synthesis route was used to scrape ZrO2 that acted as a barrier. EIS measurements provided evidence that the ZrO2 as a barrier reduced recombination losses at the electron-hole recombination interface between TiO2 and the dye/electrolyte. Therefore, DSSC based on the optimal NP/NF/ZrO2-based device could achieve a efficiency of 6.72%, which was higher than the conventional NP/NF-based device with efficiency of 6.14%. This work provides an important approach for the rational design of the photoanodes in DSSC, which also implies the application of this structure in other type of solar cells.  TiO2/PVP composite nanofibers were firstly collected on Al foil that was calcinated at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in air. The precursor solution contained 10\u202fg titanium isopropoxide (TiP), 4\u202fg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 20\u202fmL acetic acid and 70\u202fmL ethanol were subjected to magnetic stirring for 4\u202fh prior to electrospin at 70\u202f\u00b0C. The voltage of 10\u202fkV was applied over a collector distance of 10\u202fcm. The electrospinning TiO2 nanofibers films were kept in air for about 24\u202fh prior to sintering in order to remove the solvent. TiO2/PVP composite nanofibers sintering process was 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin with 1\u202f\u00b0C\u2219min\u22121 in air. A layer of TiO2 nanofibers films were peeled off from the Al foil after calcination and then transferred to FTO glass (2.0\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.5\u202fcm, 14.0\u202f\u03a9\u2219cm\u22121) with commercial TiO2 paste. TiO2 nanoparticles/TiO2 nanofibers (NP/NF) films were calcinated 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in air, zirconium dioxide layer was prepared using the scratch coating method, then NP/NF/ZrO2 films were calcinated 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in the air, finally the NP/NF/ZrO2 was obtained. Preparation of working electrodes: The 365\u202f\u03bcL bis (pentane-2,4-dionato-O,O') bis (propan-2-olato) titanium was dissolved in 5\u202fmL ethanol solution. A dense layer as a blocking layer was prepared on the FTO glass by spinning coating for 3 times at 3000\u202frpm/min. Then it was calcined at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in air. The photoanode was developed by pasting the nanofibers films onto FTO glass through scratch coating method. The monolayer TiO2 nanofibers films were peeled off from the Al foil after calcination and then transferred to FTO glass (2.0\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.5\u202fcm, 14.0\u202f\u03a9\u202fcm\u22121) with an ultrathin commercial TiO2 nanoparticles layer which functioned both as a hole-blocking and bonding layer. TiO2 nanoparticles/TiO2 nanofibers (NP/NF) films were calcinated 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in air, eventually we got the NP/NF photoanode. ZrO2 was pasted on NP/NF photoanode and it was calcinated 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in air. Eventually, we got the NP/NF/ZrO2 photoanode. The effective area was 0.16\u202fcm2. The solar cells were soaked for 48\u202fh in photosensitizer solution. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "(0.5\u202fmM ruthenium-based N719 dye ethanol solution at 25\u202f\u00b0C). The solar cell was assembled in Pt-coated FTO counter electrode and electrolyte (0.3\u202fM LiI, 0.05\u202fM I2, 0.6\u202fM 1-proply-3-methylimidazolium iodide and 0.5\u202fM tert-Butylpyridine in dry acetonitrile). Electrospinning process and the images of nanofibers were shown in Fig. 1 . The crystalline phases of the NP/NF-based device and NP/NF/ZrO2-based device was analyzed by using a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance. The surface elements of the material were obtained by XPS analysis. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JEM 6510LV and Sigma 500) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20) were used to study the morphology of the nanofibers and the cross section of NP/NF-based device and NP/NF/ZrO2-based. Using a solar simulator (Oriel, model 91192-1000) and a source meter (Keithley 2400, USA) under simulated Air Mass (AM) 1.5G (100\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122 irradiance) could obtain the current density-voltage (J-V) curves of the devices. EIS was characterized by using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, IM6, Germany) over the frequency range of 10\u20130.1\u202fMHz under simulated Air Mass (AM) 1.5\u202fG (mW\u202fcm\u22122 irradiance). The dye loading was desorbed in 5\u202fmL 0.1\u202fM NaOH ethanol-water (ethanol:deionized water\u202f=\u202f1:1) solution, and then the dye loading was determined by UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan).  XRD is considered to be one of the best methods to investigate the crystallinity and chemistry of nanoparticles. Fig. 2 displayed the XRD patterns of TiO2 nanoparticles/nanofibers (NP/NF) and TiO2 nanoparticles/nanofibers/ZrO2 (NP/NF/ZrO2). As shown in Fig. 2, the featured diffraction peak of NP/NF appeared at (1\u202f0\u202f1), (0\u202f0\u202f4) and (0\u202f0\u202f2), which assigned to the 25.18\u00b0, 37.15\u00b0 and 48.13\u00b0 lattice planes of TiO2 materials, respectively. Especially, the narrow and strong peaks at 2\u03b8\u202f=\u202f25.18\u00b0 and 37.15\u00b0 indicated the superior degree of anatase TiO2. From the Bragg equation, the lattice spacing was about 0.357\u202fnm which was conformed to the TEM results. The XRD patterns for NP/NF/ZrO2 (anatase TiO2 [JCPDS: 21-1272] and baddeleyite ZrO2 [JCPDS: 37\u20131484]) showed that the featured diffraction peak of ZrO2 appeared at (\u202f\u22121\u202f1\u202f1), (1\u202f1\u202f1) and (2\u202f0\u202f0), which assigned to the 28.19\u00b0, 31.50\u00b0and 34.21\u00b0 lattice planes of ZrO2 materials, respectively. Particularly, the narrow and strong peaks at 2\u03b8\u202f=\u202f28.19\u00b0 and 31.50\u00b0 indicated the superior degree of baddeleyite ZrO2. According to the Bragg equation, the lattice spacing was about 0.286\u202fnm which was conformed to the TEM results. The XRD measurements showed that NP/NF and NP/NF/ZrO2 included TiO2 and ZrO2. To investigate the chemical element of nanofibers, XPS measurements were conducted, as shown in Fig. 3 . XPS of NP/NF and NP/NF/ZrO2 showed clearly that the peak was in the regions of the expected chemical element: Ti, O and Zr. The XPS spectrum of NP/NF and NP/NF/ZrO2 showed three visible peaks corresponding to 2p of Ti, 1s of O and 3d of Zr peaks with binding energies at 459, 532.14 and 182.07\u202feV, respectively. Ti 2p region also has two peaks at 459.44 and 465.09\u202feV. One of peaks located at 465.09\u202feV corresponding to the 2P1/2 of Ti and another peak at 459.44\u202feV could be assigned to 2P3/2 of Ti. The splitting peak between 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 of Ti was 5.65\u202feV, indicating that the Ti was present as Ti (IV) in the synthesized nanofibers. The prepared NP/NF/ZrO2 exhibited a main crystalline phase with the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Zr peaks at 184.78 and 182.41\u202feV, indicating that zirconium was present in Fig. 3(d). The lattice oxygen in the Ti-O-Ti bonds has a peak at 530.67\u202feV. The lattice oxygen in the Zr-OH bonds appears at 532.63\u202feV. As a result of XPS measurements of NP/NF/ZrO2, it could be invoked as another proof about the chemistry content of the NP/NF/ZrO2. In order to further investigate the nanofibers, FESEM-mapping was used. Figs. 4 and 5 showed the chemical mapping of the elements appeared. From the Fig. 4, there were existence of Ti and O elements on the prepared TiO2/NF and the crossing of photoanode. As shown in Fig. 5, there were existence of Ti, O and Zr elements on the prepared materials and the crossing of the photoanode. The combination of Figs. 4 and 5 showed that zirconium dioxide is mainly distributed on the surface of the photoanode, and a small portion penetrates further on the surface of the nanofibers. In a few words, the morphology and chemistry were further affirmed by FESEM and chemical mapping, which clarified that the preparation of the crossing of photoanode was TiO2/ZrO2. On the basis of above characterization, in order to further prove the presence of ZrO2 on the surface of TiO2 nanofibers, the nanofibers were evaluated by TEM, HRTEM and mapping. It could be seen that the nanofibers were uniformly distributed with some nanoparticles attached to their surfaces, as shown in Fig. 6 . The crystal planes of TiO2 and ZrO2 was showed in Fig. 6. What\u2019s more, the chemical mapping further emphasized that ZrO2 was attached to the surface of TiO2 nanofibers. Moreover, Fig. 6(d) showed the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the nanofibers. The polycrystalline diffraction rings confirmed that the nanofibers samples were the anatase phase, as similar results of XRD. In addition, some photoelectric properties of NP/NF-based device and NP/NF/ZrO2-based device were firstly investigated. The structure of NP/NF-based device and NP/NF/ZrO2-based device were showed in Fig. 8 (a). As shown in Fig. 7(a) and summarized in Table 1 , the NP/NF-based device achieved V oc of 0.725\u202fV, a short-circuit current density (J sc) of 12.25\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, PCE of 6.14% and fill factor (FF) of 69.13%. In contrast to the NP/NF, the device fabricated with NP/NF/ZrO2 performed significantly better, which exhibited V oc of 0.774\u202fV, J sc of 14.03\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122, PCE of 6.72% and FF of 61.93%. As seen from Table 1, there were slightly enhancements of short-circuit current density and PCE in NP/NF/ZrO2 due to a barrier with ZrO2. Moreover, NP/NF/ZrO2-based device exhibited higher efficiency when compared to that of NP/NF-based device, indicating that the ZrO2 as a barrier can significantly reduce electron-hole recombination between TiO2 and the dye/electrolyte. In order to further investigate the efficiency of the solar cells, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE, 350\u2013800\u202fnm, ZAHNER PP211, Germany) and dye loading was. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "measured. The IPCE spectrum of a representative NP/NF/ZrO2 composite device was presented in Fig. 7(c). The device with NP/NF/ZrO2 exhibited a maximum IPCE value closing to 40% at 524\u202fnm, while the device with NP/NF reached only 31.49%. The NP/NF/ZrO2 composite was correlated with a much higher Jsc values. In order to analyze the difference between the J sc values, action spectra of the IPCE as a function of incident wavelength of NP/NF-based device and NP/NF/ZrO2-based device were recorded. The IPCE values of NP/NF/ZrO2-based device exceeded its maximum values, which was much higher than the IPCE values for the NP/NF-based device in Fig. 7(c). It was not surprise that the NP/NF/ZrO2-based device microspheres with an enlarged IPCE integral provided a much higher J sc value than that of NP/NF-based device. Notably, the loading capacity of commercial dye N719 for NP/NF/ZrO2-based device was about 1.17\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127\u202fmol\u202fcm\u22122, which was almost same as that of NP/NF-based device (1.13\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127\u202fmol\u202fcm\u22122) and probably explained different IPCE response and photocurrent-voltage. Furthermore, it explained why ZrO2 significantly reduced electron-hole recombination between TiO2 and the dye/electrolyte, respectively. EIS is an effective techniques to evaluate the charge transfer resistance of photoanode in DSSC. The measurements of prepared materials were displayed in Fig. 7(b). Fig. 7(b) showed Nyquist plots of the NP/NF-based device and NP/NF/ZrO2-based device. Fig. 7(b) showed that two semicircles were in the Nyquist plots. The small semicircle located in the high frequency region, which was the resistance of the Pt electrode/electrolyte interface (R2). The large semicircle located in the low frequency region, which was the resistance of the electrolyte/TiO2 interface (R3). On the basis of the fitted data, Table 1 showed the resistance and other parameters of the electrical circuit. The charge transfer resistance of the NP/NF/ZrO2-based device photoanode (R3) was 76.7\u202f\u03a9, which was less than the NP/NF-based device photoanode (106.3\u202f\u03a9). As all of known, NP/NF/ZrO2-based device had lower R3, which caused by the faster redox reaction of I3 \u2212/I\u2212 pairs at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface [48]. In NP/NF/ZrO2-based devices, electron transportation from electrolyte to dye became faster, suggesting that charge effectively injected into the photoanode and transferred to the external circuit, thus reducing electron-hole recombination. It turned out to be the case that ZrO2 as a barrier could enhance the efficient. The impedance of the DSSC also approved ZrO2 as a barrier in the resistance of the photoanode DSSC. Fig. 8(a and b) showed the schematic overview of a dye-sensitized solar cell and schematic representation of energy levels and electronic transition were obtained. Compared with the device of NP/NF, the loading capacity of commercial dye for NP/NF/ZrO2 was unchanged. It was evidenced that the ZrO2 as a barrier reduced recombination losses at the electron-hole recombination interface between TiO2 and the dye/electrolyte and passivated localized surface states. It was further proved that the efficiency of dye adsorption was not affected, which was in good accordance with IPCE, EIS and J-V.  In this paper, we successfully prepared NF film by electrospinning method and NF film was used as efficient photoanode material of DSSC. ZrO2 demonstrated that ZrO2 as a barrier reduced recombination losses at the electron-hole recombination interface between TiO2 and the dye/electrolyte. The NP/NF/ZrO2-based device (6.72%) exhibited a superior PCE over that of the NP/NF-based device (6.14%). Therefore, as a new post-processing material, ZrO2 reduced interface resistance in DSSC.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

On the other hand, the demand for polysilicon, which is used in photovoltaic as the starting material for monocrystalline and multicrystalline wafers, has drastically increased in recent years . The production of silicon wafers starts with the manufacture of cylindrical crystal ingots by such widely known melt growth processes as the float zone and Czochralski techniques. These ingots are sliced into hundreds of thin crystal wafers, which are used in most solar cell fabrication. In large-scale production facilities, it is difficult to produce thin wafers from ingots without wasting 30\u201350% of the materials as kerf loss during the slicing process . Alternative methods such as EFG and string ribbon silicon can bring down the substrate cost by reducing feedstock consumption and eliminating mechanical sawing step, deep surface damage etching, and kerf loss since the substrates are grown directly in the form of ribbon from a silicon melt in the required thickness . Because of direct contact with the die and the thermal stresses involved in the process, substrate materials made by this method have a high density of crystalline defects and relatively high concentrations of impurities; these defects and impurities reduce the minority carrier lifetime in the as-grown material to typically less than 3 \u03bcs, which is not sufficient for high-efficiency cells . If the conversion efficiency of solar cells is to be increased, it will be necessary to improve the minority carrier lifetime by optimizing the process conditions for solar cell fabrication. In this study, we have used silicon surface texturing, phosphorus diffusion for p\u2013n junction formation, wet etching for PSG removal and edge isolation, antireflection coating with front surface passivation, and metallization to develop a low cost and highly efficient production technology.  Using a very simple n+\u2013p\u2013p+ cell structure, we fabricated solar cells with screen-printed contacts on boron-doped p-type EFG silicon (Wacker Schott Solar) with a thickness of 300 \u03bcm, resistivities of 2\u20134 \u03a9 cm, and a size of 125 mm \u00d7 125 mm. The EFG silicon wafers were ultrasonically cleaned, using 3 wt% HCl and deionized (DI) water in the ratio 1:10, at 23 \u00b0C for 5 min to remove surface contamination. The surface was textured by a treatment in HF:HNO3:DI water (3:3:3) at 26 \u00b0C for a maximum of 4 min. After texturing, the wafers were removed from the texturing bath and completely immersed in DI water flow to stop the reaction, after which they were thoroughly rinsed and dried by a spinning method. Textured p-type silicon wafers were diffused by using a conventional POCl3 liquid source at 830 \u00b0C for 7 min pre-deposition followed by drive-in at 860 \u00b0C for between 20 and 90 min. Phosphosilicate glass (PSG) was removed using a 5% HF solution. The sheet resistance of the n+ emitter layer was 31\u201352 \u03a9/sq. To prevent any possibility of short circuiting the p\u2013n junction at the periphery, we etched the edge by using a solution of HF, HNO3 and CH3COOH. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor with a plasma frequency of 13.56 MHz was used to deposit a SiNx:H film of thickness 73 \u00b1 1 nm and a refractive index of 2.24. A screen printing metallization technique was used for high-throughput metal contact formation using aluminum (Al) paste for the back surface and silver (Ag) paste on the front surface. These metal pastes were dried at 150 \u00b0C for 5 min. After being printed on both sides with the appropriate metals and then baked, the wafers were subjected to a co-firing cycle in an IR lamp-heated belt furnace for a high-temperature sintering in order to form proper ohmic contacts on the two sides. The textured surface was then analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The sheet resistance was measured by a four-point probe (Sinton four-point probe system). The diffuse reflection of the silicon surface was examined by a UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer (SCINCOS\u20132100) using an integrating sphere in the wavelength range of 300\u20131100 nm. Illuminated current\u2013voltage (LIV) characteristics and the performance parameters of the solar cells fabricated by the SiNx:H film using optimized properties were determined under one sun global solar spectrum of air mass 1.5 at 25 \u00b0C.  Because EFG silicon material has grains with a preferential {1 1 0} orientation, it is difficult to form the surface structure for decreasing the reflectance using the typical KOH or NaOH solutions . Therefore, we perform the surface texture with a mixed acid (HF, HNO3, DI water) solution that is used for creating a uniform surface texture as well as for dislocation or stain etching. Chemical oxidation with an HNO3 solution injects holes into the silicon that may attack the silicon lattice in a way that is similar to electrochemical dissolution. The holes oxidize the silicon, which is then removed by reaction with the HF solution. The production of the nitrogen oxide gas by silicon dissolution in the HF:HNO3 mixture is described by the following equation: 3Si + 4HNO3 + 18HF \u2192 3H2SiF6 + 4NO\u2191 + 8H2O During the etching process, the HF and HNO3 concentrations decrease gradually, while the H2SiF6 becomes enriched in the etching solution. Because of the growing concentration of water and H2SiF6 in the etching solution, the etching behavior changes significantly. As shown in Fig. 1 , as the etching time increases, the reflectance rapidly decreases from 28.6% to 15.1% for a sample with an etch rate from 24.2 to 167.5 nm/s. The results indicate that increasing the etching time has an effect on the reflectance for light trapping but induces a high etch rate. The carrier lifetime ranges from 1.05 to 1.41 \u03bcs, and it improved significantly after an etching of 90 s and increased slightly after etching that lasted from 120 to 240 s. As a result of the carrier lifetime, the surface texture created by acid chemical etching has improved defects and impurities which act as recombination sites. Fig. 2 shows SEM micrographs of the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "EFG silicon surface textured for (a) 30 s, (b) 90 s, (c) 150 s and (d) 240 s. The non-uniform holes are formed with size from 1 to 10 \u03bcm. The trend of average reflectance as a function of etching time, as shown in Fig. 1, is similar to trend of hole depth variation as etching time is varied. Also, the defects, which are stacking faults parallel to the growth direction and shaped ripples, were found on the EFG silicon surface. These defects were removed somewhat by increasing the etching time. However, because the hole size increases as the etching time increases, the high contact resistance between the metal electrode and emitter leads to an increase in the series resistance of solar cells. In order to optimize the sheet resistance, junction depth, and carrier lifetime for large-area commercial EFG silicon solar cells and learn to produce cells at low cost and with high efficiency, we varied the process time, temperature, and gases flow rates and studied them extensively. The pre-deposition processes in the range of between 20 and 130 \u03a9/sq were performed by varying the temperature from 810 to 880 \u00b0C for 7 min with the fixed gas flow rates. The sheet resistance decreased with exponential function, which dopant profile is characterized by a shallow junction depth and a high surface concentration. The junction depth is defined as the depth at which the phosphorus and boron concentrations are equal. For any impurity diffusion process, the junction depth generally increases while the surface concentration decreases with time. To achieve a deeper junction that provides greater insurance against junction penetration by the top metallization, drive-ins were carried out by varying the process time from 20 to 90 min at 860 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 3 , increasing the drive-in time led to decreases in the sheet resistance and the carrier lifetime. Commercial silicon solar cells made for terrestrial applications require a high dopant concentration for the screen-printed silver paste metallization by which the front contacts are normally made. In this study, therefore, we carried out the phosphorus diffusion for the p\u2013n junction formation by varying the sheet resistance from 31 to 52 \u03a9/sq. Hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx:H) films have been shown to combine outstanding surface passivation quality with excellent antireflection properties that make them suitable for solar cell fabrication . In our study, by varying the gas ratio (R = NH3/SiH4 + NH3) and deposition temperature during deposition, we obtained SiNx:H films of refractive indices 1.85\u20132.45. Among these, the SiNx:H film deposited with a gas ratio of 0.57 had the highest value of carrier lifetime. In the silicon rich (R \u2264 0.5) and nitrogen rich (R \u2265 0.64) regime, the carrier lifetime decreased because of the insufficient surface passivation effects of silicon wafer. Also, the deposition rate decreased from 14.1 to 9.7 nm/min, but the refractive index of the SiNx:H films increased from 1.92 to 2.24 as the deposition temperature increased from 150 to 450 \u00b0C. Fig. 4 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of solar cells fabricated from EFG and conventional monocrystalline silicon, which is fabricated by same process condition. In all range of wavelengths, the EQE of the EFG silicon solar cells was lower than that of monocrystalline silicon solar cell. This result indicates that an EFG silicon solar cell exhibits a loss of surface recombination at short wavelengths and light absorption at long wavelengths for improvement of optical and electrical properties. Fig. 5 and Table 1 show the electrical performance parameters of the EFG silicon solar cells as the sheet resistance is varied. The LIV measurements were carried out under a global solar spectrum of 1 Sun of AM 1.5 at 25 \u00b0C. Because of the low doping used for high sheet resistance, the open circuit voltage (V oc) decreased from 590 to 584 mV but the short circuit current density (J sc) increased from 28.4 to 32.1 mA/cm2 in the range of 31\u201352 \u03a9/sq. The conversion efficiency was improved significantly from 9.7% to 14.5% with an increase in the fill factor from 58% to 77.3%. This result underlines the fact that the high doping concentration for high open circuit voltage increases the surface recombination velocity and decreases the carrier lifetime because of the scattering effect caused by excessive dopants. As the sheet resistance increases, the open circuit voltage decreases with the decrease in dopant concentration of the emitter. In addition, the short circuit current density increases due to improvement of the short wavelength response and reduction of recombination in the front surface . Therefore, further improvement in EFG silicon solar cell performance is possible though the optimum parameters for cell fabrication.  Because it allows the efficient use of Si feedstock, EFG silicon has the potential to reduce solar cell costs. However, it is difficult to increase the conversion efficiency of this material because of the high density of crystalline defects and the high concentration of impurities, which decrease the carrier lifetime. Therefore, we have studied the EFG solar cell processes in order to improve the light trapping at the silicon surface and increase the carrier lifetime by decreasing the surface recombination velocity. With this optimized process, we have obtained values for the conversion efficiency, fill factor, current density, and open circuit voltage as high as 14.5%, 77.3, 32.1 mA/cm2, and 584 mV, respectively. Thus, the EFG silicon solar cells fabrication method described in this study may lead to a low cost and highly efficient production technology with sustainable process improvement.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

With more than 9 GWp installed in 2011, the Italian photovoltaic market is currently the biggest one worldwide. In 2011, more than 5% of the national electricity consumption has been satisfied by means of photovoltaic energy production [3]. The Italian experience confirms that photovoltaic plants can play an important role in the electricity market and that it will be a key energy production system in the near future. As described by the IEA PV Power Systems (PVPS) Task 2 [4], module soiling can result from various mechanisms such as pollution, accumulation of dust or pollen, bird droppings or growth of lichen (particularly at the lower edge of framed modules). Several studies have been carried out to estimate soiling losses in photovoltaic systems [5\u201311]. Garcia et al. [12] showed how modification in the incidence angle due to dust accumulation, impacts energy losses. This confirms the earlier findings of Hammond et al. [5] where the soiling losses were estimated to be in the range [2.3\u20137.7%] and are a function of the angle of incidence. Thevenard and Pelland [13] estimated the uncertainty in long term PV yield prediction due to soiling which was calculated to be 2%, while recently Riley and Littmann [14] have been shown that soiling losses can reach 11.5% in agricultural areas. Qasem et al. [15], demonstrated that the effect of dust on photovoltaic modules depends on concentration and spectral transmittance. In a recent study in Cyprus [16,17] dust effects were investigated with attention to the sand carried over the sea from the Sahara desert and found that cleaning of the PV modules is necessary immediately after such a sand episode which usually ends with light rain which sticks the sand on the PV\u2019s surface. It has been demonstrated that dirt and soiling strongly depend on the site location and climate [8], and the percentage reduction is difficult to be modeled or evaluated from case studies. Therefore, real PV plants performance monitoring is a better approach [18]. Moreover, the accumulation of dirt on solar panels (soiling) can have a significant impact on the PV system performance, and much of the information available is applicable only to the specific location in which the testing was conducted [6]. For these reasons a polynomial regression approach has been used in [8] and it is of great importance to investigate those results with the ones obtained with other methods. The method given by Drews et al. [19] can be used when a monitoring system is not available and gives an indication of the so called \u201cdiffuse losses\u201d that are a function of the soiling losses. Marion et al. [20] described the different performance evaluation methods for grid-connected photovoltaic systems. These concern the performance ratio, the system yield and the PVUSA method. The performance ratio quantifies the overall effect of losses and thus cannot be used for determining the effect of soiling. The same for the system yield as this is introduced as a convenient way to compare the energy produced by systems with a different nominal power. Finally, the PVUSA method is certainly useful to calculate the soiling losses but cannot be used in this study as the wind speed is not available. In order to calculate the effect of soiling on plants behavior, the idea in this study is to calculate the power produced at Standard Test Conditions (STCs \u2013 irradiance: 1000 W/m2; cell temperature: 25 \u00b0C; solar spectrum: AM 1.5) by the system under study before and after a clean-up of their photovoltaic modules. The percentage difference between these two power values represents the losses due to the soiling effect. Several methods are presented in literature to determine the power produced by a photovoltaic cell, module, or system. Physical models such as the one or two diodes models [21] are not easy to apply in the evaluation of the soiling effect as they require several parameters that are not always provided by the manufacturer of the system components, and they may not provide accurate results if a Large Scale Photovoltaic (LSPV) system is made of different PV module classes. Additionally, simple models such as the one discussed by Rahman and Yamashiro [22] use as an input the solar irradiance neglecting the effect of temperature and thus are not as accurate as needed. Since, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques represent a very good option where large databases of monitored data are available and with only a few information regarding the system are known [23], this type of model has been used for the comparison with the results obtained in [8]. This choice should also be intentional as polynomial models can have some limitations with respect to advanced algorithms used in ANNs such as the Bayesian regularization, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization [24], fuzzy logic [25] and other. Moreover, ANN-based models allow the overcome of deficiencies of conventional analytical techniques or numerical approaches [26]. Due to its generalization capability over other classical ANNs, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have been used for the development of the models utilized in the calculation of the soiling losses presented in this study [27,28]. Four BNN models have been developed in order to calculate the power at STC of two couples of photovoltaic strings forming two different photovoltaic fields before and after a complete clean-up of their modules. The present paper is organized as follows: the following section is dedicated to the description of the two photovoltaic plants and of the collected datasets. Section 3 is on the multilayer perceptron and Bayesian neural network regularization; while in Section 4 the developed BNN models and results are presented. Finally, Section 5 gives conclusions on this work and perspectives for the future.  In order to show the effectiveness of the method employed at different conditions, the performance of two identical solar plants built at different locations in the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "countryside of Southern Italy have been studied. Both plants are located 100 km from Bari, longitude 41\u00b07\u20321\u2032\u2032, latitude 16\u00b052\u203218\u2032\u2032. The different conditions are related to the fact that a first plant is installed in a sandy site, while the second in a green one. The nominal power of the two solar plants is 1 MWp, the nominal AC voltage is 20 kV, and the utilized conversion is of the centralized type (i.e., the photovoltaic fields are divided into two subfields connected to two inverters). A schematic block diagram of the photovoltaic plants considered is depicted in Fig. 2a whereas a photograph of the second plant is shown in Fig. 2b . The strings are made of 20 series of connected PV modules, while groups of 16 strings are connected in parallel into 16 DC boards where fuses prevent over current into the strings [8]. The PV modules employed are produced by Q. Cells multi-crystalline silicon model QC-C04, whose electrical data are reported in Table 1a . The electrical parameters of a typical string made of 20 number 220 Wp power class modules are reported in Table 1b . The two plants are equipped with two identical monitoring systems produced by Skytron\u00ae [29]. The monitoring systems consist of: A monocrystalline silicon solar cell Skytron\u00ae SOZ-3 for the measure of the on-plane solar irradiance (precision is \u00b15% in annual mean compared with a WMO class-1 pyranometer). Cell temperature contact probes, type Pt1000 (precision is \u00b10.8% at 100 \u00b0C). A number of channels for the measurement of the DC current (precision is \u00b12%). One channel for the measurement of the DC voltage (precision is \u00b15%). One data logger type SkyLog\u00ae that collects the electrical and climate data from the field. One server type SkyServ\u00ae connected to the web. In order to determine the PV plant behavior at STC, two datasets \u2013 one from soiled modules and the second from cleaned modules \u2013 of electrical and climate data (in-plane irradiance and cell temperature) have been collected for each plant. The spectral properties have not been measured and thus have not been considered in this study. However, as the geometrical conditions (latitude, tilt and azimuth angles) are the same both for dirty and cleaned modules and as the observation periods are rather long (7 weeks each), the spectral properties can be assumed to be constant. In any case this information is inherently included in the data measured as these concern actual data from an actual plant. The PV modules have been operating for approximately 1 year before any cleaning was performed. The first acquisition period was June 21st\u2013August 30th 2010, while the second one is September 2nd\u2013October 24th 2010; the sample frequency is 15 min. The following parameters have been measured for each plant: The current produced by the two couples of parallel connected PV strings, I DC. The DC bus voltage, V DC. The cell temperature, Tc. The in-plane solar irradiance, Gi. Fig. 3 shows an example of the monitored data (Gi, Tc) and the power output (P DC) for a couple of PV strings calculated as the product of the measured current (I DC) and voltage (V DC).  The most commonly used neural network is the multilayer perceptron (feed-forward neural network). This type of ANN has been used successfully in several applications, including photovoltaic research studies, as reported in [25]. The ANN employed is a loop-free network which has its units arranged in layers, with only one input unit connected to the units in the next layer of the sequence. The first layer comprises a fixed input unit; there may be several layers of trainable \u2018hidden units\u2019 carrying an internal activation function, and finally, there is the output unit layer which is also trainable. Given the input and related output datasets it is possible to train the network by means of a supervised learning technique, generally known as back-propagation (BP) that allows adapting the unit weights. These changes are based on the differences between the known output (part of training dataset) and the one calculated by the ANN. In order to train the neural network fast, the following algorithms have been developed over the years: conjugate gradient (CG), Quasi-Newton (QN), Levenberg\u2013Marquardt (LM) and Variable Learning Rate Back-Propagation (VLRBP). One of the problems that occur during neural network training is known as over-fitting in which the error on the given training data set is driven to a very small value, but when new training data are presented to the network, the output presents a non negligible error. This means that the network has memorized the training examples leading to a small error, but it has not learned to generalize to new situations. Bayesian regularization can greatly improve neural network\u2019s generalization ability [27]. The process of a Bayesian regularization consists in updating the weight and bias values according to Levenberg\u2013Marquardt optimization technique. This minimizes a combination of squared errors and weights and determines the correct combination so as to produce a network that generalizes well. Bayesian NNs are mainly BP networks with an additional ridge parameter added to the objective function. A brief description of the Bayesian inference method is as follows. In the Bayesian framework, the neural learning process is assigned to a probabilistic interpretation. The regularized objective function is given by: S=\u03b2Ee+\u03b1Ew where: Ee(e)=12\u2211i=1n(ei)2=12\u2211i=1n(yi-y\u0303i)2 Ew(w)=12\u2211i=1nwi2 while y and y\u0303 are the actual output and the calculated output respectively; n is the total number of parameters/samples in the network; and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are termed hyper-parameters (regularization parameter). During training, the objective is to maximize the posterior distribution over the weights w, to obtain the most probable parameter values. The posterior distribution is then used to evaluate the predictions of the trained network for new values of the input variables. For a particular network A, trained to fit a dataset D={xi,ti}i=1N by minimizing an error function S given by Eq. (1), Bayes\u2019 theorem can be used in order to estimate the posterior probability distribution p(w|D,\u03b1,\u03b2,A) for the weights as follows [27]: p(w|D,\u03b1,\u03b2,A)=p(D|w,\u03b2,A)p(w|\u03b1,A)p(D|\u03b1,\u03b2,A) where. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "p(w|\u03b1,A) is the prior density representative of the knowledge of the weights before any data is observed p(D|w,\u03b2,A). This is the likelihood function that represents a model for the noise process on the target data. The factor p(D|\u03b1,\u03b2,A) is known as the evidence and is the normalization factor which guarantees that the total probability is 1, given by: p(D|\u03b1,\u03b2,A)=\u222bp(D|w,\u03b2,A)p(w,\u03b1,A) In order to evaluate the posterior distribution, the expressions for the prior distribution and the likelihood function must be defined [27]. The well-known Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm (LM) has been employed in order to minimize the objective function given in Eq. (1). The BNNs have been chosen for following reasons [30]: They are difficult to over-train, as an evidence procedure provide an objective criterion for stopping, training and removing the need for a separate validation set to detect the onset of over-training. They are difficult to over-fit, because they calculate and train the effective number of parameters. This is considerably smaller than the number of weights and bias in a standard BP network. They are inherently insensitive to the architecture of the network as long as a minimal number of hidden neurons is employed. A large database is not necessary.  The following pre-processing, which makes the network more efficient, has been carried out on the four available datasets: y=ymin+(x-xmin)(xmax-xmin)-1(ymax-ymin) where x\u03b5 [x min \u2212 x max] is the original data value, and y\u03b5 [y min \u2212 y max] is the corresponding normalized variable, while y min and y max have been set to \u22121 and 1 respectively. Finally, for each PV plant and period a set of 4800 samples has been divided into three subsets: 70% of the samples of the total set have been used for the training of the BNNs, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation. A schematic block diagram of the BNNs used for the calculation of the STC power is depicted in Fig. 4a . The employed BNNs have three layers: an input layer, a single hidden layer, and an output layer. The first layer has two inputs (the solar irradiance and the cell temperature), while the output layer consists of a single output node that represents the power produced by the PV plant. The number of units in the hidden layer is estimated during the training process. The model used by Massi Pavan et al. [8] for the calculation of the power produced at STC by the PV plant before and after the cleaning of their modules is the one proposed by Mayer et al. [31]: P=a+b\u00b7Tc\u00b7Gi+c\u00b7Gi+d\u00b7Gi2 where Tc is the cell temperature, Gi the in-plane solar irradiance, a, b, c, and d are polynomial coefficients. The LM algorithm is used for the calibration of the models, and the polynomial coefficients found \u2013 reported in Appendix A \u2013 are then used for the calculation of the STC power by imposing a cell temperature of 25 \u00b0C and a solar irradiance of 1000 W/m2. For each plant, a first dataset corresponding to 4 weeks of operation before the cleanup of their PV modules has been used to train the BNNs with the use of a soft computing program developed under MatLab\u00a9 (Ver. 7.8, 2009). The same procedure has then been applied to a second dataset corresponding to 4 weeks of operations after the clean-up has been performed. Different architectures of BNNs have been evaluated, and the best one has been chosen consisting of two units in the input layer, two in the hidden one, and one in the output layer as shown in Fig. 4b . Experimental investigations show that, even if the number of hidden units is increased the result does not change significantly, so this architecture is adopted due to its simplicity and accuracy. The log-sigmoid function has been employed and thus the produced power can be written as: P\u223c(Gi,Tc)=w12c1+w22c2+b12 where: c1=11+exp-w1,11Gi+w1,21Tc+b11 c2=11+exp-w2,11Gi+w2,21Tc+b21 The calculated weights (w) and bias (b) for the two PV plants under study before and after the clean-up are reported in Appendix A. The comparisons between the produced and calculated power reported in Fig. 5 shows a very good performance of the designed BNNs; the mean correlation coefficient for the four cases is in fact greater than 0.99. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed BNN and polynomial models, three statistical errors have been calculated (the formulas are given is Appendix B): The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results are shown in Table 2 and these confirm that the developed BNNs perform better with the data collected before the cleaning of the plants. This is due to the seasonal differences in the two observation periods. In fact, the data relative to cleaned PV modules have been collected in autumn when the irradiance variability due to the presence of clouds has reduced the accuracy of the models. Once the models have been developed and tested, the power losses (PL) due to the soiling effect have been calculated as follows: PL=PSTCclean-PSTCdirtyPSTCclean100 where PSTCclean and PSTCdirty are the power calculated at STC for clean and dirty PV modules respectively. As reported in Table 3 , power losses calculated with the BNNs at STC are equal to 5.4% and 0.9% in plant 1 and plant 2 respectively. Plant 1 and plant 2 are affected differently by the pollution phenomena because of the different type of the ground where they\u2019ve been installed [8]. As was said before, plant number 1 is erected on a sandy ground while plant number 2 on a green one. Table 3 reports also the results given by the Polynomial Regression Model (PRM); these are very close to the ones given by the BNN models and the differences are not remarkable (5.5% versus 5.4% for plant 1, and 1.0% versus 0.9% for plant 2). The statistical errors reported in Table 3 shows that BNN models perform slightly better than PRM ones. A comparison between the power calculated with the two different techniques is given in Figs. 6a, 6b,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "6c and 6d for plants 1 and 2 respectively. For both plants, four different situation have been considered: Sunny day (before cleaning the PV modules). Sunny day (after cleaning the PV modules). Cloudy day (before cleaning the PV modules). Cloudy day (after cleaning the PV modules). Figs. 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d show that the power calculated over a day with the two different techniques are very well correlated as confirmed by the correlation factor that is greater than 0.99. Moreover, it can be observed that the performance of the two models is not influenced by the weather conditions (sunny or cloudy day). Given the fact that both BNN and PRM techniques provide reliable results when calculating percentage power losses, the differences in accuracy can be evaluated by examining the several error indexes. The following are the factors that influence the model development and its consequent behavior: Intrinsic accuracy of the polynomial model P=a+b\u00b7Tc\u00b7Gi+c\u00b7Gi+d\u00b7Gi2. Different objective functions: classic Ee(e)=12\u2211i=1N(y-y\u0303)i2 for the PRM model; modified objective function S=\u03b2Ee+\u03b1Ew for the BNN model. Choice of the initial values for the coefficients a, b, c and d. Choice of initial values (random) for weights and bias in the BNN model. Number of samples utilized for the determination of the polynomial coefficients and network training. The advantage of the BNN, is that the models are robust and the validation process, which scales as O(N2) in normal regression methods, is unnecessary [30]. BNN models are robust since they are difficult to over-fit or over-train, they offer good accuracy and have the capability of generalization with respect to the classical NNs. This is proved by the data shown in Table 4 which reports the comparison between Multi-layer perceptron (MLPN), Radial basis function network (RBFN) and Bayesian neural network. As can be seen, for practically the same MAPE (1.1%), we have different structure, RBFN (21 neurons within the hidden layer), MLPN (13 neurons within the hidden layer).  A simple and accurate model using BNN has been developed in order to evaluate the power losses of two photovoltaic plants. The results indicate that the losses due to dust accumulation on poly-crystalline Si PV modules surface ranges from roughly 1% to 5% after 1 year of operation. It has been demonstrated that estimating power at STC using the BNN model is more accurate than the one estimated by the polynomial model. Several factors affect the polynomial model accuracy which is also strongly influenced by the size of the database. In fact it has been noted that a large database is required to tune better the polynomial coefficients, while in the case of BNN, a 4000 samples dataset is largely sufficient to adapt the weights and bias of the network. The developed methodology has a significant value for the operation and maintenance personnel that would schedule the clean-up intervention once the percentage loss of power is above an acceptable threshold. In countries like Italy, where investments on renewable energy are paid off proportionally to the produced energy, a PV plant underperformance directly affects the payback time and the return on investment indexes. Grid operators can also benefit from the proposed technique. In fact, once their own PV plant model is created, they can predict its power output given the weather forecasts for the following day. Such information is useful for dispatch planning and it will have a fundamental role in the near future when considering the smart grid energy generation and distribution systems. Future contribution concerns the evaluation of how the dust accumulation on PV modules surface affects the module behavior when considering different technologies (poly-crystalline Si, CIGS, CdTe, etc.). The test field for this investigation is already in place at the University of Trieste where data are being gathered.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2014.05.015.txt", "paper": ["Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been largely studied due to its potential application ranging from gas sensing , water photoelectrolysis , photocatalysis , biocoatings and solar cells . Nevertheless, the wide energy gap of TiO2 (3.0 eV for rutile and 3.2 eV for anatase) limits the absorption of solar spectrum to <387 nm range . In order to reduce this drawback for the potential applications in photovoltaic, the surface of TiO2 is being sensitized with dye (DSSC) or with quantum dots (QDSSC) . The main advantage of quantum dots is related to the quantum confinement effect, which enables multiple excitations by the absorption of a single photon. Commonly, quantum dots of CdS have been used for making the TiO2 photoelectrode more sensitive to the visible spectrum of the sunlight . Another way of improving the performance of solar cells is considering 1D nanotubular structures , which enhance the surface area without geometric extension and facilitate the propagation and kinetic separation of photogenerated charges. For obtaining such nanostructures, the anodization technique has been widely used due to its reliability and simplicity. In this work, after anodization and calcination, a pulsed laser deposition method (PLD) has been applied for obtaining the nanosize CdS layer of quantum dots on the entire inner and outer surface of TiO2 nanotubes providing a large contact area between CdS and TiO2 nanotubes and thus, the wider absorption range of solar spectrum. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of CdS on TiO2 nanotubes and to precisely investigate the influence of CdS deposit on absorption properties of the nanocomposites. The morphological and chemical analysis were carried out by electron microscopy in scanning and transmission modes, together with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), in order to find a correlation between the number of laser pulses and the final amount of deposited CdS, as well as its spatial localization. Furthermore, the diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (DRS) was used for measuring the absorption properties of the as prepared samples.  For the preparation of titania nanotubes, titanium 1 cm \u00d7 3 cm plates (Alpha Aesar) of 0.5 mm thickness and 99.99% purity, were used as anodes. The plates were firstly cleaned by sonication in acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 30 min in each case. The synthesis was conducted according to a customized method published elsewhere . The electrolyte consisted of 50 ml deionized water with 0.6 mM HF and 0.1 mM CH3COOH and a platinum electrode served as a cathode. Anodization was performed at a constant voltage of 20 V for 30 min. The distance between the anode and cathode was 1.5 cm. After completing the anodization process, the samples were cleaned with deionized water. To obtain crystalline TiO2, the annealing of the samples was carried out in air up to 450 \u00b0C for 1 h with a heating rate of 7.5 \u00b0C/min and then cooled to the room temperature in 30 min . A PLD set-up was used to coat the nanotubes with CdS. The radiation generated by a pulsed KrF* laser source with a wavelength of 248 nm and a pulse duration of 25 ns was focused in a spot of 10 mm2 onto the surface of a CdS target at the repetition rate of 3 Hz. The laser energy was set at 200 mJ, so that the incident fluence was 2 J/cm2. The base pressure in chamber was 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 mbar and the temperature of the deposition substrate was kept at 25 \u00b0C. The substrate holder was placed parallel to the target at a 5 cm distance. The substrates were hit with 250, 500 and 1000 laser pulses and the corresponding samples were labeled as NT250, NT500 and NT1000, respectively. The surface morphology of the samples was studied using a Tescan MIRA3 XM FESEM. Chemical analysis of the samples was performed with a Jeol 2100F electron microscope operating at 200 kV equipped with a Cs probe corrector and a Gatan Tridiem energy filter. For the energy filtered imaging in transmission electron mode (EFTEM), the three-window method was systematically used, that provided the elemental 2D projections of Ti, O and S. For the S mapping, the three energy-filtered images were recorded at 125, 140 and 180 eV, respectively, with a 10 s exposure time and 30 eV width of the energy slit. The theoretical position of the L2,3-edge of S was taken from ESI, SI-1, to be 164.8 eV. Before transmission electron microscopy analysis, the surface of the samples was scratched with a diamond pin and copper grids were dragged over the surface in order to collect the fragments of nanotubes array. The diffuse reflectance spectra of selected samples were recorded using a Shimadzu 2600 UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere attachment ranging from 220 to 800 nm. A titanium plate was used as a reference.  Fig. 1(a) shows a typical SEM image of the as-synthesized TiO2 nanotubes array, which reveals a regular organization of the individual tubes. The inner diameter has a uniform size distribution centered around 100 nm. The direct comparison between Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows that the morphology of the TiO2 nanotubes does not change after the annealing treatment. The amorphous nature of the as-prepared nanotubes was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) performed in TEM mode on a fragment of the analyzed sample (Fig. 1(a)). The same approach was used to characterize the crystalline structure of the nanotubes after annealing (Fig. 1(b)). The SEM top views of the NT250, NT500 and NT1000 samples are given in Fig. 2(a-c) . By comparing Figs. 1 and 2, it is noticed that, as a consequence of the CdS deposition, the nanotube wall thickness increases from \u223c20 nm (Fig. 1) to \u223c25 nm for NT250 (Fig. 2(a)) and \u223c30 nm for NT500 (Fig. 2(b)), whereas TiO2 nanotubes of the sample NT1000 were completely filled and covered with CdS (Fig. 2(c)). It is well known that the excess of CdS, which is not in the direct contact with TiO2,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "cannot effectively absorb light and inject electrons and acts rather as a potential charge transfer barrier, thus lowering the solar cell efficiency . The detailed investigation of the CdS/TiO2 nanostructures of interest was therefore continued with NT250 and NT500 samples only. Table 1 summarizes the average (ave) and standard deviation (std dev) values of the chemical composition of the analyzed areas of the samples NT250 and NT500, obtained by EDS. The presence of the Ti, O, Cd and S can be seen and the ratio of Cd to S approximately equal to 1 confirms that stoichiometric CdS is deposited. Also, it can be observed that the sample NT500 contains larger amount of CdS than the sample NT250. This result is in accordance with the deposition conditions, since the sample NT500 had sustained 500 laser pulses, i.e. twice the number for sample NT250. In order to obtain chemically selective information at nanoscale, EELS technique was applied on different fragments of the two considered samples. To allow the analysis of relatively large areas, the energy filtered TEM (EFTEM), an imaging mode based on the EELS, was systematically applied. In general, the individual EFTEM images are forming across a spectrometer that selects inelastic scattered electrons with a given energy loss allowing the collection of signals emitted by a specific chemical element only. By choosing energy losses corresponding to the ionization edges of the elements of interest, their 2D chemical maps can be obtained with a resolution in nanometric range . It is worth noting that, given the low sensibility of EELS to the analysis of heavy elements such as Cd (Z = 48), for a correct chemical analysis it was necessary to associate the signals of Cd to the signal of S from EELS spectra, related to the presence of the CdS compound within the analyzed area of the tube array. To accurately determine the distribution of the CdS deposit inside the analyzed nanostructure, the EFTEM mode was used with the three-window method. Within this approach, two images are taken at energy losses below the ionization edge of the element of interest, and the third one at an energy loss located on this edge. The first two images are used to estimate the background and to calculate it at the energy edge position. The background is then subtracted from the third image pixel by pixel . In this work, the three-window method was used to provide elemental 2D projections of O, S and Ti. Given that the distribution of S is the main parameter of interest in this study, only the three filtered images for the S mapping, taken on one of the chosen fragments from the marked area in Fig. 3(a) of NT250 sample, are presented in Fig. 3(b), together with the resulting image of elemental projection of S. From the chemical analysis of the nanotubes cone base, it can be seen that S is surely present deeply between nanotubes (it is to mention that, in such 2D elemental map, the white pixels are always associated to the presence of the chosen element). The corresponding EELS spectrum is shown for convenience in Fig. 3(c). To confirm that the signal which appears across the nanotubes corresponds to CdS deposited inside the nanotubes, 2D chemical analysis were performed on another fragment of NT250 but this time in the top-view configuration. Fig. 4 illustrates the 2D chemical maps corresponding to the three elements of interest (Ti, O and S). By analyzing in particular the 2D chemical map corresponding to the S signal it can clearly be observed its presence also inside the nanotubes. The zero-loss image, which contains shape-sensitive information, is represented in Fig. 5(a) and was compared to the 2D elemental relative map of the analyzed fragment from NT250 tube array, shown in Fig. 5(b). The last image was obtained by superimposing the individual map recorded for S (in green), Ti (in blue) and O (in red). Using the same approach, a 2D chemical analysis of the NT500 sample in top-view configuration was performed. Fig. 6(a) shows the shape-sensitive zero-loss image of the selected area of the corresponding tube array, whereas Fig. 6(b) presents the corresponding 2D elemental relative map (S in green, Ti in blue and O in red) of the same area. A qualitative analysis of the chemical results obtained on the selected fragments of the two samples evidenced that the CdS is deposited partially in the inner part of the tubes but it is also present between the tubes. According to our observations the selected fragments can be considered representative for the whole samples in this framework study. Fig. 7 presents the UV\u2013Vis absorption reflectance spectrum of the bare TiO2 nanotubes array sample (curve (a)), together with the spectra of the sample NT250 (curve (b)) and NT500 (curve (c)). The absorption edges, inferred from the intersection of the sharply decreasing region of a spectrum with its baseline, are 414 nm for the bare TiO2, 467 nm for NT250 and 500 nm for NT500 with the second threshold at 633 nm. In the case of NT500, the first absorption threshold is assumed to be due to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers or excitonic fluorescence, while the second threshold at 633 nm was assigned to the recombination of charge carriers in deep traps of surface defect states . According to these results, it follows that TiO2 nanotubes sensitized with CdS via PLD is responsible for visible light harvesting. Since the surface of the samples is optically rough, it was appropriate to use Kubelka\u2013Munk model to study more exhaustively the optical properties of the coatings . The Kubelka\u2013Munk model uses the relation between the absorption coefficient \u03b1 and the bandgap E g, through the equation: (\u03b1h\u03bd)s=h\u03bd\u2212Eg where h\u03bd is the incident photon energy and s = 0.5 for indirect bandgap materials such as TiO2 is commonly thought to be . To determine the bandgaps of the studied samples, the Tauc plots of transformed Kubelka\u2013Munk function [F(R)\u00b7h\u03bd]1/2 versus h\u03bd, where F(R) = \u03b1. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "= (1 \u2212 R)2/(2R) and R is the percentage of reflected light , were represented in Fig. 8 . By linear extrapolation, the values of E g was found to be 3.01 eV for the bare TiO2 nanotubes array, 2.65 eV for the NT250 sample, while the two values were obtained for NT500 sample of 2.50 and 1.96 eV . The bandgap for NT250 is superior to the value reported for CdS in bulk (2.40 eV ), indicating that the size of the CdS deposit in this sample is within the quantum dots scale . The lower value of E g = 1.96 eV for NT500 sample, compared to CdS in bulk, can be due to the lattice distortion, that causes aggregation of vacancies acting like trap states leading to lower band-to-band transition energy. However, this can also be attributed to presence of impurities, which can act as dopants .  TiO2 nanotubes arrays prepared by anodization of Ti foils were used as substrates for the deposition of CdS via PLD technique. The results obtained here clearly demonstrate that PLD is an appropriate technique for the controlled deposition of CdS inside and/or between TiO2 nanotubes, deeply to the nanotubes base. The EFTEM technique was demonstrated to be the most suitable characterization method of obtained nanocomposites due to its ability to evidence the spatial distribution of CdS deposit by analyzing the tubes in lateral and in top-view orientations. In particular, it was shown that the quantity of CdS and its selective localization between or inside the TiO2 tubes is strongly dependent on the number of applied laser pulses. The diffuse reflectance measurements of CdS/TiO2 nanocomposites showed that the presence of CdS nanocoating significantly extends the response of TiO2 nanotubes toward the visible region. It can be hypothesized that by reducing the bandgap of TiO2 nanotubes with pulse laser deposited CdS one can enhance the photovoltaic performance of this nanocomposite for a more efficient utilization of lower energy photons.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

It has been demonstrated that ZnO is useful in a wide range of applications, including solar cells, ultraviolet lasers, light-emitting diodes, transparent conductors, photocatalytic materials, gas sensors, and luminescence materials. Various ZnO nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanowires, nanospheres, nanodisks, and nanoflowers, have been fabricated by thermal evaporation , hydrothermal synthesis , solution routes , microwave irradiation , vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid growth , pulsed laser ablation , plasma , and electric discharge . While there are several ZnO nanostructures, the flower-like morphology, as a special three-dimensional structure, has received the most attention in recent years because of its unique photoluminescence (PL) and photocatalytic properties . The optical and electrical properties of ZnO are related to its structural defects. It has been reported that the visible emission of ZnO is mainly related to intrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies (Vo), interstitial oxygen (Oi), zinc vacancies (VZn) and interstitial zinc (Zni) . These defects can affect photocatalytic performance; that is, acting as active centers, they can capture photo-induced electrons, thereby inhibiting the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes . Recently, the synthesis of ZnO, CuO and SnO nanocrystals using a solution plasma technique was reported . In our previous study, ZnO nanoflowers precipitated from Zn(OH)4 2\u2212 ions . However, the mechanism of oxide nanoflower formation via solution plasma has not been investigated thoroughly. In addition, the photoluminescence and photocatalytic properties of ZnO nanoflowers are not yet fully understood, in spite of their importance. To investigate this further, in the present study, the effects of electrolyte temperature and agitation, which we expected to affect the stability of Zn(OH)4 2\u2212 ions, were examined. In addition, the photoluminescence and photocatalytic properties of the products and the effect annealing were studied, in an effort to determine the types of defects present.  As reported previously , the experimental setup consisted of two electrodes in a glass cell. The cathode comprised a Zn wire (diameter: 1.0 mm; purity: 99.99%) placed at the center of the cell. Voltage was applied using a direct current power supply (ZX800H, Takasago). The electrolyte was a 0.5 M K2CO3 solution, with a purity of 99.5%. The electrolyte temperature was measured at a depth of 10 mm using a polymer-coated thermistor (Ondotori TR-71Ui, T&D). The current and voltage were measured using the DC power supply. The light emission from plasma was measured using a visible light spectrophotometer (USB 2000+, Ocean Optics). Experimental conditions for studying the effects of agitation and electrolyte temperature on nanoparticle formation are shown in Table 1 . The \u201cS\u201d in the sample name means static conditions (i.e., without agitation), and \u201cA\u201d signifies that agitation was employed. Agitation, applied using a magnetic stirrer, was set at 1500 rpm. The solution plasma method employed was as follow. After heating the solution to 60 \u00b0C, the applied voltage was increased from 0 to 80 V at a rate of 0.5 V s\u22121, then maintained at 80 V for one hour. During electrolysis, the reaction temperature was fixed by controlling the electrolyte temperature as shown in the Table 1. The temperature was changed stepwise in three steps using water at 25 \u00b0C and a hotplate. Afterward the products were collected by centrifugation, then washed with deionized water. Subsequently, the products were characterized using a JSM-7001FA (JEOL) scanning electron microscope (SEM), a Miniflex II (Rigaku) X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and a JEM-2010F (JEOL) transmission electron microscope (TEM). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed at room temperature using a Xe lamp line (FP-6400, JASCO) at a wavelength of 325 nm. The photocatalytic activities of the products were determined by measuring the rate of degradation of methylene blue under UV light, at an applied power of 30 W. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 40 mg of dried product was added to 200 ml of a solution of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 mg L\u22121 methylene blue in water. The mixture was first sonicated for 12 h in the dark to reach the adsorption equilibrium, then irradiated with UV light at room temperature. Before and after UV irradiation, the concentration of methylene blue was measured using a visible light spectrophotometer (USB 2000+ USB-ISS-VIS, Ocean Optics).  Experimental results are shown in Table 2 . The current was increased at high temperatures. As we observed in previous work, at high temperature a gas layer completely covered the electrode, preventing current flow . High current flow led to production of a large amount of particles. SEM images and XRD patterns of the products are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. From the XRD results, the ratio of ZnO to Zn increased with increasing temperature under static conditions. Sample S-3 contained primarily ZnO nanoflowers, with only a small number of Zn particles, while S-1 consisted solely of Zn particles. Sample S-2 contained many horn-shaped structures on the particle surfaces, which grew into the rod-shaped structures seen in S-3. According to the TEM observation, rod-like crystals grew in the [0 0 0 1] direction on the surface of the spherical particles (see supporting information). The peaks acquired became sharper with increase in the temperature of the solution from which the samples were prepared, indicating that samples with a greater degree of crystallinity were obtained at higher temperatures. The crystallite size (t) of these samples was calculated using Scherer's equation given in Eq. (1). t=K\u03bbBcos\u03b8 In the above equation, K is the shape factor (K = 0.9 in this study), \u03bb is the wavelength of the incident X-rays, B is the line broadening (measured in radians) at half the maximum intensity, and \u03b8 is the Bragg angle. The most intense peak at 2\u03b8 = 36.25\u00b0 was used for the calculation. The crystallite sizes were calculated as 13.4 nm and 42.7 nm for the samples synthesized at 69 \u00b0C and 81 \u00b0C, respectively. When the solution was agitated, all products were spherical in shape and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "no flower-like structures formed. The XRD patterns in Fig. 2 indicate that these products were mainly metallic Zn; no ZnO peaks were observed. TEM images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results obtained with a sample prepared using agitation (A-3) are shown in Fig. 3 . As seen in Fig. 3(a), both coarse (diameter: >500 nm) and fine particles were formed in the A-3 condition. From the EDS result shown in Fig. 3(b), the coarse particles consisted mainly of metallic zinc, while the fine particles contained 50 at% oxygen. Fig. 3(c)\u2013(e) shows fine particles and their corresponding selected-area electron-diffraction (SAED) patterns. According to Fig. 3(d), the fine particles had an amorphous structure. However, upon irradiation with a strong convergent electron beam, the applied heat caused the structure to change to polycrystalline ZnO. Light emission with glow discharge was observed in all experiments. Fig. 4 shows the optical emission spectrum from the solution plasma using Zn electrode at S-3 condition. The emissions from OH and Zn were observed. These strong emissions from Zn suggested that the electrode was partially ionized. The excitation temperature is calculated using the Boltzmann plot method under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) as shown in the following Eq. (2): lnIij\u03bbijgiAij=\u2212EikT+lnN(T)U(T) Here, I ij is the emission intensity (330 nm, 334 nm, 468 nm, 472 nm and 481 nm), \u03bb ij is the wavelength, g i is the statistical weight of the upper level, A ij is the transition probability, E i is the upper level energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, N(T) is the total number density of neutrals, and U(T) is the partition function. The excitation temperature is found to be 4000 K as shown in Fig. 5 . Hattori et al. have reported that excitation temperature was 3200 \u00b1 500 K from Zn electrode using microwave plasma in water. Proposed formation mechanisms with and without agitation are shown in Fig. 6 . During the plasma, the electrode is partially melted or vaporized by the current concentration. Melted Zn is peeled from electrode surface to form spherical Zn particles due to interfacial tension. Vaporized zinc was ionized in the plasma to form Zn(OH)4 2\u2212, according to the following reactions: Zn(g) \u2192 Zn2+ + 2e\u2212 Zn2+ + 2(OH)\u2212 \u2192 Zn(OH)4 2\u2212 The unstable Zn(OH)4 2\u2212 ions reach supersaturation, then precipitate as ZnO crystals according to Eq. (5). Zn(OH)4 2\u2212 \u2192 ZnO + H2O + 2(OH)\u2212 In this manner, ZnO nanoflowers grew on the surface of the remaining spherical particles, preferentially along the [0 0 0 1] direction . Ionization was enhanced at high temperature; in the absence of agitation (e.g., the S-3 sample), this resulted in long ZnO nanorods. However, when agitation was applied, Zn(OH)4 2\u2212 ions were immediately cooled to form amorphous ZnO nanoparticles without crystal growth. To study the effect of annealing on defect evolution, the ZnO nanoflowers (S-3) were annealed at 500 \u00b0C or 700 \u00b0C in the air for one hour. After annealing at 500 \u00b0C, the ZnO peaks in the XRD patterns became sharp and some metallic zinc remained. On the other hand, at 700 \u00b0C, virtually all the Zn was oxidized to ZnO. The SEM observations of the samples after annealing indicated that although some particles were agglomerated, the flower-like structure was largely preserved (please refer to the supporting information). Fig. 7 shows the PL spectra of the A-3 spherical particles, S-3 ZnO nanoflowers, and annealed nanoflowers, obtained using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. A broad green emission ranging from 480 to 580 nm was observed in case of the spherical particles and the ZnO nanoflowers. The peak positions in case of the samples comprising of the spherical particles and ZnO nanoflowers were evaluated as 539 nm and 545 nm, respectively. This green emission from ZnO, reported by many researchers , originates from Vo, Oi, VZn and Zni. The green emission at 520\u2013550 nm is related to the electron transition from the conduction band to Oi (2.28 eV, 544 nm) and Vo (2.30 eV, 539 nm). The difference in the peak positions observed in the PL spectra acquired from spherical particles and ZnO nanoflowers was probably induced by differences in the defect structure. Annealing led to a reduction in green emissions, attributable to a decrease in the number of defects . Note that the small peaks in the starting samples at 460\u2013470 nm remained after annealing. According to the literature , PL peaks at 468 nm are related to the defects VZn, Zni and Vo. Some researchers have reported the PL measurements at different excitation wavelengths . If there is variation in the origins of the asymmetry of the broad PL band, the PL spectra may shift when different excitation wavelengths are used. Fig. 8 shows the PL spectra acquired from ZnO nanoflowers at different excitation wavelengths ranging from 300 to 360 nm. In this study, any peak-shift was not observed. To determine photocatalytic activity, degradation of methylene blue was measured under UV light irradiation; results are shown in Fig. 9 . In general, the dependence of photocatalytic reaction rates on the concentration of organic pollutants is described well by the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood kinetic model . r=dCdt=kKC1+KC Eq. (6) can be simplified to a pseudo first order equation represented in Eq. (7). \u2212lnCC0=kKt=k\u2032t In the above equations, r is the rate of the reaction, C 0 is the initial concentration, C is the concentration of the reactant at time t (min), k is the reaction rate constant (min\u22121), and K is the adsorption coefficient. The apparent rate constants k app were calculated from the linear transform \u2212ln(C/C 0) = kt + b, as shown in Fig. 9(b). The apparent rate constants shown by the S-3 ZnO nanoflowers, commercial ZnO particles, and ZnO nanoflowers annealed at 700 \u00b0C were 0.0034, 0.028, and 0.049 min\u22121, respectively. Compared to the commercial ZnO particles, ZnO nanoflowers with no annealing showed lower photocatalytic activity, because the nanoflowers contained defects and significant levels of metallic Zn. After annealing at 700 \u00b0C, the photocatalytic activity of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "ZnO nanoflowers increased, as a consequence of their highly crystalline structure and high surface area.  ZnO nanoparticles were prepared using a solution plasma technique, and the effects of temperature and agitation on product morphology and composition were investigated. The photoluminescence and photocatalytic activity of the products were also studied. The following conclusions were drawn: When the electrolyte temperature was high and there was no agitation, flower-like ZnO precipitated. Use of agitation led to spherical products, i.e., coarse metallic Zn and amorphous ZnO nanospheres. Melting and vaporization of the electrode produced particles. ZnO nanoflowers grew on the surface of spherical particles by precipitation from Zn(OH)4 2\u2212 ions. Because of their defects, ZnO nanoflowers and amorphous ZnO showed strong green emissions when irradiated at 325 nm. The 700 \u00b0C annealed ZnO nanoflowers had higher photocatalytic activity than as-prepared product. These findings are applicable not only to zinc but also to other metals and alloys. We hope that the results will lead to further development of the use of solution plasma for nanoparticle synthesis, with enhanced ability to control product morphology and composition.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Nano TiO2 also shows high photocatalytic activity as it has high sensitivity to light and large specific surface area . Nano TiO2-based photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds, such as methyl orange (MO) , methylene blue , humic acid , and so on, has been well reported. However, applications of TiO2 of all sizes are limited due to recovery, dispersion, high recombination rate of photo-induced electron\u2013hole pairs, and so on. Some have tried to overcome the aforementioned limitations. For instance, magnetically separable photocatalysts of TiO2/SiO2/Fe3O4 nanoparticles were suggested in order to improve the recovery from treated water . Nakanish et al. reported that dendrimers prevented TiO2 nanoparticles from agglomeration by forming a protective sphere. Dendrimers are highly branched macromolecules with well-defined composition and structure . They are built up of three-dimensional architecture, \u201cbranch cells\u201d that are organized in concentric layers around a core . They can be divided into three main components: a core, interior branch cells, and terminal branch cells which can be functionalized. For this reason, the overall chemical and physical properties of dendrimers can be configured to specific needs by changing the terminal branch cells at outermost generation . Due to their structural features, dendrimers have been widely applied in many fields including biomaterial, biomedicine, targeting carrier, therapeutic treatment of cancer cell, catalysis, drug delivery, and so on . Some recent studies include environmental applications. For example, Diallo et al. investigated the removal of copper from water using various generation of poly amidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers with ethylene diamine core and terminal NH2 groups. Magnetite-cored dendrimers with an advantage of easy magnetic separation were also proposed for heavy metal uptake from water . In this research, we report the synthesis of magnetic-cored dendrimers with TiO2 terminal groups for possible applications in water treatment, solar cells, and so on. We hypothesized that this new material can aid: (i) enhanced recovery from treated water using magnetic force, (ii) better dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles due to the incorporation of them into dendrimer structure, and (iii) photo-induced electron transfer from TiO2 to magnetic-cored dendrimer. Therefore, the objective of this study was to experimentally test the three hypotheses in photocatalytic decolorization of MO.  MO, C14H14N3SO3Na, was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). TiO2 powder (Degussa P25) with mainly anatase (80%), average particle size of 30 nm, and surface area of 50 m2/g, was purchased from Degussa AG (Germany). Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4\u00b77H2O), 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APT, H2N(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3), and titanium (IV) isopropoxide (C12H28O4Ti) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3\u00b76H2O) and methyl acrylate (CH2CHCOOCH3) were purchased from Junsei (Japan). Ammonium hydroxide (NH3\u00b7H2O) and diethyl carbonate (DEC, C5H10O3) were purchased from Daejung Chemical (Korea). Ethylenediamine (NH2CH2CH2NH2), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and methanol (CH3OH) were from Kanto Chemical (Japan) and Duksan Chemical (Korea), respectively. Double distilled and deionized water was used throughout the work. All chemicals were reagent grade or above and used without further treatment. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) were synthesized by coprecipitation of Fe(III) chlorides and Fe(II) sulfate (FeIII/FeII ratio = 2) with NH3\u00b7H2O . The products were washed with deionized water and methanol after the reaction. Twelve gram of the as-synthesized MNP methanol suspension was stirred with 57.88 mL of APT for 7 h at 60 \u00b0C. The products were washed with methanol and deionized water several times. Dendrimer of generation 0 (G0) represents the as-synthesized magnetite nanoparticles modified only with APT. Ten gram of G0 was dispersed in 500 mL methanol and 100 mL methyl acrylate. The suspension was ultrasonicated and stirred at room temperature for 7 h. The particles were washed with methanol 5 times, and then the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 3 h after 20 mL ethylenediamine was added. Methylacrylate and ethylenediamine were added for dendrimer branches to be linked onto the MNP surface . The synthesized magnetic-cored dendrimers (MD) were stored in methanol after five times of rinsing with methanol and deionized water. Amide terminals of MD were converted to TiO2 groups to attain photoresponsible magnetic-cored dendrimers in this research (Fig. 1 ). The MDs were dispersed in 200 mL methanol with 100 mL DEC as inorganic binder. The suspension was sonicated for 30 min and stirred at 60 \u00b0C for 6 h, and then washed with methanol 3 times. Subsequently, 80 mL titanium(IV) isopropoxide was added into pre-synthesized solution in a Teflon container for solvothermal process. The Teflon container under stainless steel reactor was placed in furnace at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h, after which 38.8 mL of concentrated H2SO4 (95%) dissolved in 180 mL water was added and kept at 60 \u00b0C . The resultant product was washed with deionized water five times and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 \u00b0C. Nano TiO2 (nTiO2) was prepared in the same process only without MD. Some MNP and nTiO2 were physically mixed together at the same ration of iron and titanium in TD for comparison purpose (MT). Fourier transform-infrared spectra (FT-IR) of the samples were recorded on a Nicolet Magna-IR 760 ESP spectrometer (Thermo, USA) from 4000 to 400 cm\u22121 with KBr as the reference sample. Measurements were done in transmission mode with spectroscopic grade KBr pellets for powders. Crystal structure of the samples was characterized using a X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX RINT 2000, Japan) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418740 \u00c5) as X-ray source, operated at 40 kV and 100 mA in the range of 2\u03b8 = 20\u201380\u00b0. Morphology of the TD was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 16 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by dispersing in ethanol and then dropping the suspension on carbon\u2013copper grids. Energy dispersive spectrum was equipped with a TEM detector for elemental analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Multilab 2000, Thermo VG Scientific, United Kingdom) was used and the X-ray source (Al K\u03b1, 1253.6 eV) was operated at 10 kV and 30 mA. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-100,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "PSIA, South Korea) was performed at room temperature. Magnetic properties along with unpaired electrons from oxygen vacancies in TiO2 crystals were measured with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID, MPMS-XL model, Quantum design, USA) . The specific surface area (BET) of TD was measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument, using the adsorption of N2 at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K). The fluorescence spectra and lifetime was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Scinco, FluoroMate FS-2) with a 150 W Xe lamp. Excitation and emission slit width and scan rate were kept constant at 10 nm and 600 nm/min, respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at room temperature using a closed-cycle liquid helium cryogenerator (APD, SH-4, USA), a spectrometer (f = 0.5 m, Acton Research Co., Spectrograph 500i, USA), and an intensified photo diode array detector (Princeton Instrument, IR Y1024, USA). A He\u2013Cd laser (Kimon, 1K, Japan) with a wavelength of 325 nm was used as an excitation light source. Photocatalytic decolorization experiments were carried out in a quartz column reactor with maximum volume of 1.5 L. Four 6 W UV-C lights with a radiant wavelength of 254 nm (Philips, USA) were used as ultraviolet light source. The distance between the UV lamps and the quartz reactor was 15 mm. Five hundred mL aqueous MO solution at 10 mg/L was added to the reactor with 0.5 g of catalyst samples. To determine the adsorption constants, different MO concentrations were used. After certain time intervals, 1.5 mL aliquots were sampled and separated magnetically to remove the nanoparticles. The MO samples were analyzed with a UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-mini 1240, Japan) equipped with a UV detector at 254 nm. Reusability of TD catalysts was tested in five cycles of repetitive decolorization experiments with initial MO at 3 mg/L and 0.5 g TD. After each cycle, the UV light was turned off and TD was separated with a magnet. The photocatalytic reactor was rinsed with deionized water, which was then replenished with fresh MO aqueous solution. The recovered TD was regenerated by washing with distilled water three times.  FT-IR spectra of MD, nTiO2, and TD are shown in Fig. 2(A). Several characteristic peaks of TD were observed, confirming successful modification of MD to TD. The banding vibration of \u2013NH2 group is seen at 3440 cm\u22121 and the stretching vibration of C=O is found at 1732 cm\u22121 . The band at 2363 cm\u22121 is CO2 that comes from ambient air . The absorption bands at 1096.9 and 1010.1 cm\u22121 are due to Si\u2013O\u2013Si and Si\u2013O\u2013Fe , which confirms the aminosilanization reaction was successfully achieved. The characteristic absorption band of Fe\u2013O bond is at 579 cm\u22121 . A new peak at 987 cm\u22121 corresponds to stretching of Ti\u2013O\u2013C , indicating that TiO2 is chemically bonded to the terminals of MD. The bending mode of Ti\u2013O groups corresponds to the characteristic peak of TiO2 at 420\u2013800 cm\u22121 , indicating successful combination of MD and TiO2. Fig. 2(B) shows the XRD spectra of TD, nTiO2, P25, and MNP in this research. Relevant peaks of TD were observed in the spectra of both anatase crystal and magnetite, which indicated that TD had photocatalytic and magnetic properties. Diffraction of Degussa P25 TiO2 indicates the presence of anatase (JCPDS File no. 21-1272) and to a lesser extent rutile (JCPDS File no. 21-1276), as in the composition given by the manufacturer (80% anatase and 20% rutile). XRD patterns of the MNP used as a seed for dendrimer in this research match well with the standard patterns for bulk magnetite (JCPDS File no. 19-0629). The TD in this research is also confirmed to contain Fe and Ti as shown in Fig. 3(A) in Supporting Information. Fig. 3(B) shows the XPS pattern of Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2 peaks at 710.1 and 723 eV, respectively. These binding energies are the same as those of Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2 in magnetite . Ti2p exhibited a narrow peak at about 458.7 eV and a broad peak at about 464.4 eV, which is the characteristic of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 3(C) . Fig. 2(C) shows the TEM image of TD. MDs with a diameter of about 14 nm were connected with TiO2 nanoparticles of bright globular shape. The average diameter of the TDs is estimated as 20\u201325 nm. Structural morphology of TD is revealed using three-dimensional AFM images in which the average TD size is calculated as 19 nm (Fig. 4 ). Deposition of nTiO2 (distance between green marks) and MD particles (distance between white marks) produced approximately 6 and 13 nm in height, respectively. Hysteresis loops of the samples with external magnetic field changed from \u22125 to 5 kOe at room temperature are in Fig. 2(D). Magnetization values of MNP, MD, and TD were estimated as 74.5, 62.8 and 43.4 emu/g, respectively. Magnetization values of the polymer-covered MNPs are much lower that of bare MNP. Magnetization value of MT was much smaller. Note that TD and MT exhibit different magnetization despite the same ratio of iron and titanium. Magnetization curve of TD, MT were close to the origin, indicating that TD, MT exhibit superparamagnetic properties at room temperature. With superparamagnetic property, TD can be recovered efficiently by magnetic field and easily redispersed in aqueous solution. The specific surface area (BET) of TD was measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument, using the adsorption of N2 at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K). The BET surface area of the TD nanoparticles was 120 m2/g and the BET surface area of P25 was 50 m2/g. A larger surface area provides more surface active sites for the adsorption of reactive molecules, which leads the photocatalytic process to be more efficient . Photocatalytic decolorization of MO was experimented with P25, MNP, nTiO2, TD, and MT, under UV light (\u03bb = 254 nm). Decolorization kinetics was faster with P25, compared to the others. Interestingly, decolorization kinetic with TD was much faster than with MT while the two contain the same ratio of Fe and Ti. Photodecolorization with TD at. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "different initial concentrations of MO is shown in Fig. 5(B). Almost complete decolorization was achieved within 180 min at 3.05 \u00d7 10\u22123, 6.11 \u00d7 10\u22123, and 9.16 \u00d7 10\u22123 mM of MO. MO decolorization with TD in this research can be adequately modeled with the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood (L\u2013H) kinetics, which takes into account the adsorption of the dye over the surface of TD, surface reaction, and desorption of products as shown in Fig. 5(C). The rate of reaction can be: 1r0=1kL\u2212HKadsC0+1kL\u2212H where r 0 is the initial decolorization rate of MO (mg/L/min), k L\u2013H is the observed decolorization rate constant, K ads is the adsorption coefficient of MO, and C 0 is initial MO concentration (mg/L). The parameters were determined from the slope and intercept of the linear fit of the 1/r 0 vs. 1/C 0 in Fig. 5(C). Calculated K ads (L/mg) and k L\u2013H (mg/L/min) were 0.0812 and 0.0478, respectively. (Table 1 ). Photocatalytic decolorization is initiated by photoexcitation of the semiconductor and formation of electron hole pairs on the surface of the catalysts. The pH decreased during UV irradiation because more NO3 \u2212, SO4 2\u2212, PO4 3\u2212, CO2, and H2O were produced with the reaction . Optimal pH for the reaction between TiO2 and MO is reported as between 4.4 and 6.25 . Strong electrostatic attraction between MO and TiO2 was reported at pHs above 4.4 while weak attraction was monitored below at pHs less than 4.4 . MO rapidly decreased for initial 120 min due to electrostatic attraction between MO and TiO2 (Fig. 6 ). Photoexcitation in the semiconductor causes the formation of electron\u2013hole pairs on the catalyst surface. When the nTiO2 particles in TD are irradiated with UV having energy higher than its band gap energy, the electrons in the valence band are promoted to the conduction band. These photogenerated electrons are transferred to the polymer of TD, facilitating the hole\u2013electron separation. Fluorescence emission of the P25, nTiO2, MT, and TD was measured in ethanol. The intensity value was in the order of P25 > nTiO2 > MT > TD. This fluorescence emission intensity is closely related with electron transfer process . Excited electrons were rapidly transferred into polymeric structure of the TD and less recombination was observed with the TD. The recombination process occurs in the microsecond or sub-microsecond time scale. The fluorescence lifetimes are given in Table 2 . Longer lifetime indicates a decrease in recombination rate . Longer lifetime of the TD can be due to the TD dendritic branches. Photoluminescence emission spectra are useful to disclose the efficiency of charge carrier and to understand the fate of electron\u2013hole pairs in semiconductor particles . The effect of TD polymeric structure on the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs was further investigated with photoluminescence spectra of MT, nTiO2, and TD at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm (Fig. 7 ). The TD exhibited much lower emission intensity than nTiO2 and MT, implying that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes was greatly inhibited in TD. Photogenerated electrons of excited nTiO2 could be transferred instantly from the conduction band of nTiO2, resulting in an improved charge separation and consequently higher photocatalytic activity than nTiO2 alone. Similarly, electron transfer between TiO2 and polymers were observed in other systems . Repetitive use is very important for the environmental sustainability of catalysts. Regeneration and recovery of TD were carried out five consecutive runs. Fig. 8 suggests that MO decolorization with TD was about 90%, which indicated that TD maintained similar photocatalytic activity after five times of recycling.  The TD catalysts were successfully synthesized with MD and nTiO2. Synthesized TD could enhance MO adsorption and photodecolorization of MO compared to nTiO2. Experimental results showed that polymer of TD role in electron capture. Furthermore, the polymer of TD prevents the recombination of holes with electrons of TiO2, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for TD. Also, the TD of hybrid catalyst is conveniently recoverable due to the magnetic core. In summary, MD containing nTiO2 functional groups exhibited restrained recombination electron\u2013hole pairs and high performance UV irradiation responsive catalyst and it can be widely used as a photocatalyst in various applications, including water treatment.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Development of three-dimensional (3D) tantalum and tantalum oxide nanostructures is of particular interest for potential applications in microelectronic devices with high surface-to-volume ratios, e.g., metal-insulator-metal (MIM) storage capacitors, thin-film transistors, electrochemical sensors, resistive switchers or emerging non-volatile random access memories (RRAMs). Ta2O5 can be also used in optical waveguides, surface acoustic wave devices [2], or as a coating material for antireflection layers of silicon solar cells and charge-coupled devices. The lowest limit for Ta2O5 capacitors is estimated to be around an equivalent oxide thickness of 1.5\u00a0nm [3]. Electrochemical deposition is a common technique to form a wide variety of metal and metal oxide semiconducting layers. It is a low-temperature, inexpensive and scalable process. Usually the electrodeposition takes place in aqueous solutions. However, tantalum cannot be electrodeposited from aqueous or most organic solutions. So far they have been obtained by sputter processes, chemical vapor deposition or by electrodeposition from high temperature molten salts. In principle, Ta layers can also be electrodeposited from ionic liquids. Electrodeposition takes place under an inert atmosphere to eliminate side reactions involving water or oxygen. Moreover, water reacts with fluorides to release HF, which is volatile and attacks glass, alumina, etc. So we work in the glove box partly to protect the experimenters. Both the ionic liquid and the deposition conditions influence strongly the quality and properties of the deposited layers. Other researchers have already made efforts to electrodeposit tantalum metal layers upon planar platinum and gold substrates [4\u20137]. Ispas et al. [4] found that elemental Ta can only be obtained in a narrow electrochemical potential range. In this work, tantalum electrodeposition via the porous anodic alumina template (PAA) was intended, most probably for the first time, except for a conference proceeding paper which we published in 2015, see the ref. [8]. Template-assisted electrodeposition is an elegant and economical approach for the large-scale synthesis of nanostructured materials, such as highly ordered porous films and free-standing nanorods/nanowires [9]. Since the introduction of the template synthesis [10], a variety of nanostructured metal films has been prepared via the template-assisted ED, such as Au, Pt, Bi, In, Ni, Ag, Cu [10\u201313]. However, to our best knowledge, there have been only few reports on templated ED of a single valve metal \u2013 aluminium, except for a short communication about template-based niobium electrodeposition [14]. Aluminium was electrodeposited from a non-aqueous media through thick porous anodic alumina (PAA) or polycarbonate membranes with open pores, i.e. without an alumina barrier layer [9,15\u201318]. Additionally, other non-templated techniques are applicable for the preparation of valve metal nanowires, such as the hydrothermal precursor synthesis in combination with VPC (vacuum pyrolysis/carbothermal treatment), which was already demonstrated for the preparation of tungsten nanowires [19,20]. However, those techniques require high temperature and vacuum which can be a disadvantage compared to ED at lower temperatures. The next step in the creation of some MIM structure, following the tantalum metal electrodeposition would be an anodic oxidation in an acidic solution to grow a dielectric layer of Ta2O5. However, in the present study we were striving to electrodeposit Ta via PAA, and have not yet addressed the anodisation step. Herein, tantalum-based (TaxOy mainly) nanostructures were electrodeposited in an air- and water-stable ionic liquid: 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(tri-fluoromethylsulphonyl) imide ([BMP]Tf2N), using an anhydrous salt, TaF5 as the source of Ta. In order to enable the electrodeposition it was necessary to render one face of the PAA template conductive. More on the preparation of the PAA template was published elsewhere [21]. A general schematic diagram of the tantalum electrodeposition upon an underlaying metal is shown in Fig. 1 . Assuming successful deposition of a tantalum-based layer, it was intended to characterize the deposit chemically, morphologically and electronically.  Tantalum nanotube arrays electrodeposition via the porous anodic alumina template (PAA) was intended. The PAA template had a conductive metal layer (valve metal) on the bottom which was necessary for the electrodeposition. The PAA template, possessing ~100\u00a0nm wide and 1\u00a0\u00b5m long pores, with ~109 cm\u22122 population density, was supplied from Brno University of Technology, group LabSensNano. The procedure of the PAA preparation has been published elsewhere, see ref. [21]. The electrolyte consisted of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoro-methylsulfonyl) imide, ([BMP]Tf2N) (Solvionic, 99.9%), containing 0.25\u00a0M TaF5 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) and 0.25\u00a0M LiF (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%). These were handled under inert gas (nitrogen) conditions (H2O, O2\u00a0<\u00a015\u00a0ppm). The electrodeposition cell was a glass flask with a PTFE lid over, holding the working and reference electrodes. The counter electrode consisted of platinum wire. Two types of working electrodes were employed: firstly, a planar glass-ceramic Sitall substrate with Ni/Cr adhesion layer and sputter-deposited gold layer on the top; secondly, a PAA template upon a valve metal on top of an oxide-coated silicon wafer. Electrodeposition was performed potentiostatically at \u22121.4\u00a0V vs. a platinum wire pseudo reference electrode at 200\u00a0\u00b0C. In some cases, prolonged electrodeposition led to the electrodeposit spreading beyond the template pores, to form a layer on top of the PAA, see Fig. 2 . Coulometry (chronoamperometry) measurements were implemented to estimate the end of the pores filling. The coulometry was performed during each electrodeposition experiment. Etching of the PAA template was done in aquous solution of 0.42\u00a0M phosporic acid and 0.2\u00a0M chromium trioxide at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h (based on selective etchant from ref. [22]). A high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilised to investigate the surface morphology of the deposited films in a LYRA3 TESCAN device. The thickness of deposit on top of the template was estimated by SEM analysis as well. 3D topography of the surface was visualized by the Bruker Dimension Icon atomic force microscopy (AFM) set in the ScanAsyst \u2013 air measuring mode. The broad range impedance spectrum analysis was carried out dry (without electrolyte), performed using \u00b5AutolabIII potentiostate/FR analyzer (Metrohm). The impedance frequency range was from 106 to 10\u22122 Hz. Three different types of specimens were analysed: the empty PAA (no-tantalum). but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "template and two specimens with the PAA containing electrodeposit. The impedance AC amplitude was 50\u00a0mV. The top gold electrode area was about 0.79\u00a0mm2, whereas the area of the valve metal bottom electrode equaled the geometric area of the electrodeposited specimen: ranging from 48 to 60\u00a0mm2. As the area of the top contact (0.79\u00a0mm2) was smaller (ca. 50 times) than the bottom contact area, evaluation of the impedance electrical parameters only for samples with no apparent deposit on top of the tempale was intended. The lack of extensive, conductive top layer underneath the gold contact ensured that the current would not spread sideways, causing significant uncertainty in the measurement area. Impedance results often reveal a frequency dispersion that cannot be described by simple elements such as resistances, capacitances, inductances or convective diffusion (e.g., Warburg) impedance. The frequency dispersion is generally attributed to a capacitance dispersion (frequency-dependent capacitance) expressed in terms of a constant-phase element (CPE) [23]. The impedance of CPE is defined as follows [24]: ZCPE=1Q(j\u03c9)\u03b1 where, Q (in F cm\u22122 sec\u03b1\u22121) and \u03b1 are the CPE parameters. \u03b1 equals the slope of the log\u2013log imaginary impedance plot vs frequency. Both parameters, as well as R from the equation below, were obtained by regression of a simple equivalent circuit implemented by an impedance analysis software (a graphical method). The so called effective equivalent capacitance CEFF value was then extracted from the parameters \u03b1, Q and R using the Hsu and Mansfeld formula [25]: Ceff=Q1/\u03b1R(1-\u03b1)/\u03b1 where R represents the film resistivity, Q and \u03b1 are the CPE parameters. The equation applies especially in the case of a 3D time constant distribution. A 3D distribution results from effects in the dimension normal to the electrode surface such as surface roughness, electrode porosity and varying coating composition [23]. The R equals to: R=\u2211iRi Ri represents the local properties of the layer in normal dimension to the electrode surface. The terms \u201cforward\u201d (FWD) and \u201creverse\u201d (RV) mode refered to positive and negative voltages on the top gold electrode, respectively, by analogy with the I-V characteristic of Schottky junction, see Fig. 2. The I-V characterization was performed at room temperature using a voltage sweep starting at 0\u00a0V with turning points at +5\u00a0V and \u22125 V. Scan rate amplitude was 100\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121. Thermal characterization of the electrical resistivity was performed dry, over a temperature range of 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 200\u00a0\u00b0C. A constant potential difference of 1\u00a0V was applied across the specimen for 150\u00a0s, with simultaneous current measurement. The resistivity was then calculated according to the Ohm\u2019s law. The positive lead was connected to the bottom W electrode. Unlike specimens used for the other analyses, the top electrode was made of W as well. Tungsten was chosen in place of gold, because of the clearer temperature-dependence of resistivity. XPS analyses were carried out with Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer using a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 (h\u03bd\u00a0=\u00a01486.7\u00a0eV) X-ray source operating at 150\u00a0W (10\u00a0mA, 15\u00a0kV). The spectra were obtained using an analysis area of ~300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0700\u00a0\u00b5m2. The Kratos charge neutralizer system was used for all analyses. The high resolution spectra were measured with the step size 0.1\u00a0eV and 20\u00a0eV pass energy. Instrument base pressure was 2\u00b710\u22128 Pa. Spectra were analysed using CasaXPS software (version 2.3.15) and have been charge corrected to the main line of the carbon C 1s spectral component (C\u2013C, C\u2013H) set to 284.80\u00a0eV. A standard Shirley background was used for all sample spectra. Specimens were analyzed both before and after annealing in a vaccum chamber. Annealing was carried out at 800\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h and pressure ranging from 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 Pa.  Fig. 3 shows a cyclic voltammogram of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium bis(tri-fluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([BMP]Tf2N) containing 0.25\u00a0M TaF5 and 0.25\u00a0M LiF at 200\u00a0\u00b0C on a sputter-deposited Au layer. The electroreduction of tantalum ions started at a potential of about \u22121.4\u00a0V versus Pt. In the reverse scan, the anodic scan of the cyclic voltammogram crosses the cathodic one to produce a current loop, meaning that higher potential was needed in the cathodic than in the anodic scan to reach the same value of the current density. This behaviour is a general characteristic of metal deposition on a foreign substrate, where an overpotential is required to commence nucleation [9]. Two anodic peaks were observed on the anodic scan, in the range \u22120.5 to 0.2\u00a0V vs. Pt, as a result of oxidation of the tantalum species. At a potential of about 1.3\u00a0V and above, a further oxidation process took place, probably due to electrochemical gold dissolution. A similar gold oxidation potential has been previously measured [6]. The electrochemical reduction of tantalum occurred at similar potentials on an exposed planar gold surface and through the PAA template. To date a detailed analysis of the redox processes has not been proposed. Our current interest was to determine whether tantalum electrodeposition was possible through porous anodic alumina, or if it might be hindered for kinetic reasons, considering the higher viscosity and lower conductivity of the ionic liquids compared to aqueous solutions. It is intended to report more about the cyclic voltammetry and the tantalum ions reduction in subsequent manuscripts. To investigate the growth of nanotubes within the template and estimate the end of the pores filling, chronoamperometry measurements were implemented. Fig. 4 shows chronoamperograms obtained during the growth of tantalum-based nanotubes within the PAA template at a constant potential of \u22121.4\u00a0V vs. Pt. Deposition was terminated after passage of different amounts of charge (which presumably corresponded to different amount of pore filling). The lowest charge density (in mC cm\u22122) would correspond to the shortest average tube length \u2013 assuming roughly uniform and reproducible growth. Once a potential was applied, a charged double layer formed at the electrode/ionic-liquid interface and reduction of the electroactive species located at the interface caused a concentration gradient, with ever thickening of the tantalum depletion zone, leading to the rapid decrease of cathodic current after a short time [9]. Subsequently, the current slowly increased. This behaviour is due to initial growth of TaxOy inside the pores, followed by a more significant increase of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the cathodic current, due to a faster diffusion near to the pore outlets. This assumed relatively uniform, diffusion-limited growth, where the diffusion lengths were getting progressively shorter. Such a type of growth was suspected due to a limited amount of the ionic liquid inside the pores, caused by their high aspect ratio (height:width) 10:1. When about 75 mC cm\u22122 had been passed on the cathode, see Fig. 4 (i), a limiting current plateau was observed. This was assumed to correspond to a beginning of the top layer formation. As soon as the top layer area enlarged, a further current enhancement was determined. In Fig. 4 we presented eight different samples, whereas one of them (specimen 110 mC) showed an anomolously low current density. The reason for this is not fully understood. Fig. 4 (ii) shows the chronoamperograms of the same samples as in Fig. 4 (i), whereas the current density was arranged against the deposition time. The constant current plateau was not that pronounced as in Fig. 4 (i) and the starting points of the plateau differed due to diverse current densities. Nevertheless, the plot shows that the deposition of the tantalum-based nanotubes usually takes less than one minute. Moreover, we approved that the current density arranged vs. charge density in Fig. 4 (i) helps in determination of the top layer growth starting point better than the time arrangement in Fig. 4 (ii). The difference in initial current densities will depend on many factors: i) electrolyte temperature, ii) impurities in the electrolyte, iii) exact contact area between ionic liquid and valve metal, iv) iR drop in the electrolyte (between reference electrode and working electrode), v) exact potential of the Pt pseudo reference electrode (although frequently employed in \u201cdifficult\u201d media, it does not provide a completely reproducible reference potential, in the absence of well-defined redox couples in the electrolyte), vi) cleanliness and morphology of the working electrode surface. Two different specimens with differing extents of cathodic charge density (and hence presumably thickness of the top layer) were studied in detail. The specimens were designated as: Non-negligible-TL (top layer) and Negligible-TL. Negligible-TL means a specimen with a very thin top layer over the TaxOy-nanotubes, see Fig. 5 (iv). The Non-negligible-TL specimen, Fig. 5 (iii) had thicker top layer compared to the Negligible-TL one. The thickness of the top layer was estimated by SEM, see below. Examination of the chemical composition and bonding states in the tantalum-based coatings was performed by XPS technique. XPS of the electrodeposited coatings was performed on diverse specimens both before and after annealing in a vacuum chamber. We found out that the tantalum-based coating, electrodeposited upon a planar ceramic substrate with a thin niobium overlayer, contained F, Li, Ta, O, and C (before annealing). Despite the high content of fluorine and lithium in the coating, these elements were removed during the annealing step. Fluorine and lithium were present both in the outer as well as in the inner region of the electrodeposited coatings. Lithium fluoride LiF as well as C-F bonds were determined in the coatings before annealing, see Fig. 6 (ii), spectrum F 1s. LiF was present directly in the electrodeposition bath, whereas C-F bonds originated from the ionic liquid ([BMP]Tf2N) component. Fluorides and oxides impurities were identified also by other researchers [4,5,7]. By annealing the specimen at 800\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h and pressure ranging from 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 Pa, fluorine and lithium-free material was obtained. Carbon however transformed into tantalum carbide TaCx (where x ~\u00a01.6). The spectra are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 , before and after the annealing, respectively. In the first case, the surface region was comprised of Ta(V) (~92 at.% as Ta2O5), Ta(IV) (~8 at.% as Ta-suboxide) and high amount of physisorbed LiF and C-F. After annealing, the superficial composition changed to Ta(V) (~61 at.% as Ta2O5), Ta(IV) (~12 at.% as Ta-suboxide) and TaC (~27 at.%), see Fig. 7 (i). We assume that, because of the facile reaction of Ta with trace concentrations of oxygen to form the pentoxide, most suboxide would be constrained to the inner regions of the coating. The XPS analysis did not reveal any significant evidence of tantalum metal in the electrodeposited nanostructures. In order to estimate if the tantalum metal was obtained by the electrodeposition and oxidized later through reaction with the air, we had determined charge density related to a hypothetical 100% efficient electrodeposition of Ta metal and compared it with the real charge density analysed for filling just the pores of the PAA template (75 mC cm\u22122). The charge density for the 100% coulombic efficient Ta(V)\u00a0+\u00a05e\u2212 \u2192 Ta reduction would be about 90 mC cm\u22122. Comparing the real charge density value with the hypothetical, we may conclude that the tantalum metal was the most probable component of the electroreduction with the current efficiency of about 84 %. Moreover, from Fig. 3, the cathodic charge passed looks higher than the anodic stripping charge between \u22121.0 to\u00a0+\u00a00.2\u00a0V, revealing some irreversibility of the system. The irreversibility might be due to some Ta metal oxidation \u2013 either in reaction with the Al2O3 surface (catalyzed with fluorides in the solution) or with trace moisture / oxygen in the electrolyte forming so the TaxOy oxides. The TaxOy are not accessible for stripping in the CV at the high scan rate of 100\u00a0mV/s, just the more labile Ta is anodically dissolved. The two anodic peaks determined at about \u22120.4\u00a0V and 0.1\u00a0V are assumed to be correlated to the Ta metal oxidation in steps, e.g., like Ta(0)-Ta(III)-Ta(V) [6]. Additionally, it is known, that fluorides (in an aqueous solution) rapidly attact and destabilize aluminium oxide and replace it with aluminium oxyfluoride complexes (or maybe tantalum (V) oxyfluorides in our case) [26,27]. A similar destabilization of the alumina template in the ionic liquid solution could be an additional source of oxides in the deposition bath and lead to a formation of tantalum (V) oxyfluoride complexes [28].Such complexes might degradate the quality of the deposited metallic tantalum layer [28]. To improve the process towards the tantalum. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "metal electrodeposition, more experiments with PAA pretreatment, such as sealing shall be undertaken. Fig. 8 shows the electrodeposition of TaxOy-nanotube arrays via the porous anodic alumina template in steps. From the left to the right the SEM images revealed: (i) PAA template with empty pores, (ii) PAA template filled with Ta-based electrodeposit, (iii) free standing TaxOy-nanotube arrays after etching the PAA template off. After the selective etching of the PAA, each single nanotube was free-standing without any hint of flocking with adjacent tubes. Furthermore, the nanotubes were mechanically tough and well anchored to the bottom layer, see Fig. 9 (iv). After some time of the electrodeposition, the walls of the nanotubes were connected with a thin top layer which grew on the top of the PAA. A very thin top layer had probably accounted for the TaxOy-nanotubes toughness and stability. Fig. 9 shows more SEM images of the TaxOy-nanotubes arrays after selective dissolution of the PAA template. There is a very thin top layer (almost transparent in SEM) over the nanotubes slightly visible in Fig. 9 (iii). A transparent roof over the nanotubes (after etching off the PAA template) was also observed and published in our previous paper, see ref. [8, p.13]. Empty interiors of the nanotubes were revealed in the images of Fig. 9 (i) and (ii). Presumably, the deposits grew as tubes due to a strong surface effect, whereas the edge of pore walls evidently provide advantageous growth sites. The concentration of dissolved Ta in the pores would be rapidly decreased during the deposition and would then be under diffusion control. Higher Ta concentration would probably favour nanorods formation rather than nanotubes. Moreover, after the electroreduction, tantalum metal might interact with some trace moisture/oxygen in the electrolyte forming so the semiconductive TaxOy. The semiconductive TaxOy layer on the walls surface might possibly provide a lower overpotential for further Ta deposition rather than Ta metal together with some other surface effects, e.g., the ionic liquid double layer formation. However, at this point we do not know the exact electrodeposition mechanism. More analyses would be needed to elucidate the possible alumina surface interactions with the given components of the plating solution and their influence upon the electrodeposition. The top-view morphology as well as the 3D topography of the three different specimens (PAA, Negligible-TL and Non-negligible-TL) is shown in Fig. 10 . The surface roughness and the top layer thickness were determined. The average surface roughness values are also present in Fig. 10. The surface became less rough as a consequence of the electrodeposition process. The electrodeposition had a leveling effect on the surface topography. Based on cross-sectional views, see Fig. 8 (ii), the top layer thickness was estimated for about 15 +/\u2212 8\u00a0nm in the case of the Negligible-TL specimen and for about 85 +/\u2212 12\u00a0nm in the case of the Non-negligible-TL specimen. Moreover, top view pores amount analysis was performed by means of the SEM software. There was about 200 pores (considering 5\u00a0\u03bcm view field) in the empty PAA template and the same amount was analyzed also in the Negligible-TL specimen. In the case of the Non-negligible-TL specimen there was only about 30 pores in the same 5\u00a0\u03bcm view field. The top view SEM micrographs are shown in Fig. 11 . In the case of the Negligible-TL specimen the pores were still clearly visible on the surface, whereas most of the pores were already covered in the case of the Non-negligible-TL. In both cases, the top layer was quite inhomogenous and places with exposed pores (without a cover) were found out also in the Non-negligible-TL specimen. The broad range impedance analysis was performed to determine the electrical parameters of both: the PAA template with and without TaxOy-nanotubes. In the first case, the PAA template was not etched off for better manipulation. Equivalent circuits fitting well the experimental data were suggested, see Fig. 12 . Good fit was obtained using a CPE element instead of the capacitance. Effective capacitance C was calculated from the CPE parameters (\u03b1 and Q) using the Hsu and Mansfeld equation (Eq. (2)). For the empty PAA template a capacitance across the alumina C1 (Q1 with \u03b1\u00a0~\u00a01) and a defect resistance of the alumina R2 was considered, see Fig. 12 (i). R1 was the contact electrode resistance. Secondly, PAA containing TaxOy-nanotubes with negligible top layer was considered, where both alumina and TaxOy-nanotubes contacted the gold electrode. Two parallel conduction paths were supposed. The first one was via the PAA and the second one was formed by a Schottky junction Au/Ta2O5 and TaxOy-nanotubes, modelled by: R3-(VR1, C2), ()\u00a0=\u00a0parallel connection, where R3 was the TaxOy-nanotubes resistance. VR1 stands for a voltage-dependent resistance of the Schottky barrier and C2 (Q2 with \u03b12\u00a0<\u00a01) was a Schottky junction capacitance. The equivalent circuit was shown in Fig. 12 (ii). Impedance Bode and Nyquist diagrams of the experimental as well as fitted data were present in Fig. 13 . At first the capacitance and resistivity of the empty PAA template was evaluated. The effective equivalent capacitance was calculated using the R1, Q1 and \u03b11 parameters, acc.to the Hsu and Mansfeld equation (Eq. (2)). PAA revealed a dielectric behavior with a very low deviation from an ideal capacitor, having the alfa parameter of 0.97 and capacitance 10 nF/cm2. Dielectric constant of the empty PAA was determined to 11. Hitzig et al. published the dielectric constant of a PAA to be about 10 [29]. Hence, our result was in a good agreement with that study. The PAA resistivity was determined for about 2.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 \u03a9 cm. Secondly, the Negligible-TL specimen was analysed in detail. The nanotubes resistivity was calculated from the R3 resistance considering an estimated nanotubes wall area (considereing 15 % pores/geometrical area and 4\u00a0nm nanotubes wall thickness), being about 2% of the geometric area. The resistivity of the nanotubes was about 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 \u03a9 cm which would correspond to semiconductive materials, see the classification of electronic conductors according to their electrical conductivity in the book of West [30]. Moreover, the semiconductive behavior of the PAA. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "containing TaxOy-nanotubes specimens was approved by thermal I-V characterization, described bellow. Resistivity of the Schottky junction at zero bias VR1 was estimated as about 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012 \u03a9 cm and its capacitance was about 20 pF. The electrical parameters are summarized in Table 1 . To demonstrate the Schottky diode behavior of our TaxOy-nanotubes films, the I-V characteristic of the Non-negligible-TL specimen was evaluated at room temperature, see Fig. 14 . The I-V curve corresponded to a Schottky diode behavior with clear turn on and breakdown voltages. The Schottky barrier was most probably built between the gold contact electrode and the TaxOy top layer underneath. The notable aspect of the I-V curve was the I-V loop. According to Fleming et al. [31], the loop demonstrated that the current was transient. It means that it had a large time dependence and did not represent a true dc leakage current. More on this will be published later. Thermal characterization of the electrical resistivity was performed on the Negligible-TL specimen at a temperature range 30 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C. The current resulting from application of 1\u00a0V across the sample for 150\u00a0s was used to calculate the resistivity. Fig. 15 revealed the resistivity dependence on temperature, to cover about 2 orders of magnitude. Contrary to metals, the resistivity of insulators and semiconductors decreases with temperature as electrons are thermally-promoted to the conduction band. The total resistivity (Schottky\u00a0+\u00a0nanotubes resistivity) was dominated by the Schottky junction, nevertheless the measurement proved that the electrodeposited material does not behave like a metal conductor (which would lead to a positive resistivity coefficient with temperature). This verified our previous finding that the nanotubes conducted predominantly through non-stoichiometric tantalum oxides and not tantalum metal.  TaxOy-nanotubes were electrodeposited via a porous anodic alumina PAA template using a thermally- and water-stable ionic liquid as the electrodeposition medium. Well-aligned and mechanically stable nanotubes were obtained. Chemical composition and molecular bonds were determined by XPS analyses. The nanotubes were comprised mainly of tantalum pentoxide (main component) but rendered electrically semiconducting by tantalum suboxides (mainly Ta(IV)). Some physisobed LiF and C-F bonds originated from the electrolyte. Annealing the specimens at 800\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 Pa for 6 \u00a0h eliminated fluorine and lithium atoms from the structure. Carbon however remained and formed carbide bonds with tantalum. Coulometry (chronoamperometry) was applied during the electrodeposition experiments to estimate the end of the pores filling. Moreover, it enabled us to control the electrodeposition process in order to get different length of the nanotubes. The maximal length of the nanotubes was defined by the PAA pores length. We produced nanotubes up to 900\u20131000\u00a0nm long with diameters of about 100\u00a0nm. To fill in the pores with the TaxOy-nanotubes took less than one minute. A compact TaxOy top layer over the nanotubes was formed at slightly longer deposition times. Nevertheless, the deposition never took longer than 5 \u00a0min. In some cases, SEM micrographs revealed a very thin top layer. We supposed that even a very thin top layer stabilized the nanotubes so, that they would not collapse after etching away the PAA template. Multiple PAA templates with incorporated TaxOy-nanotube arrays were electrodeposited. Detailed SEM analysis proved that we were able to prepare specimens with diverse top layer thicknesses. The thickness of the top layer was estimated for two samples. The top layer was designated as negligible (having the thickness of about 15 +/\u2212 8\u00a0nm) and non-negligible with thickness of about 85 +/\u2212 12\u00a0nm. The morphology of the negligible top layer specimen was clearly distinguished from an empty PAA template. Although the pores were still visible, their diameter had shrunk due to the electrodeposition of the TaxOy-nanotubes. In contrast, for the sample with 85\u00a0nm top layer, almost all of the PAA pores were sealed. In both specimens the top layer was not compact over the whole surface area, most probably due to the uneven surface of the PAA template, having an average roughness of about 23\u00a0nm. Electrical parameters of the empty PAA and Negligible-TL specimens, such as resistivity and capacitance were analysed by impedance spectroscopy. Electrical circuits fitting well the impedance data were suggested. The dielectric capacitance of the empty PAA was about 10 nF/cm2. Consequently the dielectric constant of the PAA was calculated as about 11. Moreover, the defect resistivity of the PAA was about 2.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 \u03a9 cm. We were able to estimate also the TaxOy-nanotubes resistivity, which was about 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 \u03a9 cm. Additionaly the thermal characterization of the Negligible-TL specimen revealed resistivity dependence on the temperature up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on the magnitude of resistivity and its thermal behavior, the TaxOy material could be classified as semiconducting. It is known that unlike insulators, semiconductors and metals might be prepared by the electrodeposition technique. The electrical analyses and XPS contradicts the presence of tantalum metal within the electrodeposited nanostructures. Additionally, we observed that the behavior of our structure is similar to a Schottky diode (based on I-V measurements), typical for metal/semiconductor junctions. Voltage-dependent resistivity VR as well as a capacitance of the Schottky junction were evaluated at zero bias as well. The parameters equaled to 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012 \u03a9 cm and 20 pF, respectively. Finally, we might conclude that a success of this work would allow for further development of electrochemistry-based technology for nanostructured electronic devices, such as capacitors with superior characteristics, chemical sensors and switching or memristic elements.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Furthermore, with the development of electronic technology, there is an urgent need to develop new indium-free and easy-to-handle TCE materials for future flexible optoelectronic devices. The most popular TCEs materials to date are transparent conductive oxides (TCO). Particularly, due to the excellent transparent conductive performance (10\u201320 \u03a9/sq at 85\u201390% transmittance), indium tin oxide (ITO) is a most widely used TCE materials in the above-mentioned applications . However, ITO suffer from major limitations such as high cost of indium, high temperature processing for deposition and inherent brittleness, which restrict ITO's application to the next-generation flexible and low-temperature processible optoelectronic devices . Therefore, searching potential replacement for ITO as new flexible easy-to-handle TCEs material is necessary for future optoelectronic devices. As a direct wide band gap n-type semiconductor material, ZnO is investigated as the most promising TCO material to replace ITO, for its nontoxicity, low cost and stability in hydrogen plasma. Moreover, doped ZnO shows excellent electrical conductivity, high transmittance in visible spectral range. Many groups have reported the metal cations as common dopants for n-type ZnO, such as B, Al, Ga . However, reports about the nonmetal anion dopant are very limited. In particular, fluorine (F) is a promising anion doping candidate owing to its ionic radius similar to that of oxygen. The most important advantage of F-doped ZnO (FZO) thin films over the metallic cation doped films is that when fluorine substitutes for oxygen, the electronic perturbation is largely confined to the filled valence band and the scattering of conduction electrons is reduced, which could lead to high electron mobility as well as low absorption loss . Hu et al. reported fluorine doped ZnO thin films grown with CVD technique on glass substrate at 350\u2013470 \u00b0C, with electrical resistivity of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm and carrier concentration of 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22123. Ye's group prepared high-performance FZO film on glass at 300 \u00b0C by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), with electrical resistivity of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03a9 cm and Hall mobility of 23.8 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 . Ravichandran et al. investigated the effects of thickness and annealing on electrical and optical properties of double layered TCO films like FTO/AZO, ATO/AZO, FTO/FZO and obtained novel TCO films that possess good figure of merits along with good chemical and thermal stabilities. Maldonado et al. developed novel fluorine and zirconium co-doped ZnO TCO films and reported a minimum resistivity of 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03a9 cm by optimizing growth conditions. Therefore, FZO has practical advantages of excellent transparent conductive performance, availability of cheap large-area application and strong resistance to radiation, which indicates broad applications. Although doped ZnO has shown good transparent conductive performance, its electrical conductivity has an inherent limit due to the dopant concentration limitation. Furthermore, the increase of carrier concentration will inevitably enhance the possibility of ionized impurity scattering at the same time with a result of low carrier mobility. Therefore, single-layer TCOs still cannot fulfill all requirements of many industry device applications due to these restrictions. In order to improve the conductivity and durability of flexible TCEs, a TCO layer can be deposited on a thin metal layer to form a multilayer structure. Compared with single-layer films, multilayer structure can solve some intrinsic problems, e.g. the low transparency of single thin metal film and the conductivity limitation of single TCO film. It has much lower sheet resistance and thinner thickness. Now, a three-layer dielectric\u2013metal\u2013dielectric composite structure has been adopted . However, compared with dielectric\u2013metal\u2013dielectric structure, reports on dielectric\u2013metal bilayer structure are very limited. Dielectric\u2013metal bilayer can significantly reduce the cost, save material resources and be suitable for mass production. Also, there are many reports on Ag film as metal layer for multilayer structure, since it has the lowest resistivity in all metal . However, Cu is a compromise due to its fairly comparable resistivity and much lower price. Primary study on the transparent conductive properties of Cu/ZnO multilayer structure indicates the Cu layer thickness is a key factor . Hence, in this work, we present several new efforts to produce fully indium-free flexible Cu/FZO composite electrodes. First, we grew single-layer FZO TCEs on PET by PLD and studied the effect of oxygen partial pressure on the transparent conductive properties of the single-layer TCEs. Then, we grew fully indium-free flexible Cu/FZO composite electrodes using FZO/PET as substrates at room temperature. The optimal Cu/FZO composite electrode shows resistivity of 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03a9 cm with carrier concentration of 1.11 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22123 and mobility of 8.52 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. The role of Cu layer and effect of its thickness on the transparent conductive properties of composite TCE were discussed. At last, the stretchable and flexible performances of the Cu/FZO film based composite electrodes were tested for the first time to my knowledge.  Cu and FZO layers were deposited on PET substrates by PLD and high-vacuum thermal evaporation method at room temperature, subsequently. Sintered ZnO (99.99% purity, Alfa) containing 1 at% ZnF2 (99.995% purity, Alfa) was used as PLD target and Cu powders (99.99% purity, Alfa) were used as heated source, respectively. The PET substrates were first washed with alcohol to remove some visible impurities. Then plasma cleaning (PDC-32G-2, Harrick) for one minute was employed to eliminate organic impurities. Cu layers with different thickness were grown on PET substrates and 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa chamber pressure. Then, a thin film of FZO was deposited on Cu layer. The FZO film was prepared at 1 Pa oxygen pressure with a KrF excimer laser of 5 Hz and 180 mJ (Coherent, Compex205). The distance between substrate and target was fixed at 6 cm. Similar FZO films on cleaned PET substrates were also prepared under various oxygen pressures from 0.1 to 5 Pa for growth condition optimization. In this work, the thickness of the copper buffer layer was. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "changed from 3 nm to 50 nm and the thickness of the FZO layer was kept at 250 nm for the Cu/FZO multilayer structure. Morphology and crystal structure studies of the Cu/FZO multilayer structure were performed with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Quanta 250, FEI), and X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8-Advance, Bruker), respectively. The transmittance spectra were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu) equipped with an integrating sphere. Mechanical performance was measured on home-made stretching test system and bending test system to clarify stretchable and flexible characteristics of the Cu/FZO multilayer. The sheet resistances were measured by four-point probe method with a source/meter (Keithley 2162A) and probe station (ECOPIA, ESP300).  Fig. 1 shows the surface and cross-section SEM images of the FZO films grown on PET substrate at room temperature. All the FZO films of different thickness have relatively compact and smooth surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The cross-sectional SEM images show very dense columnar grained structure perpendicular to the PET substrates, as shown in Fig. 1(b\u2013d), which indicate the FZO film thickness is 250 nm, 400 nm and 600 nm, respectively. To optimize the PLD growth condition, FZO film of 600 nm, taken as an example, were grown at different oxygen pressure. Fig. 1(e) shows XRD patterns of single FZO films deposited at different oxygen pressure. The XRD peaks at 34.5\u00b0 correspond to ZnO (0 0 2) planes with hexagonal wurtzite structure [JCPDS 36-1451], indicating that the FZO films have a preferred orientation with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrates. When the oxygen pressure was 1 Pa, the FZO (0 0 2) peak was much stronger with a narrower full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.275\u00b0. Fig. 2(a) shows the resistivity and Hall mobility as a function of film thickness for single FZO thin films grown on PET substrates with 1 Pa oxygen pressure. With the FZO film thickness increasing, the resistivity of the films decreases. This is mainly ascribed to the increase of Hall mobility as shown in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(b) shows the variation in resistivity (\u03c1), carrier concentration (n), and Hall mobility (\u03bc) as a function of oxygen pressure for single-layer FZO film of 600 nm. The resistivity is strongly influenced by the oxygen pressure during the film growth. As the oxygen pressure increases from 0.1 to 1 Pa, the resistivity of the films decreases rapidly from 5.36 \u00d7 10\u22123 to the minimum value of 2.02 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03a9 cm, with a carrier concentration of 2.47 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22123, and a Hall mobility of 12.5 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. Then it increases with a further pressure increase to 5 Pa. The electrical properties of 250 and 400 nm FZO films show similar trend with oxygen pressure change. Both the XRD and resistivity data indicate that 1 Pa is the optimized chamber pressure for such film growth that we adopted for the following study. Such single FZO thin films on PET substrates were grown at room temperature, to our best knowledge, for the first time. Moreover, the optimal electrical properties obtained here are comparable with some previously reported FZO films prepared by other techniques with high-temperature process on glass substrates . Resistivity is proportional to the reciprocal of carrier concentration and mobility. Therefore, the change in resistivity with oxygen pressure is attributed to the change in carrier concentration and/or mobility, which are characteristic parameters reflecting the film structure and/or the impurity contents . As can be seen in Fig. 2(b), the initial decrease in resistivity can be ascribed to increase in carrier concentration and Hall mobility. The possible reason is that, as the oxygen pressure increases from 0.1 to 1 Pa, crystallinity and stoichiometry are improved with the reduction of lattice structural disorders formed in severe oxygen deficiency condition, consequently resulting in the increase of both carrier concentration and mobility . With a further increase of oxygen pressure up to 5 Pa, the rapid resistivity increase is mainly attributed to the reduction of carrier concentration and Hall mobility. This can be explained by the fact that the increase in oxygen pressure in this range will produce some adsorbed oxygen occupying grain boundary position. The adsorbed oxygen will trap electrons, increase the barrier height, and enhance electron scattering, consequently result in the decrease in carrier concentration and mobility . Fig. 3 shows the transmission spectra in the wavelength range of 350\u20132000 nm for single FZO thin films grown at various oxygen pressures. All the single films exhibit an average optical transmittance of higher than 90% and a sharp fundamental bandgap absorption edge in the ultraviolet range of 350\u2013400 nm. Particularly, the high transmittance of our single-layer FZO thin films can keep nearly constant for a broad spectral range from 300 to 2000 nm, which is better than AZO showing strong absorption in infrared region . This can be expected to improve the utilization range of solar irradiation when applied as the window layer of solar cell. Also, this characteristic of our single FZO thin films makes it possess the potential ability to completely apply to Cu/fluorine doped ZnO composite transparent conductive electrodes. The figure of merit (FOM) is a parameter commonly used to evaluate transparent conductive electrodes, which applies to optimize electrode designs . The FOM is usually calculated with the sheet resistance (R s) and optical transmittance (T) at a wavelength of 550 nm as defined by Haacke FOM=T10Rs Fig. 4 shows the plots of FOM values and the measured transmittance at \u03bb = 550 nm versus R s for FZO thin films. As we can see, the FOM value first increases from 1.76 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22123, and then decreases to 0.0061 \u00d7 10\u22123 with the increase of oxygen pressure. As the oxygen pressure increases from 0.1 to 1 Pa, the FOM value increases due to the sheet resistance decreases rapidly from 89.4 to the minimum value of about 33.6 \u03a9/sq. However, the FOM value decreases rapidly with the oxygen pressure further increasing from 1 to 5 Pa. This is mainly. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "due to the fast sheet resistance increase but the transmittance only shows small increase. Although 600 nm FZO film shows smaller resistivity, to save materials and deposition cost for large scale device applications, thinner FZO film with proper resistivity is preferred for constructing composite film. So, in the following study, we select 250 nm FZO layer as the base film to optimize the Cu/FZO TC performance by changing the thickness of Cu layer. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of Cu/FZO composite TCEs with different Cu thickness. All Cu/FZO composite films only exhibit ZnO (0 0 2) XRD peaks besides the wide peak from the PET substrate. No additional XRD peaks from the underlying copper film are observed. It also excludes the possibility of any extra phases in the Cu/FZO composite films. With Cu layer thickness increasing, the (0 0 2)-peak intensity of Cu/FZO composite films generally becomes weak. But, the FWHM of (0 0 2)-peak initially decreases and then increases with increase in Cu layer thickness. This means the Cu film with an (1 1 1)-orientation at 7 nm can improve the FZO (0 0 2) orientation. Our former paper have proved that (1 1 1)-oriented Au film can lead to the formation of (0 0 0 2)-oriented ZnO nuclei with a result of oriented nanorod array growth. Although the effect of Cu buffer layer on FZO film can be explained similarly, more detailed study is needed. Fig. 6 displays the dependence of electrical properties for Cu/FZO (250 nm) composite TCEs on the Cu layer thickness. As we can see, the resistivity decreases drastically from 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03a9 cm for single-layer FZO film (250 nm) to 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03a9 cm for Cu/FZO composite films with 3\u201312 nm Cu layers. If the Cu layer thickness further increases, the resistivity decreases only slowly to 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 for the Cu(50 nm)/FZO(250 nm) bilayer. But, if the Cu layer is too thick, e.g. 50 nm, the composite film becomes not transparent. More discussion will be found based on the transmittance spectrum of Fig. 8 . The resistivity decrease with Cu layer thickness can be attributed to the change of carrier concentration and mobility, as shown in Fig. 6. With the Cu layer thickness increasing, the carrier concentration increases. For example, the carrier concentration of the Cu(12 nm)/FZO(250 nm) bilayer film increases by another three orders of magnitude to 1.11 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22123. The increase in carrier concentration can be understood by the carrier injection from Cu layer into FZO layer since the work function difference between Cu and FZO. Copper has a work function of \u03a6 \u2248 4.5 eV and FZO has a work function of \u03a6 \u2248 4.85 eV , as shown in Fig. 7 . When a copper layer contacts with a semiconducting n-type FZO layer with a higher work function, an Ohmic contact is formed at the metal-oxide interface with an accumulation of majority carrier electrons in the FZO layer . This leads to significant injection of carriers from Cu into FZO layer and the substantial increase in conductivity of the bilayer structure although the mobility of Cu(3 nm)/FZO composite film declines compared with single FZO layer. The decline in mobility at this Cu thickness can be explained by the fact that such thin Cu layer is formed by discontinuous islands acting as scattering sites, which will reduce the mobility of the bilayer film . However, the increased mobility of thicker Cu layer sample is due to the discontinuous islands are becoming larger and distance between islands is becoming smaller with a result of weak scattering. For the Cu(12 nm)/FZO(250 nm) bilayer, the carrier concentration increases to the 1022 cm\u22123 order, which suggests that the Cu layer becomes continuous . The transmission spectra in the wavelength range from 350 to 2000 nm were measured for single-layer Cu films and Cu/FZO (250 nm) bilayers with various Cu layer thicknesses, as shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . We measured the transmission spectra until to wavelength of 2000 nm for the Cu film-based composite electrodes. The optical transmittance of single-layer FZO film is above 90% over the visible range of wavelengths and the high transmittance can keep to the near infrared wavelength. Upon insertion of the copper layer, the transmittance of the Cu/FZO (250 nm) composite films drops to 45\u201380%, as shown in Fig. 8. Furthermore, the transmittance decreases with the Cu layer thickening for shorter (300\u2013700 nm) and longer (1300\u20132000 nm) wavelength ranges. However, the transmittance in the middle wavelength range (700\u20131300 nm) decreases firstly and then increases with the Cu layer thickening. In the shorter wavelengths, the decrease in transmittance for Cu/FZO (250 nm) bilayer can be attributed to the interband light absorption, in particular, due to the excitation of electrons from the d-band to the Fermi surface . As the Cu layer thickens, there are more electrons available for excitation due to the electron concentration increases, as can be seen in Fig. 6, which results in the transmittance decreasing. In the longer wavelengths, the transmittance decreases firstly with the Cu layer thickening from 0 to 9 nm, due to discontinuous islands scattering losses in Cu layer. The Cu/FZO bilayer transmittance then increases when the Cu layer thickness is over 12 nm. However, the transmittance decreases as the Cu layer further thickens due to higher light reflectance mainly affecting the transmittance in the longer wavelength . In particular, we find that FZO layer have anti-reflection effect for Cu/FZO (250 nm) bilayers in the wavelength range of 650\u20131000 nm compared with the transmittance spectra of single-layer Cu films shown in Fig. 9. This anti-reflection effect can improve the utilization range of light when applied as the window layer of the solar cell. As shown in Fig. 10 , the transmittance of the Cu/FZO (250 nm) bilayer at wavelength of 550 nm is plotted against the respective sheet resistance. As expected, the transmittance increases when a thinner Cu layer is deposited. But the composite TCE. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "has a bigger sheet resistance. By tuning the Cu layer thickness (12 nm), we can achieve a sheet resistance as low as 2.64 \u03a9/sq. Mechanically foldable and stretchable TCEs are prerequisite for flexible electronics. We then studied the stretchable performance of Cu/FZO composite electrodes with stretching ratio changing from 0 to 5%, to our best knowledge, for the first time. Fig. 11 shows the in-situ SEM images of Cu/FZO films under mechanical pull. As the stretching ratio is lower than 1%, the Cu/FZO (250 nm) bilayer only shows a small deformation, and no microcracks. The average sheet resistance of Cu/FZO (250 nm) bilayer almost shows no change. However, as the stretching ratio increases to 2\u20135%, more microcracks appear, as shown in Fig. 11(c\u2013d). Moreover, when the stretching ratio is 5%, the Cu/FZO bilayer electrical conductivity becomes significantly lower as compared in Fig. 12 , which maybe fail to apply on the stretchable devices to allow for efficient charge extraction/injection. The flexibility and stability of TCEs are also two important properties for long-life flexible electronics. Fig. 13 shows the flexibility test results of the Cu/FZO composite electrode, and commercial ITO film on PET substrates (35 \u03a9/sq at 85% transmittance) bought from Kaivo Optoelectronic Company. The bending test is carried out for 1000 times at a frequency of 1 Hz and with a bending length and radius of 15 mm and 5 mm, respectively. The ITO film changes by 473% after ten bending cycles and, clearly, it fails to maintain the flexibility. In contrast, the composite electrode exhibits a stable electrical performance, even after more than 1000 bending tests. Its ability to endure hundreds of cycles of mechanical bending test is due to the ductile copper layer beneath the FZO in our proposed structure, which helps to retain the electrical properties after bending text .  In conclusion, fully indium-free transparent and conductive Cu/FZO bilayer composite electrodes with stretchable performance were prepared at room temperature on flexible substrates. By optimizing the oxygen pressure, we obtained single FZO layers with the resistivity of 2.02 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03a9 cm on PET by PLD. Also we investigated the structural, electrical, and optical properties of Cu/FZO bilayer electrode of different Cu layer thickness. As the Cu layer thickness increases, the resistivity decreases, mainly due to the increased carrier concentration via electron injection from Cu layer into FZO layer. The lowest resistivity of 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u03a9 cm with a carrier concentration of 1.11 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22123 and mobility of 8.52 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 was obtained at the optimum Cu (12 nm) layer thickness. Moreover, we studied their stretchable performance under mechanical pull, flexible and stable performance by bending test. These results indicate that the double layered Cu/FZO electrode prepared at room temperature might serve as a desirable candidate for the next generation of transparent and flexible electrodes.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2022.154951.txt", "paper": ["Recently, hydrogen gas has drawn much attention as an alternative energy carrier to fossil fuels due to its high gravimetric energy density and no CO2 emission [1]. However, most hydrogen energy is produced through steam reforming of natural gas, emitting significant amount of CO2 gas [2]. Although electrochemical water splitting (EWS) has been extensively studied in recent years as an eco-friendly method of producing hydrogen, the high electricity consumption retards its commercialization [3]. In particular, the sluggish kinetic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH\u2212 \u2192 O2\u00a0+\u00a02H2O\u00a0+\u00a04e\u2212, 1.23\u00a0V vs. RHE) specifically becomes the bottleneck process carrying a high electric energy burden in EWS [4,5]. Various attempts have been made to determine less energy consuming anode reactions such as urea [6\u20138], methanol [9], ethanol [10], primary amines [11], benzyl alcohol [12], tetrahydroisoquinolines [13], and hydrazine [14,15]. Among these, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has received remarkable recognition owing to the significantly low theoretical oxidation potential (HzOR, N2H4\u00a0+\u00a04OH\u2212 \u2192 N2\u00a0+\u00a04H2O\u00a0+\u00a04e\u2212, \u22120.33\u00a0V vs. RHE). Another advantage of HzOR is the generation of N2 gas as the only byproduct of gas evolution. Thus, a membrane for gas separation is not required in overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) owing to the no possibility to react H2 and N2. Because of their high activity and stability, various noble metal-based electrocatalysts have been applied to drive HzOR. Rh-, Ir-, and Ru-based electrocatalysts are reported to exhibit high performances through electronic structure tailoring to optimize the adsorption energy [16]. Furthermore, noble metal phosphide electrocatalysts are known to demonstrate improved HzOR activities. Zhao et al. elucidated the superior activity and stability of Rh2P nanosheets caused by decreasing the energy required for the dehydrogenation of N2H3, which was the key rate-determining step in the reaction [17,18], RuP2 has also exhibited outstanding HzOR activity by changing the rate-determining step [14]. However, noble metal catalysts have limitations in scaling up because of their expensive costs and low reserves on the earth. Recently, non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts have been suggested as alternative cost-effective electrocatalysts [19]. In particular, Co-based electrocatalysts are garnering considerable attention because of their high catalytic activity, outstanding structural stability, simple preparation process, and low costs [16,20\u201323]. Zhang et al. elucidated improved HzOR activity of the Co-based electrocatalyst through nanostructure of metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) [24]. Liu et al. reported the co-doping effect of P, W on Co3N, which changed the potential determining step from N2H2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2H to N2 desorption [25]. In the present study, an array of CoFeP nanowires (NWs) is introduced as a novel HzOR catalyst. Our CoFeP NW catalyst was designed using two strategies: improving the intrinsic activity by employing Fe-doped CoP and enhancing the extrinsic activity resulting from the NW structure. Liu et al. reported that the doping of Fe on CoS2 effectively reduced the free-energy change of N2H4 dehydrogenation, which was considered as rate-determine step [26]. The Fe doping strategy for enhancing the intrinsic activity is expected to lower the energy required for the rate-determine step. The NW structure of CoFe provides extensive surface reaction sites and a rapid unidirectional electron pathway from the nanostructure. Our CoFeP NW array was directly synthesized on a Co foam (CF) through cation exchange and subsequent phosphorization. The NW structure was derived from ZnO NW grown on CF, which was used as a gas-phase cation exchange conversion template to synthesize CoFeO NW [27]. CoFeO NW array was successfully converted into CoFeP NWs after phosphorization. CoFeP/CF exhibited high electrocatalytic performance for HzOR under 1.0\u00a0M KOH and 0.1\u00a0M hydrazine, recording a low potential of \u22127 mV to generate a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, which was superior to that of Pt/CF. In addition, CoFeP/CF demonstrated a low Tafel slope of 29\u00a0mV dec-1 and a high double layer capacitance of 41 mF cm\u22122. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the change in the intrinsic activity of CoP due to Fe doping based on the reaction mechanism study. Fe doping on CoP changes rate determine step of degradation of hydrazine, required less energy of 0.17\u00a0eV. Overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) of Pt/CF-CoFeP/CF exhibited higher activity with a low cell potential of 63\u00a0mV to generate a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122. An assembly of Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF OHzS electrodes combined with a perovskite solar cell (PSC) demonstrated a self-powered solar hydrogen production system. The OHzS system can be operated with a single PSC because of its low power requirement. Our PSC\u2013OHzS system generates an extremely high photocurrent density of 23\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and a Faraday efficiency of approximately 98.6 %. The hydrogen generation rate is two times higher than that of a two-series PSCs driven OWS system, which records a solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 13.1%.  The Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O (zinc nitrate hexahydrate), NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide, 28\u00a0wt% NH3 in water), CoCl2 (cobalt (\u2161) chloride), FeCl3 (iron (III) chloride) and NaH2PO2\u22c5H2O (sodium hypophosphite monohydrate) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Reagent Co, Ltd. The cobalt foam (CF) was obtained from MTI Korea. The CF was sonicated for cleaning in acetone, ethanol, hydrochloric acid and DI water for10 min successively before synthesis of catalysts. The ZnO was first synthesized on CF using a hydrothermal method. For the growth of ZnO NWs, a ZnO seed layer was grown on CF by RF-magnetron sputtering. The ZnO seed-layer/CF was then immersed in a 10\u00a0mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate solution containing ammonium hydroxide, which was heated at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h [28]. The prepared ZnO NWs/CF was rinsed with DI water and then dried in atmosphere. The CoFeO NWs/CF were obtained through a cation exchange of ZnO NWs/CF. For this cation exchange reaction, 1\u00a0g of CoCl2 and 1\u00a0g of FeCl3 were placed at upstream in the two-zone furnace and the ZnO NWs/CF was placed downstream 5 apart from upstream. The two-zone furnace was heated at 800\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min and cooled down in atmosphere. The CoFeP NWs/CF sample was produced by phosphorization of CoFeO NWs/CF. For the phosphorization CoFeO NWs/CF was heated with 1\u00a0g of NaH2PO2\u22c5H2O in a two-zone furnace at 500\u00a0\u00b0C (upstream) and 800\u00a0\u00b0C (downstream) for 2\u00a0h with Ar gas purging and then cooled down in atmosphere. The phosphine (PH3). but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "gas was generated during heating by decomposition of NaH2PO2 [29]. CoP NWs/CF was synthesized by the same method as CoFeP NWs/CF without FeCl3 during cation exchange. FeP NWs/CF was synthesized by the same method as CoFeP NWs/CF without CoCl2 during cation exchange. The 30\u00a0nm thick Pt film was grown on CF by RF sputtering to prepare Pt/CF sample. X-ray diffractometer (D/Max-2500, RIGAKU) equipped with CuK\u03b1 radiation source was employed to obtain the diffraction patterns for crystal structure analysis. Morphology of the samples was investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7800F Prime with Dual EDS, JEOL Ltd) and detailed structure analysis was performed using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2200FS with image CS-corrector, JEOL). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ECSALAB 250, VG scientific) was used to investigate the chemical binding states of the samples. The electrochemical properties of the catalyst samples were measured using a potentiostat (CHI760E, Ivium technology) in a three-electrode configuration with graphite (counter) electrode and Hg/HgO (reference) electrode. The reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was used for conversion in all measurements by using the relation: ERHE\u00a0=\u00a00.0591\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0pH (14.1)\u00a0+\u00a0Ereference (0.115)\u00a0+\u00a0Emeasured. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed at scan rate of 5\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121, which were IR-corrected with solution resistances. Before each LSV measurement, catalyst activation was conducted for 50 cycles ranged from 0 to 0.4 VRHE. For the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, the frequency 0.1\u00a0Hz to 100\u00a0kHz was employed at potential. OHzS reaction was processed in a close packed flask for faradaic efficiency measurements. The product gas from OHzS reaction was analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC 7890B series, Agilent technology, Mol sieve 5A column, SUPELCO), which was collected with a syringe (100\u00a0\u03bcL, Hammilton). Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out with projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [30] using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) [31] version 5.4.4. The generalized gradient approximation with revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional [32] and D3 dispersion correction [33] were employed to describe exchange\u2013correlation effects of interacting electrons and van der Waals interactions, respectively. A plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 450\u00a0eV was used and the convergence criteria for electronic and ionic iterations were set to 10\u22125 eV and 0.02\u00a0eV/\u00c5, respectively. The 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 Monkhorst-pack k-point grids were employed to sample the Brillouin zone. Dipole correction was applied to the potentials and forces. The solvation effects were approximated using the implicit solvation model that solves the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation as implemented in the VASPsol [34]. To calculate the free energy change (\u25b3G) of each reaction step at room temperature (298\u00a0K), the enthalpy, entropy, and zero-point energy were computed based on the vibrational frequencies as in previous studies [35,36]. Additional details are provided in the supporting information. Our PV-EC\u2019s performances were evaluated using both solar simulator (Sun 3000, Abet technology) and potentiostat (CHI760E, Ivium technology) systems. For the fabrication of a perovskite (PSC) solar cell, the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates were used and on the washed FTO glass, tin oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer was spin-coated at 2000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0s using the precursor solution and annealed at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Before and after the deposition of SnO2 layer, UV-ozone treatment was performed and the SnO2 precursor solution was made with dissolution of SnCl2\u22c52H2O in C2H5OH (0.2\u00a0M). For the deposition of perovskite absorption layer, the precursor was made by solving 1.1\u00a0M lead iodide (PbI2), 0.22\u00a0M lead bromide (PbBr2), 0.2\u00a0M methylamine bromide (MABr), 1\u00a0M formamidinium iodide (FAI) in a solvent (4:1\u00a0vol% of DMF (dimethylformamide):DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)). The prepared precursor solution was then deposited on the SnO2 layer by a two-step spin-coating by 1000\u00a0rpm (10\u00a0s) and 6000\u00a0rpm (20\u00a0s). Before the end of the second step, a drop of 150ul chlorobenzene was put on the substrates and then perovskite film was obtained by annealing at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min. On the perovskite layer, after film annealing, a hole transport layer was prepared by spin-coating of the mixed material (72.3\u00a0mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5\u00a0\u03bcL tBP, 16.23\u00a0\u03bcL Li-TFSI (520\u00a0mg/mL in AN), and 2.3\u00a0mg FK 209 in 1\u00a0mL chlorobenzene) for 5000\u00a0rpm 30\u00a0s. Finally, the perovskite solar cell was made complete by evaporation of\u00a0\u223c100\u00a0nm thick Au electrode with a rate of 1\u00a0\u00c5/s. For overall water splitting (OWS), two perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were combined in a series to supply a sufficient voltage. PV-electrolysis system\u2019s performances are normally evaluated by measuring a solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency, which is obtained using a following relation: STHefficiency%=IopmAcm-2\u00d71.23(V)\u00d7100Psolar(mWcm-2) where Iop is the PV-EC\u2019s operating current density, 1.23\u00a0V is a thermodynamic water splitting potential and Psolar is the solar energy\u2019s power density.  The fabrication of CoFeP nanowires (NWs) is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . Initially, a high dense array of ZnO NWs was grown on Co foam (CF) by hydrothermal method, which was applied as a NW template. Subsequently, CoFeO NWs were synthesized by a cation exchange reaction of ZnO NWs. The Zn atoms exchanged fully with Co and Fe atoms during the cation exchange reaction proceeded in a two-zone furnace. Finally, CoFeP NWs were obtained by phosphorization of CoFeO NWs. The corresponding color changes of the samples were visually confirmed. The NW structure of the products was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2 . The ZnO NWs, applied as a template for the cation exchange reaction, completely covered the porous CF with a diameter in the range of 100\u2013300\u00a0nm and a length above 1\u00a0\u03bcm (ZnO/CF sample in Fig. 2a). The NW structure in CoP/CF, FeP/CF, and CoFeP/CF is observed after the cation exchange and phosphorization reactions, as illustrated in Fig. 2b, c, and d, respectively. For comparison, Pt/CF was prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering; the surface if Pt/CF was fully covered by Pt (Fig. S1). The crystallinity of CoFeP/CF was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the obtained XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2e. The diffraction peaks of the bare CF at 41.5\u00b0, 44.2\u00b0, 47.4\u00b0, 62.7\u00b0 and 76.0\u00b0 were assigned to the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (1 1 0) planes of cobalt (JCPDS No. 05-0727), respectively. Additional. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "peaks at 44.2\u00b0, 51.5\u00b0 and 76.0\u00b0 are were ascribed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of cobalt (JCPDS No. 05-0806), respectively. New peaks were observed for ZnO/CF at 31.4\u00b0, 33.8\u00b0, 35.7\u00b0, 46.8\u00b0, 55.9\u00b0, 61.7\u00b0,66.9\u00b0, 68.1\u00b0, and 75.8\u00b0 after depositing wurtzite ZnO NWs on CF, which were assigned to (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (1 1 2), (2 0 1), and (2 0 2) planes of ZnO (JDCPS No. 36-1451), respectively. After cation exchange, ZnO peaks completely disappear, and new peaks are found, confirming the successful conversion of ZnO into CoO, FeO and CoFeO, respectively (Fig. S4). The XRD peaks of the CoFeP/CF sample at 33.8\u00b0, 39.2\u00b0, 56.6\u00b0, 67.6\u00b0 and 71.0\u00b0 were assigned to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (2 2 2) planes of CoO (JCPDS No. 43-1004), respectively. In addition, the weak peaks at 30.9\u00b0, 35.4\u00b0, 37.7\u00b0, 43.1\u00b0, 53.4\u00b0, 56.9\u00b0, 62.5\u00b0, 74.0\u00b0, and 75.0\u00b0 were ascribed to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (3 3 3), (4 4 0), (5 3 3) and (6 2 2) planes of Co3O4, respectively. These results indicate that the fabrication CoFeP NWs has the bulk crystallinity of CoO and Co3O4. Because energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of Fe and P atoms in CoFeP (Fig. S2), phosphorization was considered to proceed mainly in the surface region of CoFeO. The results obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis also confirmed the presence of surface phosphide atoms in CoFeP. In addition, the phosphides of Co or Fe were not detected by XRD, indicating that the synthesized CoFeP had either an amorphous structure or minute crystallites. The EDS composition ratio of Co:Fe in the CoFeP was 1:0.1, suggesting a Co-rich composition. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was additionally conducted to analyze the quantitative concentration of the atoms, which confirmed the presence of Fe and P atoms. The atomic ratio of Co:Fe in CoFeP was 1:0.156, which was consistent with the EDS results (Table S1). The full conversions of ZnO to CoO, FeO and CoFeO were confirmed by EDS and EELS elemental mapping results showing no Zn residue after conversion (Figs. S3 and S5). A transmission electron microscopy\u2013electron energy\u2010loss spectroscopy (TEM\u2013EELS) analysis was performed to study detailed atomic arrangements and composition of CoFeP (Fig. 2f). Low resolution TEM (LRTEM) image showed that CoFeP had a typical NW structure with a diameter of approximately 200\u00a0nm after the cation exchange and phosphorization of ZnO NWs. Elemental mapping by EELS illustrated that each corresponding element of Co, Fe, and P is well distributed over the CoFeP (Fig. 2g). Additional elemental mapping by EDS also shows a uniform distribution of Co, Fe, P atoms (Fig. S6a). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of CoFeP demonstrated a high crystallinity of Co2P (1 1 1) with interplanar spacing of 0.27\u00a0nm (Fig. 2h). The CoFeP sample shows Co2P (1 1 1) surface with similar lattice fringe spacing at various locations (Fig. S6b\u2013d). These results suggest that Fe dopant does not affect the crystalline lattice structure of Co2P in CoFeP. The CoP/CF, FeP/CF, CoFeP/CF and Pt/CF samples were prepared to evaluate their electrocatalytic HzOR activities. Each sample was tested as the working electrode in a typical three-electrode system. Graphite and Hg/HgO were used as the counter and reference electrodes. Subsequently, hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) was evaluated at a scan rate of 5 mVs\u22121 in the aqueous solution containing 1.0\u00a0M KOH\u00a0+\u00a00.1\u00a0M hydrazine. All potential results were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The potential drop from Ohmic resistance was reduced by iR correction identified from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S7). An equivalent circuit model was presented, which is composed of the solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and constant phase element (CPE), to calculate the Ohmic resistance (Fig. S8). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements of Co foam, FeP/CF, CoP/CF, CoFeP/CF, and Pt/CF suggest a dramatic change in their HzOR activities, as illustrated in Fig. 3 a. Comparing the required potential to generate a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, CoFeP/CF exhibited a higher catalytic activity than CoP/CF, FeP/CF and Pt/CF. The potential of \u22127 mV of CoFeP/CF was lower than that of CoP/CF (162\u00a0mV) and FeP/CF (332\u00a0mV). It is even smaller than Pt/CF (62\u00a0mV). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of CoFeP was also studied, demonstrating an increase in the voltage requirement (1.522\u00a0V) for 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122. This value was higher than that of HzOR by 1.53\u00a0V (Fig. 3b), suggesting a successful OER replacement in low power electrochemical hydrogen generation. The CoFeP/CF exhibits a comparably high catalytic activity in hydrazine oxidation reaction. Comparisons with other recent researches of various catalysts are provided in Table S2. The Tafel slopes of the HzOR catalysts were calculated using the equation V\u00a0=\u00a0a log j\u00a0+\u00a0b (V\u00a0=\u00a0potential, a\u00a0=\u00a0Tafel slope, j\u00a0=\u00a0current density, b\u00a0=\u00a0Tafel constant). The results of the Tafel plots are shown in Fig. 3c. CoFeP/CF had the lowest Tafel slope (29\u00a0mV sec\u22121), which is smaller than that of Pt/CF (37\u00a0mV dec\u22121), CoP/CF (55\u00a0mV sec\u22121) and FeP/CF (273\u00a0mV sec\u22121). The high HzOR performance of CoFeP/CF was expected due to the large surface area of the NW structure. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) from 0.2 to 0.3\u00a0V at various scan rates of 20\u2013100\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121 (Fig. S9a\u2013e). The double layer capacitance (Cdl) results were derived from \u0394j\u00a0=\u00a0Cdl\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0v (\u0394j\u00a0=\u00a0change in current density at 0.25\u00a0V, v\u00a0=\u00a0scan rate). The Cdl value of CoFeP/CF (20.5 mF cm\u22122) was approximately four times larger than that of Pt/CF (3.72 mF cm\u22122), as shown in Fig. 3d. Additionally, the Cdl values of CoP/CF (13.52 mF cm\u22122) and FeP/CF (16.39 mF cm\u22122) was higher than that of Pt/CF and CF (0.32 mF cm\u22122). According to LSV normalized by Cdl, CoFeP/CF shows a higher activity than Pt/CF at high current density due to large surface active area (Fig. S9f) [37]. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "investigate the additional kinetic factors for charge transfer at the interface between the catalytic surface and the electrolyte (Fig. S7). The Nyquist plot of CoFeP/CF demonstrated a smaller semicircle radius compared to that of Pt/CF, indicating a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct). The HzOR stability of CoFeP/CF was examined by CV and chronopotentiometry measurements. The CV test results showed a highly stable performance of CoFeP/CF after 1000 cycles of reaction (Fig. 3e). The activity of CoFeP/CF even improved slightly after 1000 cycles. In chronopotentiometry, initial voltage for generating a constant current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 was \u221250\u00a0mV, which increased to \u221212\u00a0mV after 40\u00a0h of operation (Fig. 3f). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of CoFeP/NF was conducted to examine the chemical binding states before and after HzOR. The XPS profiles for Co 2p, Fe 2p, and P 2p are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The Co 2p spectra of the as-prepared CoFeP exhibited two different binding states of Co peaks, that is, 780.8 and 796.6\u00a0eV originated from Co\u2013O and 778.4 and 793.3\u00a0eV deriving from Co\u2013P, respectively. A single binding state of Fe\u2013O at 711.7 and 725.3\u00a0eV was observed for Fe 2P, while the P 2p spectra indicated the presence of metal phosphide (P\u2013M, 129.3 and 130.3\u00a0eV) and phosphate (133.5\u00a0eV). The Co\u2013P peaks disappeared after the 40-h HzOR, while the Co\u2013O peak intensities increased slightly (Fig. 4a). The Fe 2p spectra showed almost no differences after HzOR (Fig. 4b). In the case of P2p, P\u2013M peak disappeared although the P\u2013O peak remained after the 40-h HzOR (Fig. 4c). This result indicates that P\u2013M is converted into phosphates during HzOR. In addition, Fe does not participate in the electrocatalytic HzOR directly, although it promotes the reaction by arranging the CoP binding state and activity. The SEM image of the CoFeP sample after HzOR suggests no etching or change in the NW structure (Fig. S10). The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was also investigated for CF, CoP/CF, FeP/CF, CoFeP/CF, and Pt/CF. The polarization curves of the LSV measurements are presented in Fig. S11a. The required potential for 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 current density of CoFeP/CF (\u2212170\u00a0mV) had a superior HER activity compared to that of CF (\u2212576\u00a0mV), FeP/CF (\u2212243\u00a0mV), and FeP/CF (\u2212191\u00a0mV). However, Pt/CF exhibited the lowest value of \u221219\u00a0mV. The Tafel slopes of CoFeP/CF, CoP/CF, FeP/CF and Pt/CF are also illustrated in Fig. S11b. CoFeP/CF had a Tafel slope of 104\u00a0mV dec\u22121, indicating a huge gap with Pt/CF of 32\u00a0mV dec\u22121. These results that the HER activity of CoFeP/CF is difficult to substitute for a benchmark Pt/CF performance. In order to understand the role of Fe on HzOR activity, DFT calculations were carried out for both the CoP and CoFeP. Before investigating the reaction mechanism for HzOR, we first calculated the surface free energy diagrams of CoP and CoFeP with different monolayer (ML) coverages of surface O (*O) and surface OH (*OH) as a function of the applied potential to find the equilibrium surface structures under HzOR operating conditions (Figs. S12\u201315, Table 3). As shown in Fig. S16, the most stable equilibrium surfaces for the CoP and CoFeP are 1/3 ML *O and 2/3 ML *OH covered surface and 2/3 ML *O and 1/3 ML *OH covered surface, respectively, at the applied potential around \u22128 mV (vs. RHE). Starting from the most stable surface models, we then calculated the reaction free energy diagram for HzOR on both the CoP and CoFeP. Here we assume that the HzOR consist of two chemical steps (N2H4 adsorption and N2 desorption) and four sequential electrochemical dehydrogenation steps (N2H4\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2H3\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2H2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2H\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2), as shown in Fig. 5 . In case of CoP, we found that the adsorption of N2H4 is thermodynamically unfavorable itself by\u00a0+0.18\u00a0eV and the first electrochemical hydrogenation step of N2H4 to N2H3 is the key rate-determining step (RDS) in HzOR, requiring the free energy cost of\u00a0+0.72\u00a0eV. In contrast, CoFeP strongly stabilizes the adsorption of N2H4 with adsorption energy of \u22121.23\u00a0eV and also leads to the change in RDS to the second electrochemical hydrogenation step of N2H3 to N2H2. Notably, the free energy cost for the second electrochemical hydrogenation step is\u00a0+0.55\u00a0eV. Thus, introducing Fe onto CoP could increase the catalytic activity towards HzOR significantly by changing the RDS to second electrochemical hydrogenation step that requires less energy input. The difference between the free energy costs required for overall HzOR of CoP and CoFeP (0.72\u00a0eV \u2212 0.55\u00a0eV\u00a0=\u00a00.17\u00a0eV) is in good agreement with the difference between experimentally observed potentials of CoP and CoFeP (0.17\u00a0V, Fig. 3a). It is interesting to note that in case of CoFeP the intermediate molecules such as N2H3 and N2H are stabilized by the Fe atom and neighboring Co atom while other intermediates such as N2H4, N2H2 and N2 are stabilized by only one neighboring Co atom. The overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system was fabricated by combining Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF as HER\u2013HzOR electrodes. The OHzS LSV measurement of Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF was compared with Pt/CF\u2013Pt/CF and CF\u2013CF in 1.0\u00a0M KOH\u00a0+\u00a00.1\u00a0M hydrazine (Fig. 6 a). The required potential of Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF was 63\u00a0mV for 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, which outperformed the Pt/CF\u2013Pt/CF activity (76\u00a0mV). The required potential difference became larger at a high current density. The OHzS system required much less potential for 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 compared to the OWS system by 1.57\u00a0V (Fig. 6b), indicating the potential requirement of OHzS for minimal consumption of electrical energy to generate H2. The stability test was conducted for 60\u00a0h using chronopotentiometry at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 (Fig. 6c). Pt/CF-CoFeP/CF showed only a slight increase of cell potential by 95\u00a0mV during 60\u00a0h. These results suggest that our Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF has excellent activity and durability for OHzS. The actual amount of H2 generation by Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF was measured in a closed OHzS system. The gas in the closed system was purged with Ar gas before the reaction and the OHzS reaction was performed at a constant current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 (Fig. 6d). The gas composition was analyzed every 10\u00a0min by gas chromatography. The generated H2 gas linearly increased over the operation time, and the production rate of H2 was 92\u03bc\u00a0mol/hr. The Faradaic efficiency of Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF was approximately 98.6% compared with the theoretical. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "amount. The self-powered hydrogen production without an external power supply is attractive for an eco-friendly and decentralization of hydrogen production. Various energy sources such as solar cell [29,38,39], Zn-air batteries [40], triboelectric nanogenerator [41], and thermoelectric cell [42] have successfully provided preference for hydrogen evolution in previous studies. Among these, solar cell has been applied intensively for producing significant amounts of H2 gas through photovoltaic electrolysis (PV-EC) system. However, the higher cost of the PV cell and precious metal is the major disadvantage of the PV-EC system. Therefore, designing an optimized system for PV-EC is essential for cost-effective H2 production [43]. Perovskite solar cells (PSC) have received significant attention as a next-generation solar cell because of their high efficiency and low cost [44]. Furthermore, PSC is inexpensive compared to the present commercialized silicon solar cell and has high efficiency of 25% and above [45]. The combination of Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF electrodes with the PSC completed the unassisted PV-EC system (Fig. 7 a). The operating condition was predicted through a theoretical intersection between the PV cell and the electrolysis system of I-V curves (Fig. 7b). A single PSC produced a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.8\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and an open-circuit voltage of 1.16\u00a0V under 1 Sun (100 mW cm\u22122). However, the photovoltage of a single PSC cannot provide sufficient electrical potential to drive OWS. Thus, a solar cell structure of approximately two is required for generating sufficient photovoltage over 1.23\u00a0V (Fig. 7a). The theoretical intersection between the two PSCs in series and OWS is predicted at 1.64\u00a0V and 11.3\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 as illustrated in Fig. 7b. In contrast, the OHzS system could operate at a much lower voltage; thus, a single PSC is sufficient to supply the desired photovoltage (Fig. 7a). The theoretical intersection between a single PSC and OHzS was predicted at 0.106\u00a0V and 23.7\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 (Fig. 7b). These results indicate that OHzS PV-EC can generate two times more H2 compared to the OWS PV-EC. The actual PV-EC operation of the PSC and Pt/CF-CoFeP/CF is demonstrated in Fig. 7c. The current density of OWS PV-EC was 10.7\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, which had a solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 13.1%. However, the operating current density with OHzS PV-EC was 23\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, producing approximately two times more amount of hydrogen than OWS. Furthermore, OWS PV-EC showed a rapid efficiency drop during 4000\u00a0s, which is due to the two series cell structure and larger active surface area. Conversely, the stability of OHzS PV-EC was significantly improved over 2\u00a0h with no efficiency drop. For a longer operation, the current density gradually decreased to 20\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 after a 60\u00a0h operation (Fig. S17).  A CoFeP NW catalyst was fabricated by cation exchange and phosphorization of ZnO NWs; the catalyst exhibited high density and crystallinity, which was confirmed by SEM, XRD, TEM and XPS. CoFeP/CF exhibited highly active and robust HzOR electrocatalytic performances in both potential (\u22127 mV) and Tafel slope (29\u00a0mV dec\u20131) in 1.0\u00a0M KOH\u00a0+\u00a00.1\u00a0M N2H4 electrolyte, which was better than the potential (62\u00a0mV) and Tafel slope (37\u00a0mV dec\u22121) of Pt/CF. The high catalytic activity of CoFeP/CF was acquired from both the intrinsic low kinetic reaction barrier and extrinsic large active surface sites. The HzOR of CoFeP/CF required lesser potential than that of OER by 1.53\u00a0V. The combined OHzS system of Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF required significantly low potential of 63\u00a0mV to generate 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122. Furthermore, the actual H2 gas generation was confirmed by gas chromatography with high Faraday efficiencies of approximately 98.6%. A self-powered PV-EC hydrogen production with hydrazine was realized by assembling a single PSC with Pt/CF\u2013CoFeP/CF electrodes. Our PV-EC device produced a high photocurrent density of 23\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 under 1 Sun conditions, producing twice the amount of hydrogen compared to that of OWS PV-EC.

Various technological applications have been identified for such materials, for example in sensors, solar cells, transducers and photocatalysis [1,2]. Zinc oxide (ZnO), a wide band-gap (3.37\u00a0eV) semiconductor with a high exciton binding energy of 60\u00a0meV at room temperature [3], is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material. In several reports [4], ZnO shows better performance than the well-known TiO2, e.g., for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants (particularly dyes [5\u20138]). A substantial part of the research has been targeted to determine the effect of structural properties of ZnO nanocrystals, such as surface area [7,8], particle/crystal size [9,10], crystal orientation [11], crystallinity [9], surface defect [12], facet [10] and aspect ratio (rod length/rod diameter) [13], on photocatalytic activity. However, ZnO nanocrystals in powder form are difficult to recycle from the aqueous solution after reaction and are prone to catalyst deactivation due to agglomeration of particles and/or material loss in the form of very fine particles [7,14]. A practical solution involves the immobilization of ZnO on substrates [15]. Vayssieres et al. reported the growth of well-oriented ZnO nanorods (NRs) and nanowires (NWs) on silicon wafer[16]. Fluorine-doped tin oxide glass, GaN and metal sheets have also been utilized to immobilize ZnO NRs [17\u201319]. To date, most of the fabrication of ZnO NRs is limited to stiff substrates and only a few reports on the assembly of ZnO on flexible substrates (e.g., ZnO nanorod arrays on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) [20], Kapton tape [21], Teflon [22], Indium Tin Oxide film coated on polyethylene terephthalate (ITO/PET) [23], ITO-coated polyether sulfone (PES)[24], polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [25,26] and cotton fabrics [27\u201330]) have been reported. Compared to stiff substrates, flexible ACFs have superior properties such as a large surface area, high chemical inertness and heat resistance. Additionally, carbon materials (e.g., activated carbon) are already known to have a positive and synergistic effect on photodegradation efficiency of supported or mixed ZnO catalysts [8,31\u201334]. Nevertheless, efficient methods to grow well-aligned 1D nanocrystals on ACFs are not well developed. Wang et al. succeeded in assembling TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) [35] onto ACFs by a solvothermal route. ZnO nanotubes [36], ZnO micro/nanomaterials (nanoparticles, nanorods, microsheets and microspheres) [37], ZnO nanorods [38] and ZnO nanorod arrays [39] have been synthesized on carbon fibers via hydrothermal process. Generally, a coating step of carbon fibers with ZnO seed layer (e.g., by RF magnetron sputtering [38]) prior to hydrothermal is required. And this two-step approach to grow ZnO nanorods on stiff substrates (e.g., silicon [40\u201342]) has been extensively reported and summarized [2,43,44]. Here we report an efficient and integrated synthesis approach (Scheme 1 ) to assemble well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays (ZnO NRAs) on the flexible ACFs substrate. The use and recycle of ZnO NRAs/ACFs for photocatalytic degradation of a model dye (methylene blue, MB) in solution were also investigated to demonstrate its promise for photocatalysis application.  Zinc acetate dihydrate, 2-methoxyethanol, monoethanolamine (MEA), zinc nitrate hexahydrate, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), absolute ethanol, methylene blue and ZnO powder were of analytical grade and supplied by the Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., PR China. Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were purchased from the Qinhuangdao Zichuan Carbon Fiber Co., Ltd., PR China. The stepwise assembly of ZnO NRAs on ACFs includes the synthesis of ZnO seed layers (termed as ZnO SLs) via the sol-gel method [45] followed by preparation of ZnO NRAs using an hydrothermal method [16]. Typically, 1.10\u20132.74\u00a0g (viz., 0.1\u20130.25\u00a0mol L\u22121) of zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (50\u00a0mL) followed by the addition of equimolar amounts of monoethanolamine (MEA). The mixture was stirred (400\u00a0rpm) at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The obtained sol was subsequently deposited on the ACFs surface (30\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0mm, Fig. 1 ) by a dip-coating procedure. The as-prepared precursors were dried at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h followed by calcination at 500\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min to form the ZnO seed layers on the ACFs (termed as ZnO SLs/ACFs-x, where x represents the concentration of zinc acetate dihydrate (mol L\u22121) used in the synthesis). Meanwhile, a solution of 0.09\u20130.89 g (viz., 0.01\u20130.1\u00a0mol L\u22121) of zinc nitrate hexahydrate in deionized water (30\u00a0mL) and a solution containing equimolar amounts of hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) in deionized water (30\u00a0mL) were prepared and were well mixed by stirring at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The obtained liquid was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave followed by adding the above synthesized ZnO SLs/ACFs-x. The hydrothermal reaction was conducted at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u20136\u00a0h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was filtered and the filter cake was 5 times rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. The obtained solid was dried at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h to obtain the ZnO NRAs on ACFs (termed as ZnO NRAs/ACFs-x-y-z, where x represents the concentration of zinc acetate dihydrate (mol L\u22121) used for the synthesis of the corresponding ZnO SLs/ACFs-x, y represents the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (mol L\u22121), and z represents the hydrothermal time (h)). For comparison, ZnO nanorods (termed as ZnO NRs) on ACFs were synthesized by following the above hydrothermal procedure using pristine ACFs instead of ZnO SLs/ACFs-x prepared by the sol-gel technique. The sample is denoted as ZnO NRs/ACFs-0-0.025-4, where 0.025 represents the concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (mol L\u22121) and 4 represents the hydrothermal time (h). The textural properties of ACFs, ZnO SLs/ACFs, ZnO NRAs/ACFs and ZnO NRs/ACFs are tabulated in Table 1 . Furthermore, ZnO NRs and ZnO NRAs were peeled off from the corresponding ZnO NRs/ACFs and ZnO NRAs/ACFs samples for the characterizations. ZnO NRs-0-0.025-4 and ZnO NRAs-0.1-0.025-4 were obtained by sonication of the parent ZnO NRs/ACFs-0-0.025-4 and ZnO NRAs/ACFs-0.1-0.025-4, individually. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200, The Netherlands) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, USA) were used to determine the morphology of the samples. At least 100 particles were measured to determine the average diameter and length of the particles and standard deviations. An integrated energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was employed to determine the ZnO content of the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "2200, Japan), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, USA) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, USA) were utilized to determine crystallographic features of the samples. The textural parameters were measured on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 (USA). The samples were degassed at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h under vacuum, followed by nitrogen adsorption and desorption measurements at 77\u00a0K. The optical properties were determined by using photoluminescence (PL, FLS 980, Britain) recorded at room temperature and an excitation wavelength of 325\u00a0nm, and by UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, TU 1901). Photocatalytic degradation of MB was carried out in a jacketed glass batch reactor using a UV lamp (365\u00a0nm, 8\u00a0W) as the light source. The catalyst was added to an aqueous solution of MB, followed by magnetically stirred in the dark for 2\u00a0h at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Subsequently, UV light was introduced to perform the photocatalytic degradation of MB at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for a reaction time of 2\u00a0h. MB concentrations of the solutions after dark adsorption and after photocatalytic degradation were analyzed by UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry (TU 1950). The degradation percentage (\u0273) of MB was calculated by Eq. (1). After the first reaction, the used catalysts were filtered and reused for additional 2 times to test the reusabilities of the catalysts. \u03b7%=1-MBconcentrationafter2-hphotocatalysisdegradationMBconcentrationafter2-hdarkadsorption\u00d7100%  The novel two-step approach to synthesize ZnO NRAs on ACFs includes a pre-coating of the ZnO seed layers (ZnO SLs) on the ACFs using a sol-gel [45] method followed by their growth into ZnO NRAs using a hydrothermal [16] method (see Section 2.2). The chemical reactions involved in the individual sol-gel [46] and hydrothermal [47] steps are well reported and illustrated in Scheme 1. In the initial stage we also explored the use of a hydrothermal method only to prepare ZnO on ACFs. However, it was found that ZnO nanorods (Fig. 2 b) grew randomly on the pristine ACFs surface (Fig. 2a) and partially self-assembled into tufted spheres (Fig. 2b). To overcome this, thin seed layers of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO SLs) were deposited on the ACFs surface (ZnO SLs/ACFs, Fig. 2c, e and g) using a colloidal sol-gel method [45], and further subjected to a hydrothermal procedure. Indeed, this 2-step approach had a very positive effect on obtaining well-aligned ZnO nanorod arrays, which were oriented in a perpendicular fashion on the ACFs surface (ZnO NRAs/ACFs, Fig. 2d, f and h). The ZnO SLs on the ACFs surface obtained after the initial sol-gel method consist of uniformly mono-layer dispersed nanospheres with particle size of 150\u2013250\u00a0nm (Fig. 2c, e and g). The XRD pattern of ZnO SLs/ACFs (Fig. 3 b) exhibits superimposable peaks arising from the ACFs substrate (Fig. 3a) and single crystalline ZnO particles with a hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS No. 36-1451). The intense peak at 2\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a034.4\u00b0 (Fig. 3b) indicates that the ZnO SLs on ACFs show a preferential orientation along the (0\u00a00\u00a02) plane [48]. When applying higher zinc acetate concentrations (e.g., from 0.1 to 0.25\u00a0mol L\u22121) in the sol-gel synthesis step, the concentration of ZnO nanospheres on ACFs surface increases (Fig. 2c, e and g), which is also reflected by a higher ZnO content in the ZnO SLs/ACFs (from 3.6 to 8.0 atom%, Entries 2\u20135, Table 1). When these ZnO SLs/ACFs-x (x represents zinc acetate concentration) with different ZnO contents are subjected to a similar hydrothermal procedure (viz., using the same zinc nitrate concentration of 0.025\u00a0mol L\u22121 and a hydrothermal reaction time of 4\u00a0h), the thus obtained ZnO NRAs/ACFs show similar diameter and length distributions (Fig. S1), which are in the range of 140\u2013260\u00a0nm (centered at 200\u00a0nm) and 2.2\u20134.5\u00a0\u03bcm (centered at 3.0\u00a0\u03bcm), respectively. This leads to an aspect ratio of 15:1 and specific surface areas of 12\u201316\u00a0m2 g\u22121 for ZnO NRAs on the four ZnO NRAs/ACFs-x-0.025-4 samples (Entries 6\u20139, Table 1). However, the concentration of ZnO NRAs on ACFs surface increased from 4 to 13 rods \u03bcm\u22122 (Fig. 4 a). This indicates that the concentration of zinc acetate for the sol-gel synthesis allows control of the ZnO nanorod concentration on the ZnO NRAs/ACFs surface. The concentration of Zn(NO3)2 used for the hydrothermal synthesis step was found to affect the rod diameter (70\u2013900\u00a0nm, Fig. 4b) of the ZnO NRAs as well as the ZnO content (8.2\u201318.4 atom%, Entries 7 and 10\u201312, Table 1) in ZnO NRAs/ACFs-0.15-y-4 samples (y represents zinc nitrate concentration). Higher Zn(NO3)2 concentrations (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.05\u00a0mol L\u22121) led to a significant increase in the diameter of the ZnO nanorods from 70-125\u00a0nm (centered at 90\u00a0nm, Fig. 4b) to 180\u2013400\u00a0nm (centered at 250\u00a0nm, Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the ZnO nanorods prepared at higher Zn(NO3)2 concentrations show a more preferred orientation along the a-axes. This is evidenced by the XRD patterns (Fig. 3b\u2013e), which clearly show higher intensities for the two peaks at 2\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a031.7\u00b0 and 36.2\u00b0, corresponding to (1\u00a00\u00a00) and (1\u00a00\u00a01) planes. Interestingly, the length of the ZnO nanorods is in the range of 2.0\u20134.5\u00a0\u03bcm (centered at 3.0\u00a0\u03bcm) and hardly affected by the Zn(NO3)2 concentrations (Fig. S2). This results in a decrease in the aspect ratio and the specific surface area for the ZnO NRAs on the ZnO NRAs/ACFs surface from 20:1 and 16\u00a0m2 g\u22121 (y\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u00a0mol L\u22121, Entry 10, Table 1) to 12:1 and 6\u00a0m2 g\u22121 (y\u00a0=\u00a00.05\u00a0mol L\u22121, Entry 11, Table 1). Noticeably, a further increase in the Zn(NO3)2 concentration (e.g., higher than 0.05\u00a0mol L\u22121) led to the formation of non-uniform ZnO nanorods and tufted ZnO nanoflowers (e.g., Fig. 5 d). We have also explored the hydrothermal reaction time on the morphology of ZnO nanorods (Fig. 6 ). After 1-h, a layer of ZnO nanocrystalline grains can be identified (Fig. 6a), on which some of the ZnO nanorods have grown. This indicates that the growth of ZnO nanocrystalline grains is dominant and the growth rate of ZnO nanorods is relatively low in the initial period of the hydrothermal synthesis [49]. Extending the hydrothermal time from 1\u00a0h to 3\u00a0h results in more ZnO nanorods on the ACFs substrate (Fig. 6a\u2013c). The XRD patterns of ZnO NRAs/ACFs-0.15\u20130.025\u20133 (Fig. 3g) clearly show higher intensities of the (1\u00a00\u00a00) and (1\u00a00\u00a01) planes compared to the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "parent ZnO SLs/ACFs-0.15 (Fig. 3b), indicating that the growth orientation of ZnO in the initial stage is preferred along the a-axes [50]. After 3\u00a0h, the ZnO nanorods with the diameter range of 80\u2013180\u00a0nm (centered at 120\u00a0nm, Fig. S3-e) and length range of 0.7\u20131.2\u00a0\u03bcm (centered at 0.9\u00a0\u03bcm, Fig. 4c) were uniformly grown on the ACFs substrate (Fig. 6c). Prolonging the hydrothermal time from 3 to 5\u00a0h promotes the growth in the c-axis direction, which is reflected by the increased intensity ratio of the diffraction peak of (0\u00a00\u00a02) plane to those of (1\u00a00\u00a00) and (1\u00a00\u00a01) planes (e.g., Fig. 3h vs. g). This led to a significantly increased length of ZnO NRAs, which was in the range of 2.0\u20138.0\u00a0\u03bcm (centered at 4.5\u00a0\u03bcm, Fig. S3j), while a slightly increased diameter of ZnO nanorods of ZnO NRAs/ACFs, which was in the range of 100\u2013350\u00a0nm (centered at 225\u00a0nm, Fig. S3i). Consequently, the aspect ratio for ZnO nanorods of ZnO NRAs/ACFs-0.15\u20130.025-z (z represents hydrothermal reaction time) remarkably increased from 7.5:1 (z\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0h, Entry 13, Table 1) to 18:1 (z\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0h, Entry 14, Table 1). Contrarily, the specific surface area for the ZnO NRAs of the ZnO NRAs/ACFs-0.15\u20130.025-z was decreased from 20 to 5\u00a0m2 g\u22121 (Entries 13\u201314, Table 1). When the hydrothermal time was prolonged further, e.g., to 6\u00a0h, the aspect ratio of the ZnO NRAs reached 20:1. However, the ZnO NRAs became less ordered (Fig. 6f). The above demonstration has shown the importance to form ZnO seed layers prior to the growth of ZnO nanorod arrays on the flexible ACFs surface. The developed procedure involving the sol-gel and subsequent hydrothermal synthesis allows high control of textural and structural properties of the ZnO NRAs on ACFs substrates. The size and orientation of ZnO nanorods are greatly improved (Fig. 2d, f and h vs. b) by pre-coating the ACFs surface with the ZnO seed layers. The preferred c-axis orientation of ZnO NRAs on ACFs surface is evidenced by the intense (0\u00a00\u00a02) diffraction peak for ZnO NRAs peeled off from ZnO NRAs/ACFs-0.1-0.025-4 as compared to that for ZnO NRs peeled off from ZnO NRs/ACFs-0-0.025-4 (Fig. 3j vs. k). This is likely due to the fact that the terminated (0\u00a00\u00a01) facets of the ZnO seeds (Fig. 3b) formed by the sol-gel synthesis, which are polar and comprised of (0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a01)-Zn surface and (0\u00a00\u00a00\u00a0\u20131)-O surface[2], act as the reactive crystalline facets for the epitaxial growth of ZnO NRAs during the follow-up hydrothermal synthesis step. After the sol-gel synthesis, the ZnO seed layers grow further in the initial stage of the hydrothermal synthesis (1\u20133\u00a0h) via nucleation and surface coverage, resulting in the formation of a layer of ZnO nanocrystalline grains on the ACFs surface (Fig. 6a\u2013c). At longer hydrothermal synthesis times (>3h), the well-aligned NRAs grow very rapidly. The top-view SEM image of ZnO NRAs/ACFs (Fig. S4) reveals that the synthesized ZnO NRAs are hexagonal. The single crystalline nature of the individual ZnO rod of ZnO NRAs from ZnO NRAs/ACFs is clear from the SAED patterns (Fig. 7 ). These observations indicate that after the initial stage of the nucleation and surface coverage (hydrothermal synthesis of 1\u20133\u00a0h), the ZnO NRAs grow rapidly on ACFs surface with a preferential orientation along the [0\u00a00\u00a01] direction. At longer hydrothermal treatment times (e.g., >4\u00a0h), viz., in the continuous growth stage, HMT functions as a nonpolar chelating agent and is preferentially attached to the non-polar facets (e.g., (1\u00a00\u00a00), (1\u00a01\u00a00) and (0\u00a01\u00a00)), preventing the access of the precursor and thus promoting the epitaxial growth along the polar facet (0\u00a00\u00a01) [51]. This preferential epitaxial growth along the c-axis results in the formation of the well-aligned single crystalline ZnO NRAs with hexagonal wurtzite structure on the flexible ACFs surface. A schematic diagram illustrating the growth mechanism of ZnO NRAs on the flexible ACFs substrate is vividly shown in Scheme 1, including the nucleation in sol-gel step, further nucleation and surface coverage in the initial stage (e.g., <3\u00a0h) of hydrothermal synthesis step, and rapid rods growth in the later stage (e.g., >3\u00a0h) of hydrothermal synthesis step. The orientation/morphology, concentration, diameter and length, aspect ratio and surface area of the ZnO NRAs can be tuned by adjusting the synthesis parameters, e.g., concentration of zinc acetate for sol-gel synthesis, concentration of zinc nitrate and hydrothermal reaction time for hydrothermal synthesis. However, the interaction between ZnO nanorods and ACFs surface remains unclear. Presumably, the functional groups on ACFs surface, e.g., OH, C= O, COOH, and amide group [52], may provide the possibility to bind ZnO nanoparticles. To investigate the structural and optical properties of ZnO nanorod arrays grown on ACFs synthesized by the stepwise method developed above, ZnO NRs peeled off from ZnO NRs/ACFs-0-0.025-4 and NRAs peeled off from ZnO NRAs/ACFs-0.15-0.025-4 were characterized by UV\u2013Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, inset of Fig. 8 ) and room-temperature photoluminescence (Fig. 9 ). The DRS spectra (Fig. 8) show that the absorption wavelength are only in the UV region (\u03bb\u00a0<\u00a0400\u00a0nm), in line with ZnO [53] and ZnO NRAs [17] prepared by other synthesis methods. Comparatively, the ZnO NRAs grown on ACFs surface show a stronger absorption peak with a red-shifted absorption edge. In addition, the bandgaps of the three types of ZnO nanocrystals were calculated by the Kubelka-Munk algorithm [54] (Fig. 8) and the values are 3.11\u00a0eV, 3.15\u00a0eV and 3.17\u00a0eV for ZnO NRAs, ZnO NRs and ZnO powder, respectively. The lower energy bandgap and the red-shifted light absorption for ZnO NRAs suggest that ZnO NRAs may possess enhanced optical absorption [17] and induce effective separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers [55] than ZnO NRs and ZnO powder. The room-temperature photoluminescence spectrum of commercial ZnO powder (Fig. 9) shows a sharp excitonic peak centered at 384\u00a0nm, in accordance with the literature [56]. The exciton emission peaks in the UV region for the ZnO NRs and ZnO NRAs grown on ACFs surface are strongly quenched and red-shifted to 405\u00a0nm, likely due to the presence of crystal defects (e.g., Zni), which are supported by their strong deep-level emissions in the visible region (Fig. 9). Compared with ZnO NRs, ZnO NRAs show higher intensities. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of the Zn-related blue emission, O-related green and yellow emissions. The IDLE/INBE for commercial ZnO powder, ZnO NRs and ZnO NRAs are 1.6, 8.3 and 14.4, indicating that ZnO NRAs have the highest defect level. These defects are of importance in photocatalysis to trap the photo-generated electrons and as such to prevent their recombination with the holes. Furthermore, it needs to be highlighted here that the developed two-step sol-gel and hydrothermal synthesis method allows the synthesis of ZnO nanorods with a higher surface area (e.g., 20\u00a0m2 g\u22121 in Table 1 vs. 6\u20138\u00a0m2 g\u22121 reported in Ref. [13] and 4\u00a0m2 g\u22121 for commercial ZnO powder, Table 1) than the conventional synthesis routes. And the assembly of ZnO NRAs on ACFs surface hardly affects the flexibility of ACFs (Fig. 1). The above outstanding structural features (e.g., unique one-dimensional structure, high level of defects and high surface areas) and optical properties (e.g., low bandgap and strong light absorption) of ZnO nanorod arrays grown on the flexible ACFs substrates are preferable for their applications, e.g., in photocatalysis, which is demonstrated here by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) in solution. The dark adsorption/desorption equilibrium of MB over the investigated catalysts was established by performing the dark reaction for 2\u00a0h under stirring. The initial blank photocatalytic experiments showed that the degradation of MB using ACFs without ZnO in the presence of UV light for 2\u00a0h is negligible. ZnO NRAs peeled off from ZnO NRAs/ACFs exhibited a higher MB degradation (47.1%, Entry 9, Table 2 ) than ZnO NRs peeled off from ZnO NAs/ACFs (36.0%, Entry 5, Table 2) and the commercial ZnO powder (31.9%, Entry 1, Table 2). When comparing with ZnO powder, the 1D ZnO nanocrystals (viz., ZnO NRAs and ZnO NRs) with their highly oriented structure are possibly good in capturing light from all directions [15], leading to lower light-losses through surface reflection, which is very advantageous for photocatalytic performance. In addition, the unique one-dimensional structure may also play a role in improving electron transportation and reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron/hole (e\u2212/h+) pairs [57]. For the 1D ZnO nanocrystals, ZnO NRAs show higher MB degradation than ZnO NRs, likely due to the superior structural features and optical properties shown above. Furthermore, it might also be related to the degree of particle anisotropy (indicated by XRD peak intensity ratio of (0\u00a00\u00a02) plane to (1\u00a00\u00a00) plane, termed as I(0\u00a00\u00a02)/I(1\u00a00\u00a00) [10]), which is much higher for ZnO NRAs (I(0\u00a00\u00a02)/I(1\u00a00\u00a00)\u00a0=\u00a01.22) than for ZnO NRs (I(0\u00a00\u00a02)/I(1\u00a00\u00a00)\u00a0=\u00a00.36). It was reported that the OH\u2212 ions prefer to adsorbing onto the (0\u00a00\u00a01) face of ZnO, leading to higher production rates of reactive OH\u00b7 radicals, which consequently enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency [10,13,58]. The above three types of ZnO nanocrystals immobilized on or mixed with ACFs substrates, viz., ZnO NRAs/ACFs, ZnO NRs/ACFs and ZnO-ACFs (of which SEM image is shown in Fig. S5) were also employed for photocatalytic degradation of MB in solution. It needs to be noted here that the ZnO dosages (Table 2) of these catalysts were adjusted to achieve a similar MB concentration (ca. 2\u00a0mg L\u22121) after 2-h dark adsorption. As compared to the corresponding ZnO nanocrystals, an enhanced MB degradation is obtained on ZnO NRAs/ACFs (77.5%, Entry 10, Table 2), ZnO NRs/ACFs (53.1%, Entry 6, Table 2) and ZnO-ACFs (71.6%, Entry 2, Table 2). These results indicate that there exists a synergistic effect between ZnO nanocrystals and ACFs [8,14,31\u201334,59,60]. This synergistic effect may be due to the preferential adsorption of MB on ACFs surface, followed by transfer to the photoactive ZnO particles [32]. The better performance in the presence of ACFs may also be due to the fact that ACFs are highly conductive. As such, the photogenerated electrons are transported through the highly conductive ACFs [59,60], leading to an effective separation of the photogenerated electron/hole (e\u2212/h+) pairs, which enhances the generation of reactive OH\u00b7 radicals for MB degradation. Comparatively, ZnO NRAs/ACFs catalyst shows higher MB degradation (36.5\u00a0mg\u00a0MB\u00a0g\u22121 ZnO) than the mechanically mixed ZnO-ACFs catalyst (23.4\u00a0mg\u00a0MB\u00a0g\u22121 ZnO), considering that ZnO nanoparticles on the catalysts are responsible for catalytic degradation. This indicates that an enhanced synergistic effect between ZnO nanocrystals and ACFs can be obtained via the two-step synthesis for immobilizing the well-aligned ZnO NRAs on ACFs surface. The used ZnO NRAs/ACFs, ZnO NRs/ACFs and ZnO-ACFs catalysts after reaction were filtered and reused for additional 2 times for photocatalytic degradation of MB in solution to examine their reusabilities. As can be seen from Table 2, MB degradations over the reused catalysts (Entries 4, 8 and 12) was significantly decreased as compared to those over the fresh catalysts (Entries 2, 6 and 10). This could be due to a higher MB concentration after 2-h dark adsorption for photocatalytic degradation over the recycled catalysts. The high concentration of MB molecules might compete the light absorption with the catalyst [61], resulting in less light penetration and thus lower catalytic degradation of MB. Nevertheless, the MB degradation over the recycled ZnO NRAs/ACFs (31.6%, Entry 12, Table 2) is three times higher than those over the recycled ZnO NRs/ACFs (7.8%, Entry 8, Table 2) and ZnO-ACFs (10.1%, Entry 4, Table 2) catalysts. The low reusability of the mixed ZnO-ACFs catalysts might be related to the poor separation of ZnO powder [33] resulting in the loss of mass and agglomeration. We also observed that ZnO NRs and microspheres (Fig. 2b) may be easily peeled off from ZnO NRs/ACFs during photocatalytic degradation. Consequently, the superb reusability of ZnO NRAs/ACFs indicates a strong interaction between ZnO and ACFs substrates via the two-step sol-gel and hydrothermal synthesis. The above demonstration confirms the promising application of ZnO NRAs/ACFs in environmental engineering and photocatalysis.  In conclusion, the well-aligned single-crystal wurtzite ZnO nanorod arrays (ZnO NRAs) have been successfully assembled on the flexible activated carbon fibers (ACFs) substrates by a stepwise sol-gel and hydrothermal synthesis method. The growth orientation (e.g., along c-axis), rod concentration (e.g., 4\u201313 rods \u03bcm\u22122), rod diameter (e.g., 70\u2013900\u00a0nm), rod length (e.g., 0.6\u20138.0\u00a0\u03bcm), aspect ratio (e.g., 5\u201320:1) and surface area (e.g., 4\u201320\u00a0m2 g\u22121) of ZnO NRAs are. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "tunable by controlling the concentration of zinc acetate during the sol-gel synthesis step, and the concentration of zinc nitrate and time during the hydrothermal synthesis step. The distinguished structural and optical characteristics of ZnO NRAs grown on ACFs surface and the well-known synergistic effect from ACFs (e.g., superb adsorbility) make this novel ZnO NRAs/ACFs material promising for photocatalysis. Our demonstration of photocatalytic degradation of MB shows that immobilizing ZnO NRAs on ACFs enhances MB degradation on the individual ZnO NRAs and promotes the recyclability for multiple reuses.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apt.2014.07.010.txt", "paper": ["Protection of solar panels and optical systems installed on lunar surface from depositing charged lunar dust is a great concern to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for future lunar, a steroidal and Martian explorations. Charging of lunar dust is due to exposure to intense high energetic solar radiation on the dayside of the moon, as well as exposure to low energetic electrons impingement on the nightside of the moon [1,2]. Astronauts in Apollo 17 mission reported a layer of micron-sized and submicron-sized lunar dust levitated from the surface because of repelling forces between the like-charged particles [3]. This was imaged by the lunar orbiter as a horizon glow over the lunar terminator [4]. Strong adhesion of charged lunar dust to all surfaces, rise and fall cycles of the particles and consequent dust deposition on mission-critical equipment have been studied within the past two decades leading to development of different control technologies. However, only electrostatic- or electrodynamic-based methods seem practical which have gained the most acceptance in the literature [5,6]. Electrodynamic dust shield (EDS) technology introduced by Calle et al. [7] and Kawamoto et al. [8,9] is based on electric curtain concepts developed by Tatom et al. at NASA [10] and Masuda et al. at University of Tokyo [11]. The EDS consists of embedded electrodes inside a transparent insulator film installed on the solar cell surfaces, and it utilizes standing or traveling waves to lift and transport both charged and uncharged particles deposited on the surface. However, according to a study by Qian et al. [12] the rate of electric power required for the EDS operation may be significantly higher than that provided by a solar panel, although the cleaning operation is infrequent. Inspired from industrial electrostatic precipitators (ESP) [13], an electrostatic lunar dust collector (ELDC) was suggested by Afshar-Mohajer et al. [14]. The ELDC provided electric potential between a parallel set of conducting and transparent thin plates normal to the protected surface to attract incoming like-charged particles to the oppositely charged collection plate. The proficiency of the ELDC running at relatively low applied voltage has been investigated numerically (\u223c170 V needed for 100% collection efficiency of 20 \u03bcm lunar dust for plate dimensions of L = W = 10 cm and D = 5 cm) [15,16]. Although the application of ELDC is limited to the sufficiently charged falling lunar dust, ELDC has the advantages of negligible power consumption for efficient dust collection before the deposition [17]. Alternatively, an electrostatic lunar dust repeller (ELDR) was proposed to protect surfaces by applying needle-shape electrodes that are connected to the same terminal of the power supply to repel the incoming like-charged lunar dust. Although the ELDR came with three advantages of less sunlight blockage, less weight and no need of electrode cleaning compared to the ELDC, power consumption of the ELDR is significantly higher, making its application limited to the surface areas smaller than 900 cm2 [18]. While the EDS has been well studied experimentally, all previous studies on the ELDC offering two major advantages of low material cost and low electric power consumption have been theoretical with simplified assumptions of spherical particles, identical particles size and density, and uniformly distributed charges on the particles. Moreover, the perfect vacuum (10\u221214 Torr) assumed in the theoretical model ignores the effect of vacuum level on the ELDC performance and particle chargeability required for ELDC applications in other environments (e.g., Martian atmosphere). The approximated electrostatic field and charge distribution on the ELDC plates using numerical models also need verification. Therefore, the current study was embarked to address the above-mentioned modeling limitations, to investigate tribochargeability of most common lunar dust simulants (JSC-1A and Chenobi), and to evaluate the collection efficiency of an ELDC experimentally using a novel remotely controlled tribocharging device. The reasons for selecting tribocharging as the charging method of lunar dust simulants were its productivity and ease of use for application inside the vacuum chambers [19]. For instance, application of UV source inside vacuum chamber requires an insulating coating layer on the chamber inner walls as well as conducting surfaces of other equipment to prevent photoemission [20], which interferes with the charge measurement and electrostatic field generation of this study. Tribocharging of particles is a common technique for separating insulator particles in various industrial applications (e.g., treatment of ash from coal in power plants) [21]. In this charging mechanism (also known as triboelectricity or contact electrification), electrical charges are generated and exchanged due to the particles\u2019 contacts to the container wall as well as particles\u2019 slides on other particles. Such an exchange is due to the difference in energy levels (the energy required to release the outmost electron respect to the core of an atom) of the contacting materials until establishment of an equilibrium between the energy levels. Electrons flow from the material with a lower work function (\u03a6 1) to the material with a higher work function (\u03a6 2) until equilibrium is reached [22]. In contrast to conducting materials, there is no unified model for charge transfer between insulating materials. However, results of a study by Castle [23] showed that the total transferred charge is linearly proportional to the absolute difference between work functions of the contacting materials. To choose the appropriate material for tribocharging, work function of lunar dust simulants should be available. The work function of Chenobi lunar dust simulants is still unknown, and there are only a handful of studies regarding the work function of JSC-1A lunar dust simulations. Sternovsky et al. [22] conducted tribocharging experiments inside a vacuum chamber on fine particles to infer the work function of JSC-1A by comparing the total measured charge of the JSC-1A sample compared to other particles made from known materials. Their result suggested 5.9 eV as the work function of JSC-1A lunar dust simulants [24]. Trigwell et al. [25] took a similar approach for determining the JSC-1A work function by adding inclined planes made of select materials between the dust dropper and Faraday Cup for strengthening the electrification. Their work identified. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the JSC-1A work function to be 5.4 eV. In the first stage of this study, tribocharging properties of two selected lunar dust simulants (JSC-1A and Chenobi) were investigated. Then, the importance of plate conductivity in particle collection was investigated by comparing stainless steel and aluminum as the material for the ELDC plates. Finally, the collection efficiency of a customized ELDC as a function of applied voltage at low vacuum (10\u22121 Torr) and high vacuum (10\u22125 Torr) levels was determined.  As shown in Fig. 1 , the experimental set-up consisted of a chamber enclosing four key elements: particle tribocharger, particle dropper, particle collector (ELDC), and particle charge measurer (Faraday Cup and electrometer). First, the particle tribocharger rotating around its longitudinal axis charged particles for a pre-set period of time. Then, these charged particles were released from the tribocharger. The exact elevation of the tribocharger inside the chamber was set to attain the same particle velocity at the ELDC entrance determined in the previous modeling efforts [14\u201316,18]. Since the first set of experiments aimed to obtain charging properties of the lunar dust simulants as a function of time, falling particles directly entered the Faraday Cup (MONROE, diameter = 10 cm, depth = 15 cm) with the ELDC turned-off. The total charge of the ensemble particles inside the Faraday Cup was read using an electrometer (KEITHLEY, Model 6514 with 0.1 pC reading precision). To study the effect of air pressure on tribocharging, experiments were conducted at three pressure levels: atmospheric, low vacuum and high vacuum. The low vacuum experiments were conducted at the vacuum level of about 10\u22121 Torr using a 2-stage rotary vane vacuum pump (Oerlikon Leybold TriVac D16B) connected to a transparent cylindrical chamber made of 1-in-thick PVC (see Fig. 2 a). The high vacuum experimental set-up was designed using a turbo-molecular vacuum pump (Oerlikon Leybold TurboVac 361) added between the mentioned 2-stage rotary vacuum pump and a stainless steel vacuum chamber (HVB-100-N088171, RIBER Inc., Bezons, France) to achieve a vacuum level of about 10\u22125 Torr (see Fig. 2b). Evaluating the influence of tribocharging duration on the created charge on particles was the main goal of the first set of experiments. In the second set of experiments, ELDC was turned on, and its collection efficiencies at different applied voltages, different plate materials and different vacuum levels were determined. A variety of lunar dust simulants made for different purposes are commercially available. Two types of most commonly used lunar dust simulants, JSC-1A and Chenobi, were tested in this study. Developed by NASA\u2013Johnson Space Center, JSC-1A lunar dust simulant is produced from a basaltic ash and sheet deposit located in San Francisco Volcanic Field of Arizona. JSC-1A has been shown to have similar mechanical properties and characteristics to the lunar grains [26]. On the other hand, Chenobi is a chemically enhanced version of OB-1 dust simulant. It is produced from a mixture of anorthosite from northern Ontario of Canada and smelter glass made of anorthosite itself [27]. The average particle density of JSC-1A lunar simulant is 2.91 g/cm3 [28], while the density of Chenobi lunar dust simulant is 2.76 g/cm3 [29]. The most conservative particle size for the mentioned cycle of lunar dust levitation\u2013deposition was estimated to be dp \u223c 20 \u03bcm in previous studies [15,16,18]. For consistency, lunar dust simulants with the size ranging from 20 to 25 \u03bcm were used in the experiments. Particle velocity at the entrance of the ELDC was controlled by changing the distance between the tribocharger exit and the ELDC entrance. Based on the dynamic fountain model for lunar dust levitation developed by Stubbs et al. [3], the particle velocity (\u03bd 0 p) at the ELDC entrance can be estimated conservatively as in Eq. (1): \u03bd0p=2glZmax=2\u03d5sdp6\u03b50\u03c1p where \u03d5s is the surface potential of the lunar grains, \u03b5 0 is the permittivity of the space (8.854 \u00d7 10\u221212 F/m), \u03c1p is the particle density, Z max is the distance between the ELDC entrance and the height particles are released from, and gl is the lunar gravitational acceleration (1.62 m/s2). To attain the same initial particle velocity at the ELDC entrance (\u03bd 0 p) as in the previous studies (1.31 m/s for dp = 20 \u03bcm) [15,16,18], the distance between the tribocharger exit and the ELDC entrance was set according to the kinematic equation of motion (\u03bd 0 p 2/2 g \u2243 9 cm). The standard test sieves (Gilson Inc.) conforming with ASTM E-11 specifications were used to classify lunar dust simulants with the size of interest. The sieves were mounted on a vibratory sieve shaker (Retsch AS200 control) running at an amplitude of 1 mm for 1 h. Preliminary sieving tests showed that continuing the particle sieving longer than 1 h at the 1 mm amplitude does not affect the mass distribution of the accumulated particles on the sieves. For both types of lunar dust simulants, particles that passed through sieve No. 500 (corresponding to the mesh size of 25 \u03bcm) and got collected on sieve No. 635 (corresponding to the mesh size of 20 \u03bcm) were selected for the experiments of this study. Due to the specific condition of the lunar environment, lunar grains are fully dry. To keep the particles away from the high relative humidity of the laboratory (75% in average), particles were stored inside sealed glass containers with silica gel packets installed on the internal walls. Before starting each experiment, the weighed sample was kept inside an oven (Fisher Isotemp Oven, 100 Series, Model 106G) at 100 \u00b0C for an hour. A 5-gram simulant sample weighed by a high precision microbalance (Sartorius MC210S, readability = 10 \u03bcg) was used for each experiment. Each experiment was replicated 5 times. Considering \u03a6 JSC-1A = 5.4\u20135.9 eV, in this study, the selected material to be in contact with the lunar dust simulants was aluminum (\u03a6 Al = 4.28 eV) with two advantageous of having relatively greater |\u03a6 2\u2013\u03a6 1| compared to other common materials, as well as being adequately light to be held horizontally while it. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "is rotating to tribocharge. Different tribocharging devices such as fluidized beds, vibrating feeders, static tribochargers, tribo-cyclones, tribo-fans, and rotating tubes are commonly used. However, the choice of particle tribocharger in this study was limited to the ones that would not disturb the air pressure inside the chamber since the experimental set-up had to run at low pressures. Both the inclined plane tribocharger proposed by Captain et al. [30] and the rotary milling tube proposed by Sharma et al. [31] are known as effective tribocharging methods for the lunar dust simulants inside vacuum. In this study, a hybrid tribocharger synergistically integrating both the rotary tube and the inclined plane was designed to obtain the highest possible surface charges. As shown in Fig. 3 , the aluminum connector attached the aluminum tube to the armature, which was connected to a low voltage power supply. Due to the centrifugal force acting on fine particles with negligible weights, these particles may stick to the tube wall preventing them from the repeatedly effective contacts with the aluminum surfaces. This acting centrifugal force depends on particle size, tube diameter and rotational speed of the tube. Yang et al. [32] conducted sensitivity analysis on the rotational speed of a drum partially full with 3 mm particles through numerical simulations. That study identified six regimes for the particle dynamics inside the rotating drum: slumping, slumping-rolling transition, rolling, cascading, cataracting and centrifuging. Effective particle contacts occur only at slumping and rolling regimes. Tribocharging of the particles requires repeated contacts between the particles and the aluminum wall surface. Thus, the rotational speed of the armature was controlled to be \u223c100 rpm by limiting the applied voltage of the armature to 1 V in all experiments. Moreover, chains of 2 mm aluminum beads were glued to the aluminum connector to enhance particles friction with aluminum surfaces while they were sliding inside the tube (see Fig. 3). The dual-functionality of the tribocharger (tribocharging and dropping) was achieved using a small lever connected to the remotely controlled armature to switch the particle tribocharger/dropper orientation from horizontal (to tribocharge the particles) to vertical (to drop the tribocharged particles down toward the Faraday Cup through the aluminum funnel) (see Fig. 2c). Part of the fallen particles slid on the funnel for further tribocharging improvement of the system. Geometry and rotational speed of the tribocharger determine the appropriate amount of sampled micron-sized particles to ensure effective tribocharging. Zelmet et al. [21] performed a comparative experimental study on different types of tribocharging devices to charge 1 mm PVC particles in atmospheric pressure. Their study revealed that charging efficiency of the static tribocharger utilizing inclined surfaces to direct particles falling under gravity and rotating tubes is insensitive to the mass of particles inside the tribocharger. However, not all of the tribocharged particles reach the ELDC entrance after the release, because a fraction of particles either sticks to the tribocharger wall, stays on the funnel, or puffs out from the tribocharger while rotating. In order to get adequate amount of released particles inside the Faraday Cup and possessing enough charge to be detected by the electrometer, the mass of all sampled particles initially put inside the tribocharger was set to be 5 g \u00b1 10 \u03bcg. A standard Faraday Cup, connected to the nano-Coulomb electrometer was implemented for the charge measurements. The ELDC was made of two square-shape conducting parallel plates mounted on a wooden frame. Using alligator clips, the ELDC plates were connected to a low voltage DC power supply with capability of voltage provision up to 150 V. Due to the insulating property of the vacuum medium existing between the plates, ELDC acted practically as a parallel-plate capacitor with electrostatic field streamlines originating from the positively charged plate toward the negatively charged plate. Dimensions of the plates and separation distance were 10 cm \u00d7 10 cm and 5 cm, respectively, following the values used in previous studies [15,16]. Since aluminum-made tribocharger produced negatively charged particles, the positively charged plate of the ELDC was the collection plate for the entire experiments. Two plate materials of stainless steel and aluminum were tested in this study. Both mass- and charge-based ratios (\u03b7 1 and \u03b7 2) were considered for determining the ELDC collection efficiencies as defined in Eqs. (2) and (3): \u03b7m(%)=mcmc+m1\u00d7100 \u03b7q(%)=1-q1/m1q2/m2\u00d7100=1-q1m2q2m1\u00d7100 where mc is the mass of particles collected on the collection plate, m 1 and q 1 are the total mass and total charge of the particles inside the Faraday Cup respectively when ELDC is turned on at a certain applied voltage, and m 2 and q2 are the total mass and total charge of the particles inside the Faraday Cup when ELDC is turned off. Eq. (2) is solely mass-based, requiring one run per data-point, but Eq. (3) requires two experimental runs per data-point: one in the presence and one in the absence of the ELDC. Although ideally the particles are monodisperse with identical properties, the created surface charges on particles are different from one another due to the randomness of their tribocharging contacts. Consequently, the probability of collection depends not only on its initial displacement with respect to the collection plate, but also is a function of the acquired surface charge on the target particle. This explains the importance of presenting ELDC collection efficiency following the charged-based Eq. (3).  Using the low vacuum experimental set-up, the first set of experiments obtained insight into tribochargeability of the lunar dust simulants. Tribocharging duration was increased in 5 min increments to investigate how total charge of the sample changes with time. Fig. 4 displays the results on the time of tribocharing (tt) at atmospheric and low vacuum pressures. In the presence of air molecules (atmospheric pressure), the maximum total charge occurred at tt = 5 min as the interactions with air molecules hindered achievement of any greater values of the total charge. The tribo-chargeability improved significantly (2\u20133 times) at the low vacuum condition due to the reduced interactions with the air molecules while charging. Hence, charge build-up. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "on the particles continued at the provided 10\u22121 Torr vacuum level. The tribochargeability of the Chenobi particles was lower than the JSC-1A particles. Apparently, Chenobi particles had higher cohesivity and agglomerated even inside the storing container which may be the main reason for obtaining lower surface charge on the Chenobi particles. Although cohesivity of the JSC-1A particles have been studied using a DEM model [33] and through shear stress test following ASTM-6773 standard [34], unfortunately, no studies have been conducted on Chenobi particles to compare the interparticle cohesion forces. One should notice that the tribocharging in Fig. 4a and b increased with time, and continuing the experiments for longer than 20 min would result in a higher amount of surface charge on the sample. However, the rate of tribocharging is expected to decrease with time and extrapolating the plotted graph to obtain the charging time corresponding to the saturation charge on particles is not practical. Moreover, since the required tribocharging time to achieve saturation charge may be excessively long, the tribocharging time of 20 min was maintained for the remaining set of experiments. Due to higher tribochargeability of the JSC-1A particles, experiments on ELDC collection efficiency at both low and high vacuum conditions were only conducted on 5 replicates of the JSC-1A particles running each for 20 min. Under the high vacuum condition, which is four orders of magnitude greater, almost 250 times greater charge per mass (|Q/m|) on the JSC-1A samples (629 \u00b1 58 nC/g) was achieved. The effective tribocharging method proposed in this study offered about 21 times higher |Q/m| compared to a previous study by Captain et al. [30] where tribocharging property of the JSC-1A was evaluated against aluminum inclined planes. Although their experiments were run under a higher vacuum level of 8 \u00d7 10\u22126 Torr, the more efficient tribocharging method introduced in the present study and the fact that 2\u20133 times larger JSC-1A particles (50\u201375 \u03bcm) tested in their study presents 2\u20133 times smaller surface-to-volume ratio, contributed to the higher surface charge on the particles in the present study. Since the average size range of the sieved particles was 20 \u03bcm < dp < 25 \u03bcm, the average charge per particle (qp) can be approximated. Assuming spherical particles with an average diameter of dp = 22.5 \u03bcm, qp for JSC-1A particles at low and high vacuum conditions were 4.34 \u00d7 10\u221217 C (about 271 electrons) and 1.10 \u00d7 10\u221214 C (about 68,700 electrons), respectively. According to the model by Goertz [14,35], the theoretical charge under ultra-high vacuum can be estimated by: qp=2\u03c0\u03b50dp\u03d5s At the electric surface potential (\u03d5s) of 100 V for the same size of particles which was considered as the average electric surface potential in the previous models, the surface charge on a particle is about 1.11 \u00d7 10\u221213 C, which is significantly larger than that obtained experimentally at the low vacuum but only 10 times greater than that obtained experimentally at the high vacuum. The surface potential of the lunar grains is a function of environmental factors such as temperature, density of the incoming solar particles and intensity of the solar radiations. Therefore, the different methods of charging (tribocharging versus photoemissive solar radiation) and environment (\u223c10\u22125 Torr inside vacuum chamber compared to \u223c10\u221213 Torr on the moon) are at least partially responsible in observing 10 times smaller corresponding value for the surface potential appeared in Eq. (4) for the tested lunar dust simulants. Except having the ELDC turned on, the same experimental procedure as for the first set of experiments was followed for this set of experiments. The tribocharging time of tt = 20 min corresponding to the highest obtained surface charge on particles in the first set of experiments was chosen for the entire set of experiments. The effect of electrical conductivity (\u03c3) of the ELDC plates on ELDC collection efficiency was examined by replacing stainless steel (\u03c3 = 1.45 \u00d7 106 S/m) with aluminum (\u03c3 = 3.5 \u00d7 107 S/m) at low vacuum condition. This is equivalent to 24 times increase in electron mobility of the collection plate. As shown in Fig. 5 , collection efficiency of the ELDC at low vacuum level was improved using aluminum electrode for the same set of conditions. Collection efficiency improvement due to replacement of aluminum increased at the higher applied voltages. In both cases, the charge-based collection efficiencies were higher than the mass-based collection efficiencies for the same applied voltage. If surface charge on each particle and initial displacement of falling particles at ELDC entrance were uniform, the values for the collection efficiencies obtained from Eqs. (2) and (3) should be the same for the tested lunar dust simulants. Obtaining higher charge-based collection efficiency means the fraction of particles collected over the collection plate had acquired a higher surface charge compared to the particles that penetrated through the ELDC and settled inside the Faraday Cup. This leads to the conclusion of having a deviation for the distributed charges over the tribocharged sample. Due to higher effectiveness of aluminum ELDC plate (40\u201395% greater collection efficiency value at the same applied voltage), all remaining experiments of this study were conducted with aluminum plates. Fig. 6 displays collection efficiency at law and high vacuum conditions. Collection efficiency of the ELDC improved with an increase in electric potential difference between the plates. This relationship is consistent with the derived 2-D equation (Eq. (5)) and the numerically obtained graphs reported in previous studies [14\u201316]. \u03b7=6\u0394V\u03b50\u03d5s\u03c1pgl2D2dp224\u03b50\u03d5s2\u03c1pdp2+2glL-2\u03d5sdp6\u03b50\u03c1p2 where \u0394V is the applied voltage (electric potential difference between the ELDC plates), L is the length of ELDC plates and D is the spacing between the plates. Although the range of the selected potential difference was the same as in the previously developed numerical models [15,16], at low vacuum condition, experimentally obtained collection efficiencies were lower, 0.25\u20131% for the mass-based and 0.45\u20131.45% for the charge-based definition, than what were expected from the analytical and numerical models. Owing to the higher created electric surface potential on the particles at high vacuum, the collection efficiencies. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "boosted up to 8\u201335% for mass-based and 12\u201354% for the charge-based definition. The provided vacuum levels inside the chambers were about 10\u22121 and 10\u22125 Torr, which are far from the reported range of 10\u221213\u201310\u221214 Torr lunar environment. Interactions between the air molecules and charged particles shorten the time particles maintain the created surface charge [36]. Considering the obtained results of this study at two different vacuum levels and previous studies by Trigwell et al. [25] Captain et al. [30] and Sharma et al. [31], the vacuum level can be concluded to be the most important factor to achieve high surface charge on the particles, and consequently high collection efficiencies as predicted from the models. Ultimately, insufficient charges on the particles were the main reason for obtaining 1.1\u20133.1 times lower ELDC collection efficiencies compared to the previously developed theoretical methods for the same applied voltage. The second reason for observing lower measured ELDC collection efficiency values through the experimental approach is the difference between the lunar gravitational acceleration (gl = 1.62 m/s2) in the models and the terrestrial gravitational acceleration that governed the experiments (g = 9.81 m/s2). Thus, the falling lunar dust accelerated faster than simulated while penetrating through the ELDC. Considering the kinematic equations of motion for the falling particles, the experimental ELDC has about 15% shorter residence time (0.062 s) for lunar dust simulants collection compared to the case occurring on the moon (0.073 s). The ELDC collection efficiency at terrestrial gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m/s2) can be estimated using Eq. (5) for the four tested applied voltages of the experiments. This obtains 1.39 times lower collection efficiency values compared to the case using lunar gravitational acceleration: 21.7%, 42.8%, 63.9% and 85.6% for the applied voltages of 33, 65, 97 and 130 V, respectively. The estimated values using Eq. (5) are still higher than the experimentally calculated ELDC collection efficiencies of this study (7.35 \u00b1 1.11%, 18.0 \u00b1 1.7%, 28.4 \u00b1 1.9% and 35.4 \u00b1 1.6% for the mass-based approach, and 12.0 \u00b1 1.5%, 32.0 \u00b1 1.1%, 42.4 \u00b1 1.5% and 54.2 \u00b1 1.5% for the charge-based approach). Ideal ultra-vacuum level and other simplifying assumptions of the analytical model are responsible for the observed lower experimental results. Fig. 7 illustrates the pattern of the collected particles for applied voltage of 65 V at low vacuum condition. The result demonstrates that the areal density of the collected particles was higher near the corners of the collection plate. This observation is consistent with the non-uniform electrostatic field predicted in the previous study [15] which is also known as fringe effect [37]. It should be noted that most particles were collected particularly on the upper one third of the plate. The reason is that falling particles which entered the ELDC closer to the collection plate were attracted with a relatively stronger electrostatic field toward the upper one third of the plate. In comparison, particles which entered the ELDC relatively further from the collection plate needed to move a longer path to reach the plate, where the exertion of a relatively weaker e-field at the center and a relatively stronger e-field from the lower one third was insufficient to collect these particles before they exited the ELDC [15]. Moreover, an increase in particle velocity while particles were passing through the ELDC, which is significant at the terrestrial gravitational acceleration with approximately 60% higher velocity at the ELDC exit compared to the ELDC entrance, was another reason for observing a lower number of collected particles at the lower third of the collection plate.  Tribocharging properties of two noted lunar dust simulants (JSC-1A and Chenobi) and proficiency of a previously proposed electrostatic lunar dust collector (ELDC) were studied experimentally. Tribochargeability of both simulants strongly depended on the air pressure as the total amount of created charge on the sample at low vacuum condition of 10\u22121 Torr was 2\u20133 times higher than the case at the ambient pressure. The accumulated surface charge at the standard pressure increased with time initially but decreased later on due to the contacts of identical particles with the same work function and the interactions with existing air molecules. At low vacuum, the total charge increased with time within the 20-min time frame of the experiment. Application of aluminum plates, which have 24 times higher conductivity than stainless steel plates, improved ELDC collection efficiency especially at the higher applied voltages. Tribochargeability of the JSC-1A particles was better than the Chenobi particles. The maximum surface charge on the JSC-1A particles after 20 min of tribocharging was about 2.5 nC/g. At high vacuum, lowering the air pressure to the higher vacuum level of 10\u22125 Torr increased the total charge/mass of the JSC-1A sample about 250 times (total charge per mass value of 629 \u00b1 58 nC/g). The charge-based and mass-based ELDC collection efficiencies confirmed the predicted linear relationship between the efficiency and the applied voltage. The observed pattern of particle collection over the collection plate was consistent with the theoretical prediction in that the majority of the collected particles were located close to the plate corners (especially in the upper third). The resultant range of collection efficiencies (0.25\u20131.0% for the mass-based and 0.45\u20131.4% for the charge-based definition at the low vacuum; 8\u201335% for the mass-based and 12\u201354% for the charge-based definition at the high vacuum) were averagely 1.1\u20133.1 times lower than the values based on theoretical models. The differences were stemmed from the ultra-high vacuum level on the moon and existence of the six times smaller gravitational acceleration of the lunar environment.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apenergy.2013.07.010.txt", "paper": ["Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the renewable energy technologies that has great potential in supplying the world\u2019s energy needs. According to a statistic from BP Global [1], the total installed capacity of solar PV around the globe in 2012 reached 100.1 GW, as presented in Fig. 1 . Around 68.4% of the installations were carried out in Europe, 8.2% in North America with the remaining balance found in other parts of the world. The rising trend of solar PV installation in many countries is mainly catalysed by the implementation of a financial incentive known as the feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme, which is currently enacted in more than 80 countries [2]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) identified potential in integrating solar PV into the architectural design of roofs and facades for all types of building. A study [3] was conducted by the IEA to assess the prospect of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems in 14 selected countries. The study concluded that there is a BIPV area potential totalling approximately 23 billion m2 and could generate about 3 PW h annually. According to another study by Oliver and Jackson [4], BIPV systems could offer additional advantages when compared with centralised solar PV plant which include the following: Eliminate the cost of land acquisitions and the cost of support structures since the PV panels are mounted/replacing the building structure. The cabling cost could also be reduced since all buildings have access to the grid, unlike an isolated PV site. The electricity generated by BIPV systems could be consumed in the building itself, which minimises the losses due to the transmission and distribution of electricity. A reduction in the electricity bill could be achieved since the electricity generation coincides with the peak electricity demand during the day. The integration of PV panel substitutes parts of the building (e.g. roof, window, facade), eliminating the need for other building materials, which can be costly. In the last decade, there has been a significant rise in the use of solar concentrators for BIPV applications, including sky lights, double glazing windows and solar blinds [5\u20137]. A solar concentrator is a device that allows the collection of sunlight from a large area and focuses it on a smaller receiver or exit [8]. The concentrator is aimed at reducing the usage of expensive PV material, hence reducing the overall cost of the system [5]. One example is the luminescence solar concentrator (LSC). With the ability to make full use of direct and diffuse sunlight, LSCs have the potential to replace windows and building facades. However, their low efficiency (the highest conversion efficiency is only 7.1% [9]) makes them less attractive for electricity generation, particularly if a homeowner wants to take full advantage of the FiT scheme. Another concentrator type, called the asymmetrical compound parabolic photovoltaic concentrator (ACPPVC), was demonstrated by Mallick et al. [10]. These concentrators are made from reflective materials with strips of solar cell connected in series and attached at the exit aperture of the concentrators. Their experimental results indicate that this concentrator managed to increase the maximum electrical output power by 62% when compared with a similar system without a concentrator [10]. The panel could also be mounted on the roof or replace the wall of a building. The asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) extrusion is another example employed by the Photovoltaic Facades of Reduced Cost Incorporating Devices with Optically Concentrating Elements (PRIDE) project which was carried out in the late 1990s [7,11]. The asymmetrical CPC is made from dielectric material. The first generation of PRIDE technology concentrators produced 2.3 times more electrical output when compared with a flat plate conventional solar PV [11]. However, it has disadvantages in terms of durability and instability of the dielectric material under long term outdoor characterisation [12]. This is because the concentrators were produced from casting processes which are prone to UV degradation [12]. With the aim of large scale production, durability and reduction in weight and cost, the second generation PRIDE design was developed in 2006 [12]. The prototype of the improved design was a 3 kWp PV concentrator module and was built using injection moulding processes. This design is suitable for building facade integration. When compared with a non-concentrating system, this prototype achieves a 2.01 output power gain. It is projected that the second generation PRIDE technology system could reduce the module cost by approximately 40% [12]. Recently, Sellami et al. developed a novel static 3D concentrator called the Square Elliptical Hyperboloid (SEH) for BIPV applications [5]. This concentrator has an elliptical entry aperture, hyperbolic side profiles and a square or rectangular exit aperture where a PV cell is attached. It has the potential to be integrated into double glazed windows. With a concentration value of 4\u00d7 and acceptance angle of 120\u00b0 (\u00b160\u00b0), an optical efficiency of 40% was recorded [5]. The large value of acceptance angle helps to eliminate the need for mechanical solar tracking. Clive has also proposed an alternative design for BIPV systems known as SolarBrane which comprises of extrusions of dielectric totally internally reflecting concentrators (DTIRCs) [13]. SolarBrane can reduce the usage of PV material by 70% while maintaining the same output power when compared with a traditional solar panel [14]. The use of DTIRCs has the potential of reducing the cost of implementation of conventional solar PV systems by 40% [14]. Chemisana et al. [15] on the other hand investigated a holographic solar concentrator for the BIPV applications. This concentrator is capable of diffracting light in the spectral bandwidth to which the cell presents the highest sensitivity \u2013 allowing the PV cell to be protected from overheating [15]. It is reported that the holographic concentrator managed to increase the efficiency of the PV cell by 3% [15]. This paper proposes a new type of solar concentrator for use in BIPV systems. This concentrator is known as a mirror symmetrical dielectric totally internally reflecting concentrator (MSDTIRC). Section 2 explains the steps involved in producing the design, and the geometrical properties of the MSDTIRC. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "are presented in Section 3. The optical concentration gain analysis is carried out in Section 4 prior to presenting the experimental result of the optical gain of the concentrator in Section 5. The annual output prediction of implementing the MSDTIRC in Malaysia is discussed in Section 6. Next the potential of MSDTIRC is outlined in Section 7. Conclusions are presented at the end of the paper.  The MSDTIRC is a new variation of the DTIRC. This concentrator is able to achieve different field of views on different planes. In contrast to the rotational axis symmetrical DTIRC proposed by Ning et al. [16], this novel design generates a mirror symmetry design in four axes parallel to the base of the concentrator. The MSDTIRC uses the DTIRC based on the phase conserving method (PCM) as the design\u2019s foundation. The MSDTIRC requires a number of input parameters, which are listed below; the total height of the concentrator, (HTot), the trial front surface arc angle (\u03c6), the acceptance angle on the x-axis (\u03b8a \u2212 x), the acceptance angle on the z-axis (\u03b8a \u2212 z), the length of the PV cell (LPV), the width of the PV cell (WPV), the trial length of the entrance aperture (d 1), the index of refraction of the material (n) and the number of extreme rays(N). A MATLAB\u00ae based program has been developed to create the MSDTIRC. The algorithm is summarised in Fig. 2 . First, a 2D design is calculated based on the input variables, with the initial acceptance value equal to the acceptance angle on the x-axis (\u03b8a \u2212 x). The computer program calculates the trial height, which is later used to calculate the coordinates of the side wall. This calculation takes into account the number of extreme rays entering the concentrator at the critical angle. Once it is completed, the program compares the trial entrance aperture with the calculated aperture. A new entrance aperture is then computed from the difference between the two apertures. A number of iterations take place until the difference between both apertures is within an acceptableerror value. The calculated total height of the concentrator is then compared with the desired total height. The total height is adjusted by varying the front surface arc angle until the difference between the total heights is within an acceptable value. The process is repeated to get the next 2D design, with each new design computed by incrementing the acceptance angle and the exit diameter accordingly using the value of \u0394\u03b8a and \u0394d 0 respectively. The process stops when a 180\u00b0 rotation around the y-axis is completed. Fig. 3 illustrates of the steps to produce the MSDTIRC, starting from position (plane) 1. For each position, a different profile is generated having different front surface arc angle and positioned at a different location of the exit aperture. The MSDTIRC shown in Fig. 4 is generated by selecting the total height HTot of 3.0 cm, an acceptance angle \u03b8a \u2212 x in the x-axis of \u00b130\u00b0, an acceptance angle \u03b8a \u2212 z in the z-axis of \u00b140\u00b0 and a refractive index n of the dielectric material from which the optical element is constructed with a value of 1.5. Unlike the 3-D rotationally symmetry DTIRC that has a smooth dome-shaped front surface entrance aperture, this design has a sectored front surface with four axis of mirror symmetry (see Fig. 4d). Depending on the selection of inputparameters, the front surface will be different from each design. Another important characteristic of this concentrator is its square exit aperture, as presented in Fig. 4e. According to Sellami and Mallick [17], from the manufacturing point of view, it is desirable and easier to fabricate a square/rectangular cell, unlike a circular cell employed in a rotationally symmetry design.  This subsection analyses the impact that changing the total height and the index of refraction of the material has on the geometrical concentration gain of the MSDTIRC. This is useful to predict the final output gain based on the input parameters especially from the manufacturing point of view. Often, a high output gain is desirable, but this normally translates into a larger structure [13] and increases the material cost [14]. Therefore some trade off must be met, i.e. by choosing the appropriate gain while at the same time keeping the total cost as low as possible. The geometrical concentration gain of a 3D concentrator is defined as the ratio of the entrance aperture to the exit aperture of the concentrator [18]. It is not possible to know the direct relationship between the geometrical concentration gain, the front surface arc angle, and the acceptance angle in an MSDTIRC design. This is because it uses a range of acceptance angles in a single design and the front surface arc angle varies throughout its top surface. However, owing to the fact that the MSDTIRC\u2019s design strategy is based on the DTIRC design, it should mimic its characteristics. It has been shown that a DTIRC\u2019s geometrical concentration gain is inversely proportional to both the front surface arc angle and the acceptance angle [13,14]. By having a higher acceptance angle, the total height of the concentrator greatly reduces. To further simplify the analysis in this subsection, the MSDTIRC analysis is undertaken in three groups: Group 1, where the total height 1 is between 6.4 cm and 6.8 cm and the acceptance angle 2 is between \u00b115\u00b0 and \u00b125\u00b0. Group 2, where the total height is between 4.5 cm and 4.9 cm and the acceptance angle is between \u00b1 20\u00b0 to \u00b1 30\u00b0. Group 3, where the total height is between 2.9 cm and 3.2 cm and the acceptance angle is between \u00b130\u00b0 and \u00b140\u00b0. The relationship between the geometrical concentration gain and the total height (for each group of MSDTIRCs) using various refractive indices 3 is shown in Figs. 5\u20137 . Fig. 5 shows the gain for the MSDTIRCs from Group 1, which have the highest gain range of between 11 and 15. The gain in Group 2 ranges from. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "7 to 10 as presented in Fig. 6. The gain reduces to between 3.5 and 5.5 for Group 3, as indicated in Fig. 7. Comparing these three groups, it can be seen that as the total height and the acceptance angle are changed, the geometrical concentration gain varies greatly. The gain is also inversely proportional to the acceptance angle, which is as expected [13]. However, looking closely at the MSDTIRCs within the same group, the difference in height has a very small effect on the gain. It is also possible to conclude from the three graphs that MSDTIRCs fabricated using higher refractive index materials produce higher gains than similar MSDTIRCs made from materials having a lower refractive index. It is also interesting to note that there is no data available for an MSDTIRC with a total height of 2.8 cm with index of refraction of 1.47, 1.50 and 1.52 (see Fig. 7). This is because the MSDTIRC with these particular parameters is physically impossible to fabricate as they do not fulfil the necessary DTIRC conditions [16]. Therefore, depending on the desired design, some trade-offs may need to be made. For example, it may be possible to achieve a smaller solar concentrator with a wider field of view but accepting a smaller gain, or to use a concentrator with a smaller field of view and achieving a higher gain, but at the cost of a larger structure.  The optical concentration gain is defined as the ratio of the irradiance at the photo detector with a concentrator placed in front of it to that of a photo detector without the concentrator [22]. Based on the geometrical gain analysis presented in Section 3, it is possible to conclude that the optical concentration gain will present a similar trend. The purpose of the analysis in this section is to evaluate the variation of optical concentration gain of the MSDTIRC at different angles of incidence. The optical concentration gain variation is useful to predict the output performance of the MSDTIRC when the sun is considered as the light source. The angle variation of the incident rays along the x-axis represents the seasonal changes of the sun angle while the angle variation of the incident rays along the z-axis represents the daily sun path. To simplify the analysis, only one design of MSDTIRC is chosen from each group. The index of refraction of the material chosen for this analysis is 1.5. Three pieces of software are used to conduct this simulation. Because of the complexity of the design, MATLAB is used to generate the surface coordinates (point cloud) of any MSDTIRC, which are then imported into GeoMagic\u00ae or AutoCAD software, to generate a computer-aided design (CAD) model from which a Standard ACIS Text (SAT) format file model is obtained, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The SAT file is then used in an optical system design software called ZEMAX\u00ae to conduct the ray tracing analysis. The ray tracing analysis is presented in Fig. 8 . A square power source is chosen to produce one million parallel rays and is configured to produce an incoming power of 1000 W. The size of the source is large enough to cover the entirety entrance aperture of the concentrator at all angles of incidence. The CAD model of the MSDTIRC is placed at a distance of 35 cm from the source and a photo detector is attached at the exit aperture of the concentrator. First, the rays are fired perpendicular to the photodetector without the incorporation of the concentrator and the total power and the numbers of rays detected at the photo detector are recorded. The step is repeated by increasing the angle of incidence by 5\u00b0 until a value of 50\u00b0 is reached. Next, an MSDTIRC is \u201cattached\u201d to the photo detector (placed in between the source and the photo detector) and both steps are repeated. The analysis is carried out to investigate the optical concentration gain along both the x and the z-axes. Similar to the analysis in Refs. [5,22], it has been found in this analysis that the optical concentration gain reaches a maximum value when the rays are fired at normal incidence, and this value reduces gradually when the angle of incidence increases until it is equal to the value of the acceptance angle. Beyond the acceptance angle of the concentrator, the gain should decrease greatly. Figs. 9\u201311 show the optical performance of the MSDTIRCs for Groups 1, 2 and 3 design respectively. In Fig. 9, the maximum optical concentration gain of the MSDTIRC with a total height of 6.5 cm is 13.54. By increasing the angle of incidence of the rays along the x and z-axis, the optical concentration gain drops dramatically. The gain reduces to about 24% (of the maximum) when the angle of incidence reaches the acceptance angle of \u00b115\u00b0 along the x-axis and to about 10% when the angle of incidence reaches the acceptance angle of \u00b125\u00b0 along the z-axis. The gain drops to almost 0 when the angle of incidence is \u00b130\u00b0 or more. Fig. 10 shows the optical concentration gain of the sample from Group 2. When the rays are fired at normal incidence, the maximum optical concentration gain of the MSDTIRC with a total height of 4.5 cm is 8.62. An increase in the angle of incidence of the rays along the x and z-axis reduces the optical concentration gain, which drops considerably. The gain reduces to roughly 14% when the angle of incidence reaches the acceptance angle of \u00b120\u00b0 along the x-axis and to about 6% when the angle of incidence reaches the acceptance angle of \u00b130\u00b0 along the z-axis. The gain drops to almost 0 when the angle of incidence is \u00b140\u00b0 or more. A similar trend is also observed for the MSDTIRCs from Group 3. In Fig. 11, the peak value of optical concentration gain of the MSDTIRC with a total height of 3.0 cm is 4.43. An increase in the angle of incidence of the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "rays along the x and z-axes reduces the optical concentration gain gradually. The gain reduces to 8% when the angle of incidence reaches the acceptance angle of \u00b130\u00b0 along the x-axis and to about 3% when the angle of incidence reaches the acceptance angle of \u00b140\u00b0 along the z-axis. No significant gain is recorded when the angle of incidence is \u00b150\u00b0 or more. From the analysis, it can be concluded that within the desired acceptance angle, the MSDTIRC could provide significant optical concentration gainin a solar panel design, with the highest value recorded when the rays are at normal incidence. Outside the acceptance angle, the optical concentration gain is reduced significantly. Another factor that needs consideration when choosing the MSDTIRC is the distribution of irradiance concentration on the solar cell. Any non-uniformity of distribution of the irradiance on the cells reduces their efficiency [5]. The concentration of the irradiance on the solar cell due to the introduction of MSDTIRC is observed while investigating the optical concentration gain analysis. Fig. 12 shows the distribution of irradiance as a result of using the three concentrators at normal incidence. The simulation shows an even irradiance distribution on a normal flat solar cell, with a peak irradiance of 20 W/cm2, as indicated in Fig. 12 d. However, the concentration of light for Group 1 and 2 designs are concentrated mostly at four small areas of the cell, with the maximum concentration reaching 181\u00d7 and 130\u00d7 when compared with the flat solar cell. As for the Group 3 design, it produces a more uniform concentration distribution when compared with the designs from Group 1 and 2, with a maximum of 14\u00d7 with respect to the flat solar cell. A high concentration of power increases the solar cell temperature and significantly reduces the cell performance [5]. Any designs that required higher gain must incorporate a system to reduce the cell\u2019s temperature (either using air or water), and one ofthe solutions is to implement the hybrid/thermal system that utilises the co-generated heat to produce hot water [23].  An MSDTIRC from Group 3 was fabricated for experimental purposes. This has a total height of 3.0 cm and an acceptance angle of \u00b130\u00b0 along the x-plane and \u00b140\u00b0 along the z-plane. The geometrical concentration gain of the concentrator is 4.9069. The design was produced using material 6091 (manufactured by Renishaw PLC), which was selected because of its rigidity, water clarity and transparency. The material can also withstand high temperatures (up to 75 \u00b0C), is UV stable, has a refractive index of 1.515 and a transmissibility of 93.7%. The MSDTIRC prototype has been placed beneath a sun simulator. The sun simulator is set to exhibit an irradiance of 1000 W/m2, when the room temperature is 25 \u00b0C. Instead of changing the rays\u2019 angle, the MSDTIRC is mounted on a variable slop base, where the base can be tilted accordingly. The tilt angle is measured accurately using a digital tilt meter. The measurement of the short circuit current is taken, for an angle of inclination starting from 0\u00b0 to 50\u00b0, with intervals of 5\u00b0. The opto-electronic gain of the concentrator is obtained by dividing the MSDTIRC\u2019s short circuit current with the flat solar cell\u2019s short circuit current [16], and is plotted in Fig. 13. From Fig. 13, it is observed that within the acceptance angles of the MSDTIRC, the opto-electronic gain is always more than 1.2 when compared with the flat solar cell, where the peak value calculated from the experiment is 4.17. The corresponding peak value from the simulation is the peak value from the optical concentration gain, i.e. 4.59, indicating a deviation of about 9%. The result from the experiment shows good agreement with the simulation data. Some of the possible reasons for the deviation between the experimental and simulation values include manufacturing errors, such as uneven surfaces of the entrance aperture and over polishing on the profile of the side wall, misalignment between the exit aperture of the concentrator and the solar cell, and reflection on the front surface of the MSDTIRC.  It is possible to predict the annual output (in kW h) from the MSDTIRC 5 panel (see Fig. 14 ) and a conventional PV skylight (without concentrator) under Malaysia\u2019s environment. This comparison is carried out to evaluate the panels\u2019 performance based on the square meter of the PV material used in each panel. This analysis is carried out according to these assumptions, which are: (i) each panel has the length and width of 118.62 cm and 79.42 cm respectively, with cell conversion efficiency of 17.32% 6 ; (ii) the samples are installed in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia (103\u00b025\u2032); (iii) the samples are mounted on a south facing rooftop at an angle of 103\u00b0 from the vertical to match the longitude of the site, and (iv) no mechanical tracking system is employed by the system. The simulation is carried out using ZEMAX\u00ae to evaluate the opto-electronic gain of the samples. Based on the average daily solar irradiance data in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia [25], the variation of sun path throughout the year [21] and the daily opto-electronic gain from the ZEMAX\u00ae simulation, the energy yield from both samples are calculated. Fig. 15 shows the annual output from the MSDTIRC panel and the traditional PV skylight. It can be seen that the MSDTIRC could increase the electrical output by 2.16 times when compared with amount generated by the traditional PV skylight, generating about 107.59 kW h per year. However, the predicted annual energy only indicates the comparison in terms of electricity generation. Other benefits of utilising an MSDTIRC panel should also be taken into account; especially in terms of illumination and the possibility of generating hot water and space heating, which will further reduce the energy requirement in a building.  The MSDTIRC-PV system offers several advantages when compared with the conventional flat plate panel. These are: It utilises only a fraction of the silicon solar cell in the design \u2013 as little as only 10% (depending on. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the design) when compared to the normal solar panel. It is understood the silicon wafers covers immense fraction of the total cost of the module, typically between 40% and 60% depending on the type of solar cell [17,26]. The large entrance aperture allows the rays within the acceptance angle of the concentrator to be concentrated on the solar cell hence increasing the electrical output. The gain increment offset a reduction in terms of the size of the cell. The usage of a square solar cell is desirable and easier to fabricate unlike the circular cell in the rotationally symmetry design [26]. It is constructed from transparent dielectric material by using a moulding technique, which is cheaper than the cost of displaced silicon solar cell and much easier to mass produce hence minimising the manufacturing cost. For rays impinging on the entrance aperture outside the acceptance angle range and in between the entrance aperture of the concentrators, these rays could pass through the transparent material providing natural illumination for a building, which could potentially reduce the energy consumption and electricity cost for lighting purposes. The large acceptance angle also helps to eliminate the need for mechanical tracking. Tracking systems often consume electrical energy and are normally associated with PV power plant [8]. Small compact dielectric concentrators coupled with small solar cells produce more economical and practical designs than larger and heavier dielectric concentrators [27]. The concentrating PV (CPV) system works better and more efficiently when it is operated in a hybrid/thermal system application, which generates both electricity and hot water at the same time [23]. When coupled with the FiT scheme, the total cost reduction of the system enables the participant(s) to gain more total profit, a higher return on investment, and a shorter payback period [28,29].  This paper explores the MSDTIRC, a new type of DTIRC. The method to produce an MSDTIRC has been explored and the geometrical analysis of the MSDTIRC is presented in detail. Through simulation results, it has been demonstrated that this MSDTIRC provides significant optical concentration gain within its acceptance angle. In this paper, the optical concentration gaincould reach up to 13.54\u00d7. when compared with the non-concentrating solar cell. This is verified in through experimental work and a deviation of only 9% from the peak value is recorded. It can be concluded that the MSDTIRC can beaway to produce a low cost solar PV system and can be chosen as an alternative design for the BIPV systems.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Development of nontoxic, highly efficient and low-cost materials is a worldwide fundamental objective to satisfy the overall demands for energy production. Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is a relatively earth-abundant and environmentally benign material for use in many areas including solar cells [1\u20133], supercapacitors [4], thermoelectric devices [5], photodetectors [6] and photocatalysts [7,8]. Due to its direct band gap of 1.7\u20132.2\u202feV, which closely matches the maximum of the solar spectrum, high absorption coefficient (\u03b1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f105\u202fcm\u22121 at \u03bb\u202f=\u202f450\u202fnm) [9], efficient charge extraction and low toxicity, crystalline Sb2S3 has drawn much attention in photoelectric fields [10,11], including photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. For instance, Sb2S3 was used to photosensitize ZnO photocatalysts to enhance the production of hydrogen from water by photosplitting; a significant amount of H2 gas was collected with a maximum production of 77.5\u202f\u03bcmol [7]. Kozytskiy et al. reported that crystalline FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3 exhibited PEC activity in aqueous solutions of ascorbic acid as a sacrificial electron donor. The maximal photocurrent density generated by the TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrode was higher than that of the bare FTO/TiO2 film by a factor of 3.6 [12]. Various methods have been employed to prepare Sb2S3 thin films, such as aqueous chemical bath deposition (CBD) [13\u201316], vacuum evaporation [17,18], spray pyrolysis [19,20], electrodeposition [21], and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) [22]. Among these techniques, CBD is one of the most popular methods to deposit Sb2S3 thin films. The solar cell conversion efficiency obtained from this approach is in the range of 2\u20134% [23,24]. However, this method usually requires a precise control over the temperature of the solution below 10\u202f\u00b0C. Most of the deposited films are amorphous, and need to be annealed at a high temperature for them to crystallize. The final product inevitably includes some impurities, such as SbOCl, Sb2O3, and Sb(SO3)3, which consequently, retard the performance of the solar cells due the recombination of charge carriers. Sb2S3 thin films have also been prepared by rapid thermal evaporation deposition (RTE) for planar solar cells that had a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.5% [25]. Nevertheless, RTE, spray pyrolysis deposition and atomic layer deposition (ALD) usually involve complicated processing steps and require precise control over factors such as the rate of temperature increase and the carrier-gas flow rate. Compared with the above methods to fabricate Sb2S3 thin films, hydrothermal synthesis is a wet chemistry method that allows for easy control over the overall growth rate and does not require any sophisticated instruments. Sb2S3 nanocrystalline particles have already been synthesized hydrothermally as rods [26,27], tubes [28,29], wires [30] and microstructures [31\u201333]. Chen et al. introduced a one-step approach to prepare Sb2S3 nanotubes under hydrothermal conditions with EDTA acting as a structure-directing agent [29]. Qiao et al. synthesized Sb2S3 nanorods from the single-source precursors Sb(S2CNEt2)3 via hydrothermal treatment [27]. Han et al. prepared Sb2S3 microcrystallines with three-dimensional (3D) olivary superstructures via a hydrothermal process using SbCl3 and Na2S as raw materials without any surfactants [33]. Liu et al. deposited high-quality Sb2S3 thin films via a facile hydrothermal reaction and post-annealing process. This environment-friendly synthetic method for preparation of Sb2S3 films employed nontoxic precursors without any complexing agents [34]. However, until now, few attempts have been made to deposit crystalline Sb2S3 thin films on conductive glass substrates by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Herein, we demonstrate a facile one-pot hydrothermal process to fabricate nanocrystalline Sb2S3 thin films with a honeycomb-like structure on ITO glass. We propose a possible reaction process and growth mechanism for the formation of the Sb2S3 thin film, which was controlled by the reaction time, temperature and quantity of PVP. The PEC properties of the Sb2S3 films were also studied.  All of the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. First, 0.04\u202fM antimony potassium tartrate and 0.2\u202fg PVP (K 30) was dissolved in 30\u202fmL deionized water in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50\u202fmL volume). (Safety precaution: antimony potassium tartrate is poisonous and corrosive. It should be treated in a fume hood with appropriate safely considerations: face shield and nitrile gloves). Then, 0.08\u202fM thioacetamide (TAA) was added to the solution with magnetic stirring for 35\u202fmin at room temperature to form a homogeneous precursor solution. The ITO-coated glass (Sn: In2O3, surface resistance of 7\u202fO/sq, transmittance \u226577%, Zhuhai Kaivo Electronic Components Co., Ltd, 40\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fmm with a thickness of 1.1\u202fmm) was washed sequentially with acetone, ethanol and distilled water under ultrasonication for 30\u202fmin. The pretreated ITO substrate was placed at an angle against the wall with the conductive side facing down and the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was sealed. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 180\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh in an electric oven, after which, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, the sample was taken out, rinsed with a copious amount of distilled water and then dried in ambient air. The phase and the crystallinity of the as-obtained samples were investigated by XRD with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.541\u202f\u00c5, Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer). For comparative analysis, a film of Sb2S3 heated at 300\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin under a nitrogen atmosphere was also examined by XRD. The morphologies of the samples were obtained using FESEM (HITACHI S-4800) using an accelerating voltage of 10\u202fkV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained with a JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission microscope. UV\u2013vis reflection spectra of the film were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2550; these spectra were then converted to absorption and band gap spectra. The PEC properties were probed using a conventional three-electrode system that was made of a quartz cell and a linked electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, model CHI660E). The as-synthesized Sb2S3 film was used as the working electrode, a platinum mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was a neutral 0.5\u202fM Na2SO4 aqueous solution. PEC properties of the Sb2S3 electrode were also studied in an acidic solution containing 0.1\u202fM ascorbic acid and 0.1\u202fM Na2SO4. Sunlight was. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "simulated with a 500\u202fW xenon lamp (CEL-S500L) and the light intensity was calibrated for air mass (AM) 1.5 light at 100 mW cm\u22122.  Fig. 1 displays typical XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and heated Sb2S3 films. Both patterns showed sharp diffraction peaks and matched quite well with the standard diffraction data of Sb2S3 (JCPDS File No. 06-0474, space group Pbnm 62). According to the Scherrer formula, the average particle size in the as-synthesized Sb2S3 films was estimated to be 24\u202fnm, indicating the nanocrystalline nature of the film. After the Sb2S3 film was heated at 300\u202f\u00b0C, the average particle size in the film increased to 30\u202fnm. All the other peaks of the XRD patterns originated from the ITO substrate (JCPDS File No. 44-1087) and no peaks from elemental Sb were detected, indicating the formation of a high purity film. In addition, we checked the resistance of the patterned ITO surface and found no obvious decrements. The photograph in the top right of Fig. 1 reveals that the ITO glass was covered by dark brown Sb2S3, which adhered to the ITO substrate firmly without any observable exfoliation. Fig. 2 a, b shows the typical surface FESEM images of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 thin films. The images of the morphology of the thin films at different locations and magnifications reveal that the whole ITO substrate was covered uniformly with an interconnected honeycomb-like structure. The wall thickness between the honeycombs typically ranged from 50\u202fnm to 80\u202fnm. In Fig. 2c, the cross-sectional image shows that numerous honeycombs densely distributed on the substrate with a whole film thickness of approximately 360\u202fnm. The corresponding EDX spectrum shown in Fig. 2d indicates the presence of Sb and S with of ratio of 1:1.6, close to the stoichiometric composition of Sb2S3. The observed carbon signal might come from the graphitic conductive adhesive and pollutant on the film. Fig. 3 a and b display representative TEM and HRTEM images of a fragment of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 film peeled from the ITO substrate. The HRTEM image exhibited clear lattice fringes with spacing of approximately 0.504\u202fnm, which is consistent with the interplanar spacing of (1\u202f2\u202f0) planes of stibnite Sb2S3 and suggests good crystallinity of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 films. To understand the formation of the Sb2S3 films on ITO conductive substrates, time dependent experiments were carried out, and SEM images were used to track the growth process. Fig. 4 a\u2013e show an interesting morphological evolution of Sb2S3 films obtained at different hydrothermal periods. After the ITO substrate was put into the autoclave and reacted for 2\u202fh, numerous Sb2S3 nanoparticles deposited on the ITO surface as shown in Fig. 4a. The distribution was random, and the size of the particles varied between 20\u202fnm and 100\u202fnm. Increasing the hydrothermal reaction time to 4\u202fh, the number of the nanoparticles decreased, while some networks grew across the substrate surface (Fig. 4b). When the reaction time increased to 8\u202fh, there were very few nanoparticles distributed sporadically on the films, whereas the networks spread over the whole substrate, as revealed in Fig. 4c. As the reaction time increased to 12\u202fh, Sb2S3 nanoparticles disappeared completely; Sb2S3 networks with a honeycomb-like structure formed on the ITO substrate (Fig. 4d). Most of the wall between the honeycombs exhibited sharp edges and was several nanometers thick. Sb2S3 honeycombs grew up continuously in both vertical and lateral directions with prolonged reaction times of 16\u202fh, 24\u202fh and 30\u202fh (Fig. 4e, Fig. 2b and Fig. 4f). There were no more changes in the morphology except that the average thickness of the wall increased to approximately 45\u202fnm, 50\u202fnm and 80\u202fnm, respectively. In addition, the variation of the film thickness was analyzed using cross-sectional images, as shown in Fig. 4g\u2013j. In Fig. 4g, the films synthesized for 8\u202fh exhibited uniform morphology with a whole thickness of approximately 220\u202fnm. As the hydrothermal process was prolonged to 12\u202fh and 16\u202fh, the film thickness increased to approximately 260\u202fnm and 310\u202fnm, respectively (Fig. 4h and i). As shown in Fig. 2c, the film thickness reached approximately 360\u202fnm as the reaction time increased further to 24\u202fh. However, when the reaction time was extended to 30\u202fh, the film thickness decreased to 330\u202fnm (Fig. 4j), which may be attributed to the decomposition of the Sb2S3 nanocrystals at the top of the film. In this work, PVP was found to be necessary for the formation of such honeycomb-like Sb2S3 thin films. Hydrothermal synthesis was carried out with different amounts of PVP, while keeping all the other experimental conditions unchanged. As shown in Fig. 5 a, when 0.8\u202fg of PVP was added into the mixed solutions, the thin films were composed of \u201choneycombs\u201d, which was similar to the sample obtained with 0.2\u202fg of PVP. However, when the reaction was performed in the absence of PVP, almost irregularly shaped, large aggregates were observed (Fig. 5b), indicating that PVP was a critical factor for the formation of honeycomb-like Sb2S3 films. As a structure-directing agent, PVP has been extensively used in the solution-phase synthesis of various types of nanomaterials, where it is generally considered to be a steric stabilizer or a capping agent that protects the product from agglomeration. PVP is an organic polymer containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The pyrrolidone group (hydrophilic) could interact with the surface of nanoparticles, serving as a head group, while the inactive polyvinyl group (hydrophobic) serves as tail group, tuning the distances among adsorbed head groups [35]. Accordingly, in the present hydrothermal system, it is reasonable to speculate that the head groups of PVP molecules might bind to (Sb2S3)Sb3+ and Sb3+ and distribute them uniformly in a cross-linked chelate. Moreover, PVP may attach selectively to some planes of the Sb2S3 particles and decrease the growth rate of the facets. The ITO substrate was covered uniformly with this moderately cross-linked chelate, resulting in the formation of the honeycomb-like Sb2S3 films. In the absence of PVP, the reaction only produced many irregular micrometer-sized aggregates of Sb2S3 particles. This indicated that the initially formed Sb2S3 nanoparticles had a strong tendency to aggregate as larger particles when. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "no protective agent was added. Based on the morphology images observed for different reaction times and the above discussion, a possible film-forming process during the hydrothermal reaction is discussed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 6 . In the initial stage of the reaction, tiny Sb2S3 nuclei could electrostatically adsorb to and form on the surface of the ITO substrate. Some pyrrolidone groups in the PVP molecule attracted (Sb2S3)Sb3+ and some pyrrolidone groups attracted Sb3+ in the reaction system. As the reaction time increased, Sb2S3 nuclei grew, while Sb2S3 networks formed along the polyvinyl backbone between Sb2S3 nanoparticles, which merged with their neighbors. During hydrothermal synthesis, there is an equilibrium between crystal growth and dissolution. Crystal dissolution may occur on surfaces of the Sb2S3 nanoparticles that were not capped by PVP effectively. Reasonably, the walls close to the Sb2S3 nanoparticles grew wider. As Sb2S3 nanoparticles dissolved completely and the nanowalls grew to a certain thickness, Sb2S3 networks formed uniformly on the ITO substrate. In the present study, the reaction temperature played an important role in controlling the formation of Sb2S3 films. Fig. 7 displays SEM images of Sb2S3 thin films synthesized at different temperatures for 16\u202fh. It was found that no honeycomb-like Sb2S3 films formed when the reaction happened at 130\u202f\u00b0C and 150\u202f\u00b0C, only a relatively smooth surface and spherical grains formed (Fig. 7a and b). In Fig. 7c, when the temperature increased to 200\u202f\u00b0C, honeycomb-like Sb2S3 thin films grew on the substrate. The wall thickness between the honeycombs was approximately 100\u202fnm, thicker than that of the films synthesized at 180\u202f\u00b0C. In general, the nucleation and growth rate of nanocrystals increased with increasing temperature. These observations demonstrate that a temperature of 180\u2013200\u202f\u00b0C was optimal for the growth of honeycomb-like Sb2S3 film. The optical properties of the Sb2S3 thin films were investigated by examining the absorption of incident photons. Fig. 8 shows UV\u2013visible absorption spectra of the Sb2S3 thin films synthesized at 180\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh. The Sb2S3 thin film had a wide absorption in the wavelength range of 400\u202fnm to 600\u202fnm, which matches the criterion of a good absorption for photovoltaic materials. Sb2S3 was previously reported to be a direct-allowed semiconductor [36]. The inset shows the band gap of the films estimated from the plots of (\u03b1h\u03bd)2 vs. h\u03bd, which was derived from its corresponding absorption spectrum. By extrapolating the absorption edge by a linear fitting method, the band gap value of Sb2S3 was estimated to be 2.0\u202feV, which is consistent with literature reports [9]. The PEC properties of the as-synthesized and the heated Sb2S3 films were investigated at room temperature in air. Fig. 9 (a)\u2013(c) show the PEC characteristics of the Sb2S3 electrodes in 0.5\u202fM Na2SO4 neutral solution. Fig. 9(a) displays the current density as a function of potential for the as-synthesized Sb2S3 photoelectrode. The sample showed a photoenhancement effect in the negative potential direction under illumination, which is a typical characteristic of a p-type semiconductor for Sb2S3 films. In Fig. 9(b), the photocurrent density as function of time (J-t curve) was measured under intermittent light illumination with a bias of 0\u202fV (vs. RHE). When the light was turned on, the samples displayed spikes, which may have been associated with surface electron-hole recombination. The photocurrent density of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 electrode was approximately \u22120.025\u202fmA\u202fcm\u22122. The stability of the photocurrent was measured to evaluate the stability of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 film. As illustrated in Fig. 9(c), although the photocurrent density had large variation in the first 200\u202fs, the electrode possessed a relatively stable value afterward. On the other hand, the J-t curve of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 electrode was also examined in acidic solution (pH\u202f=\u202f2.5) at a bias of 0\u202fV (vs. RHE, shown in Fig. 9(d)). By using ascorbic acid as the sacrificial electron donor, the photoelectrode showed good reproducibility and stability as the illumination was turned on and off, indicating fast electron transport and efficient separation of the photogenerated holes and electrons in the Sb2S3 photoelectrode. In Fig. 9(e), the constant current density of the photoelectrode acquired during the measurement period of 1\u202fh showed that the as-synthesized Sb2S3 films were highly stable. Also worth noting is that the photocurrent densities of the heated Sb2S3 film were similar to those of the as-synthsized Sb2S3 films (shown in Fig. S1). Although the crystallinity of the film was improved to some extent by heat treatment, the PEC properties of film were not enhanced noticeably. The above results demonstrate that the as-synthesized Sb2S3 crystalline films could be used as photoelectrodes without further heat treatment.  In summary, a facile one-pot hydrothermal method with PVP acting as a structure-directing agent for generating well-crystallized Sb2S3 films has been described. Based on a series of experimental results, we have proposed a possible reaction process and formation mechanism of these honeycomb-like films. This investigation has provided a feasible method to prepare well-crystallized Sb2S3 thin films without further heat-treatment. This simple and facile process may be favorable for the future synthesis of high-quality Sb2S3 films.

These factors all contribute to the unique honeycomb-like structure of the Sb2S3 film."}, {"Q": "How does the high surface area of Sb2S3 films contribute to their unique structure?", "A": "The high surface area of Sb2S3 films allows for a larger quantity of interlayer water, which is then accommodated in the crystal lattice. This leads to the formation of a honeycomb-like structure with a large quantity of interlayer water."}, {"Q": "What is the role of PVP in the generation of Sb2S3 films?", "A": "PVP acts as a structure-directing agent in the generation of Sb2S3 films.

However, long-term oxygen and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation unavoidably cause AF to degrade with brittle discoloration, surface cracks and other defects during using in the outdoor [9\u201311]. Such a serious destruction eventually arises a gradual decline in the mechanical properties of AF, which shortens the service life of AF products and restricts their application [12,13]. To serve extensive requirement, surface modification with a multi-functional stabilizer was proposed by researchers to protect AF from damaging of long-term UV radiation, high-temperature heat loss and surface micro-cracks. As a multi-functional and n-type semiconductor material, the zinc oxide (ZnO) is favored due to its low price, non-toxicity, stable luminescence, oxidation stability and easy availability of raw materials [14]. The attraction of ZnO is also manifested in the relatively wide band gap (3.37\u00a0eV) and large exciton binding energy (60\u00a0mV), which build its wide application in photovoltaic materials, piezoelectric devices, spintronic devices, laser diodes, solar cell displays, gas sensors and quantum dots, etc. [15\u201323]. Typically, the shielding mechanism of ZnO to UV irradiation can be revealed that the UV light projected onto the light stabilizer is absorbed and converted into other forms of energy or eliminated by the way of diffuse reflection [24]. Therefore, different shapes of nano-sized ZnO, such as nano-wires [25\u201327], nano-rods [28,29], nano-sphere [30], nano-tubes [31], nano-belts [32], nano-rings [33], nano-springs [34], nano-cantilever arrays [35] and nano-flowers [36], might become the potential materials to protect polymeric fibers against UV-resistance. To synthesize nano-ZnO, the sol-gel process is widely adopted due to its simplicity and low-cost, high purity, good chemical homogeneity and low calcination temperatures. Chu et al. [37] used two types of sub-micro-sized and nano-sized TiO2/ZnO hydrosols to treat the AF. Katangur et al. [38] modified the AF by coating ZnO NPs with the sol-gel process to improve the photo degradation resistance. Brendan et al. [39] tried to enhance the interfacial strength and UV shielding by the sol-gel method through the deposition of ZnO NPs on the AF surface. Nevertheless, drying the fiber in the air tends to obtain low contents of coordination and the considerably long time for ZnO crystallization causing the large destruction to AF due to its high photocatalytic activity. The supercritical fluid drying (SCFD) technique received universal recognitions because of its advantages to obtaining pure NPs by drying the sol-gel [40,41]. Specifically, the SCFD is capable of extracting the dispersed phase in the gel without destroying the gel network frame structure and simultaneously completing the crystallization of NPs, compared with the air drying. Therefore, supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) with high diffusion ability and low solubility is generally used as a carrier for dyeing, foaming, extraction and drying [42\u201348] as well as a superior solvent for accelerating the gelation process and reducing the re-polymerization in the sol-gel process. Gao et al. [41] successfully obtained metal oxide by using Sc-CO2 to dry metal oxide aerogels synthesized from the epoxide addition sol-gel process. Since removing the solvents and impurities from the sol solution is difficult and expensive, Han et al. [49] prepared ZnO by drying the sol solution of ZnO through SCFD method so that obtain pure ZnO NPs. More interesting is that the SCF has the beneficiary effects to activate the functional groups and induce grafting reaction, thus possibly producing new multi-functional materials [50,51]. Despite goals about applying Sc-CO2 to only preparing ZnO or grafting compounds realized, it has not been reported that drying metal oxide on the polymer surface and simultaneously building chemical linking between them appeared, showing that this work is novel. In the present work, a facile processing technique with two steps to prepare AF-ZnO fibers was designed. Specifically, conventional sol-gel process was used to prepare ZnO NPs-contained sol solution. Then, the AF was soaked in the sol solution to deposit ZnO on their surfaces and sequentially dried in Sc-CO2 fluid for extracting the solvents from the AF surface and accelerating the crystallization of ZnO. The AF-ZnO fibers with a strong binding force of coordination between AF surface and ZnO NPs were developed. Through adjusting the Zn2+ concentrations, the structure, composition and surface morphology of AF-ZnO fibers were systematically studied and their outstanding capacity to block UV irradiation and bond epoxy was received without destroying the mechanical properties.  Para-aramid fiber (AF) (Afcool, 1200D) was purchased from Hebei Silicon Valley Chemical Co., Ltd. (Hebei, China). Zinc acetate (Zn (CH3COO) 2, 99.9%) and urea (99.5%) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Polyethylene glycol with molecular weight of 2000 was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Absolute ethanol (Nuclear, 99.5%) was obtained from Wokai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Acetone (Nuclear, 99.7%) was purchased from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Carbon dioxide (99%) was supplied from White Martins (Shanghai, China). Epoxy resin (E44) and curing agent (Triethylene tetramine) were purchased from Kailuo Chemical Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). All these chemicals were analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. Anhydrous Zn (CH3COO)2 powders were added into 150\u00a0mL ethanol to form five uniformly dispersed solution system with different Zn2+ concentrations (0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02 and 0.025\u00a0mol/L). Then, the urea solution was added to the Zn2+ dispersion system with form of droplets for adjusting pH to 9. The five mixture systems were all added 15\u00a0mL deionized water to initiate hydrolysis of urea and 1.0\u00a0g polyethylene glycol for the purpose of prevent NPs agglomeration. At the same time, the five mixture were separately placed in an oil bath at 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h to obtain a uniform sol solution. The reaction process for synthesizing ZnO NPs is shown in Fig. 1 . Consequently, the ZnO NPs-contained sol solution were successfully synthesized and recorded as ZnO1 to. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "ZnO5 in order of Zn2+ concentrations. Firstly, the AF was washed with the acetone solvent through a soxhlet extraction method at 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h and dried in an oven. The cleaned AF was soaked in above sol solution with a sluggish stirring 30\u00a0min to prepare AF-ZnO fibers, and were sequentially dried in the Sc-CO2 atmosphere at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and 7.5\u00a0MPa for 1\u00a0h. The ZnO NPs would be crystallized and grown on the fiber surface with the solvent and impurities extracted by Sc-CO2 fluid. The coordinated bond would be built between AF surface and ZnO NPs during the drying process. According to the reaction in Fig. 1, the excessive urea generally causes the numerous production of OH groups, which is attached to the ZnO surface and thus form the nano-network structure of ZnO on the fiber surface. The schematic diagram of synthesizing AF-ZnO fibers in the Sc-CO2 was shown in Fig. 2 . These dried fibers were named as AF-ZnO1 to AF-ZnO5 in order of the Zn2+ concentration for convenience. All fibers was fixed on a stainless steel frame in a UV aging test chamber and exposed to a UV lamp (power of 40\u00a0W, length of 1220\u00a0mm, 280\u2013315\u00a0nm) at 60\u00a0\u00b0C with a relative humidity of 60% for different times (24, 72, 120, 168 and 216\u00a0h) following the accelerated photo aging procedure according to Chinese Standard GB/T 14522-93. The crystal structure of all samples was determined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2550VB+/PC, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) with a radiation source of \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01.5406\u00a0\u00c5 (CuK\u03b1, 40\u00a0kV, 200\u00a0mA) following a scanning range of 5.0\u201360.0\u00b0 at a speed of 20\u00b0/min. The infrared spectroscopy of AF and AF-ZnO fibers were recorded by a NEXUS-670 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp, Waltham, MA, USA) with a detection resolution of 4\u00a0cm\u22121 and a wavenumber from 400 to 4000\u00a0cm\u22121. The particle size of ZnO NPs was estimated using Nanoparticle size and Zeta potential analyzer (Litersizer 500, Beijing, China) with a granularity range from 0.5\u00a0nm to 10\u00a0\u00b5m at a sensitivity of 0.1\u00a0mg/mL. The particle size values were calculated by the average of five measurements under a repetition rate of 0.02. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi Co., Japan) was employed to observe the surface and fracture morphologies of single silk picked from AF and AF-ZnO fibers before and after UV irradiation. The functional groups and element analysis of fiber surface were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test using a Thermo Escalab 250Xi spectrometer (AZoNetwork UK Ltd., Manchester, UK) equipped with an Al anode (AlK\u00a0=\u00a01486.7\u00a0eV). The peak of as-contained functional groups in the samples were exported by using the Casa-XPS software with the calibration of the main C1s peak. The UV\u2013vis curve of AF and AF-ZnO fibers with a wavelength range from 200 to 800\u00a0nm was measured on a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (UV3600, Shimadzu) to evaluate their capacity to absorb the UV light through exposing to a UV light source with the intensity of 100\u00a0\u00b5W\u2219cm\u22122 and an excitation wavelength at 365\u00a0nm. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements of pure AF and AF-ZnO fibers were performed on Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer (RF5301PC, Shimadzu) excited at 325\u00a0nm and the wavelength between the range of 360\u2013700\u00a0nm was recorded. The measurement on the thermal properties of pure AF and AF-ZnO fibers was performed using a TGA analyzer (209 F1, Netzsch, Germany) in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere from 50\u00a0\u00b0C to 800\u00a0\u00b0C with a heating rate of 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min. Tensile properties of monofilaments were determined using an XQ-1C computerized mechanical tester from Donghua University with a sample length of 20\u00a0mm and tensile rate of 5\u00a0mm/min, and a minimum of 30 samples was tested for each type of monofilaments. The strength retention of the samples exposed to UV illumination at different times was calculated by Eq. (1): W=IaIb\u2217100% where W is the retention of tensile strength, Ib and Ia are the tensile strength of monofilaments before and after UV radiation. The single fiber pull-out test was done by an electronic microsphere experimental debonding tester (YG163, Wenzhou, China) with a constant speed of 10\u00a0mm/min. The max force during the pull-out test was recorded for further data analysis. Each sample was tested for at least 12 times and the value was averaged. The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) was calculated by following the Eq. (2): IFSS=FA=F\u03c0\u2217D\u2217L where F is the maximum force measured, D is the diameter of the fiber and L is the embedded length of the droplet. The grafting yields of modified fibers were calculated using Eq. (3): M0-MM0 where M and Mo are the weights of modified fibers and AFs, respectively.  The particle size distribution of ZnO NPs were measured to estimate the size values, shown in Fig. 3 a. The relatively narrow distribution scope with an average values of about 65\u00a0nm is conformed from the Fig. 3a, illustrating an excellent distribution effect in the ZnO3 mode, which is beneficial to distributing the ZnO NPs on the fiber surface and decreasing the number of defects the new interface makes. Much similar to the effect of uniform distribution is that the crystal structure of NPs can affect the qualities of bonding to the fiber surface as the wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO has been reported to be capable of bonding with functional groups of carbon fiber surface [52]. Thus, the XRD patterns of ZnO3 was detected and shown in the Fig. 3b. As is consistent to the previous reported studies [30], that mentioned structure was determined in this work following JCPDS (no. 36-1451) as the three peaks of ZnO3 mode between 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 was found with the same theta angles as the PDF card. Based on the previous statements, the deposition of ZnO NPs on the AF surface was conducted by a facile two-steps strategy with fast deposition process and short crystallization periods, thereby providing a high grafting yield of ZnO, listed in Table 1 . The yield values ranging from 14.11% to 34.23% show the highly effective preparation processing using the ScCO2-assisted deposition technique, super to the grafting results of 6.58% [53] and 4.92% [54] only by chemical deposition in the literature.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "On this basis, clever coordination bond between the organic fiber and the inorganic nanoparticle are built without destroying the fiber structure. To further determine the above grafting results, the chemical components of AF and AF-ZnO3 were monitored by the wide-scan, high-resolution and core-level XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4a shows three characteristic peaks of AF corresponding to C1s, N1s and O1s at 285, 400 and 532\u00a0eV, but two extra peaks at 1044 and 1022\u00a0eV corresponding to Zn2p1 and Zn2p3 are observed in the AF-ZnO3, which verifies the existence of ZnO on the fiber surface. When it comes to the difference of chemical peaks of Zn element, the high-resolution Zn2p spectra presented in Fig. 4b is commonly investigated to obtain the energy signal caused by Zn. The chemical signals of Zn2p attached in the AF-ZnO3 are significantly higher and clearer, which is due to the higher ZnO content on the surface of modified AF with drying in Sc-CO2 [55]. The analysis can be confirmed from the increase of the atomic percent of Zn in Table 2 . In addition, compared with the untreated AF, the atomic concentrations of the oxygen and the ratio of oxygen to carbon (O/C) of modified AF were increased from 13.73% to 36.85% and 0.18 to 0.67, respectively. The high oxygen contents in the AF-ZnO3 are caused by the attached OH groups from the ZnO surface. The deconvolution analysis of the C1s and O1s peak was performed to investigate the chemical interaction during the modification process and their results were presented in Fig. 4c\u2013f and Tables 3\u20134 . For C1s core-level spectra of untreated AF (Fig. 4c), there are three peaks at 284.7, 285.6, and 288.0\u00a0eV attributed to C C, C N/C O, and C O bonds, respectively [56]. After treatment with ZnO NPs, a new peak corresponding to C O Zn groups at 283.2\u00a0eV is obtained in the AF-ZnO3 (Fig. 4d) [57], which is due to the excellent physical-chemical properties of Sc-CO2 fluids. It can be described that powerful swelling and dissolving leads the micro-sized molecules dissolved in CO2 to penetrate into the surface of the polymer matrix [58,59] and high diffusion coefficients contributes to a sharp increase of catalytic activity facilitating the reaction between groups [51]. Herein, these special conditions lead to the increasing probability of collision reaction that happened between ZnO NPs and AF surface groups, thus forming the new coordination bond of C O Zn. This also explains why the C O Zn contents are as high as 26.21%. The considerably interesting is that the contents of the oxygen-containing groups (Table 3) have also increased from 28.89% to 40.59%, which is indeed beneficial to strengthen the interface adhesion between the fiber and epoxy [39]. This unusual increase is supported by the establishment of the network structure that gains the rich resources from the massive OH groups on the surface of ZnO NPs. Checking out the O1s core-level spectra is able to find the existence of this constructive groups. It is pointed in Fig. 4e and f that the AF possesses C O and C O groups at 532.4 and 531.2\u00a0eV, respectively, but the AF-ZnO3 shows different compositions (Fig. 4f), which are comprised of both the same C O and new groups that are Zn O C and Zn O OH groups at 530.2 and 529.1\u00a0eV. The high C O Zn and Zn O OH bond contents over 65% in the oxygen groups (Table 4) can explain the produced network structure via the linking of hydrogen bond. Hence, the AF-ZnO fibers surface with high grafting yields has been developed by the ZnO NPs coordination. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectra of the samples. The characteristic peaks of AF are the N H stretching band, stretching vibration of the amide N C O group, the C C bond stretching of the aromatic ring and C O stretching vibration observed at 3435, 1652, 1500\u20131400 and 1109\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively [60]. Compared with the pure AF, the absorption peak at 1109\u00a0cm\u22121 of C O stretching vibration transfers to 1102\u00a0cm\u22121, 1085\u00a0cm\u22121, 1090\u00a0cm\u22121, 1098\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1102\u00a0cm\u22121 after treatment with ZnO in Sc-CO2. Additional peaks at about 460\u00a0cm\u22121 is derived from the Zn-O stretching vibration, which shows a slight blue shift caused by the coordination reaction between fiber and ZnO NPs [61]. Differently, higher intensity of Zn O groups is found in AF-ZnO3 showing that the grafting between ZnO and AF surface in Sc-CO2 is higher than in other fibers. This can be explained that the amounts of chemical groups of the fibers were increased with grafting rich ZnO NPs to its surface so that make the new strong characteristic peak. Higher grafting yield of NPs, stronger intensity of that peak. The crystal structures of AF and AF-ZnO fibers were measured by XRD shown in Fig. 6 . Two main characteristic peaks at 2\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a020.6\u00b0 and 22.9\u00b0 corresponding to the (1\u00a01\u00a00) and (2\u00a00\u00a00) crystal planes, respectively, are observed in pure AF, which are parallel to the axis of polymeric chains [62]. Compared with the untreated AF, the intensities of the two main crystal peaks of modified fibers increase due to the presence of ZnO on the fiber surface. Comparing the modification effects of the treatment with different Zn2+ sources, it can be seen that the intensity of the peak of all AF-ZnO fibers are significantly higher other than the AF-ZnO5, which may be due to the higher ZnO content. In addition, it can be observed from the patterns of AF-ZnO fibers that three new diffraction peaks appear at 2\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a032.97\u00b0, 35.59\u00b0 and 37.45\u00b0, which are in agreement with that of the ZnO assigned to the (1\u00a00\u00a00), (0\u00a00\u00a02) and (1\u00a00\u00a01) lattice planes[63], indicating the successful deposition of ZnO on fiber surface. There are no other diffraction peaks appearing in the patterns of treated AF, so the ZnO has a high purity. The SEM images of pure AF and AF-ZnO fibers are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen in Fig. 7a that the pure AF has a smooth, flat. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "and compact skin without any cracks due to its high crystallization degree. The completely different epidermis are observed from the AF-ZnO fibers in Fig. 7b\u2013j. It is surprising that a uniform dispersion of ZnO NPs is formed on the surface of AF-ZnO fibers. Specifically, numerous bitty particles with shape of cube appear on the AF-ZnO1 surface (Fig. 7b, c). Different from the loose distribution, the AF-ZnO2 (Fig. 7d, e) shows a denser stacking of spherical ZnO particles, thereby forming the nano network structure with intensive coverage. With the continuous increase of Zn2+ concentration, the full and round sphere-liked particles are found on the AF-ZnO3 (Fig. 7f, g) surface and where the NPs disperse evenly. While the concentration is excessive, the NPs on the fiber surface have inevitably accumulated to form a layer of ZnO and a certain cudgel shape arises (Fig. 7h, i). In contrast to the particle shape, as shown in the Fig. 7j, a thick ZnO layer is formed in the AF-ZnO5 due to high ZnO contents in the ZnO5 solution. Noting that the well-packed, regular and tightly attached ZnO NPs are observed on the AF-ZnO3 surface treated with the ZnO3 sol solution, suggesting that that Zn2+ concentration at 0.015\u00a0mol/L is appropriate for the deposition of ZnO NPs. In addition, the formation of chemical bonds could be reflected from certain images like Fig. 7c or e that the NPs have attached closely on the surface, so the modification of these fibers would be beneficial to its interfacial adhesion with epoxy matrix. It is well known that UV light received on earth ranges from 280 to 400\u00a0nm and AF with numerous amide bond is susceptible to be damaged by UV irradiation within this wavelength scope [64]. Thus, the UV\u2013vis spectrum of samples within the wavelength of 200\u2013800\u00a0nm is present in Fig. 8 a. All fibers exhibit two typical absorption peak at 286\u00a0nm and 394\u00a0nm but the AF-ZnO fibers which have an additional one at 370\u00a0nm due to the presence of ZnO. Compared with the peaks ranged from 200 to 400\u00a0nm of pure AF, the AF-ZnO fibers modified in Sc-CO2 possess larger intensity, indicating that the ZnO with a wide band gap made great contributions in blocking UV irradiation during the exposure of AF to UV light. Since the AF-ZnO3 owns the strongest absorption value at both 286 and 394\u00a0nm, it is adequately convinced that the AF with smaller and richer ZnO particles have the biggest ability to improve the UV resistance than the other five kinds of fibers [65]. Fig. 8b gives the PL spectra of AF and AF-ZnO fibers in the wavelength from 360\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm. The six types of fibers show the same peak at 490\u00a0nm with an exceedingly wide extension after the excitation light acts. While the pure AF is different from the ZnO coordinated AF where the higher intensity is received between 400 and 700\u00a0nm, which is due to the enhancement of green band of ZnO in the process of being stimulated. That unique green band is generally explained by the radial recombination of a photo generated hole with the electron in a singly ionized oxygen vacancy [66]. Interestingly, the AF-ZnO3 manifest the highest intensity among all kinds of fibers when an exciton-exciton collision occurs on the fiber surface, indicating that the synthesized ZnO on the AF-ZnO3 fiber surface is richer in oxygen vacancies and wider in green band, which contributes to stronger UV absorption [9]. Fig. 9 shows the TGA and DTG curves of the pure AF and AF-ZnO fibers. From the TGA curves, two segments of obvious decomposition appears in AF: the first stage from 50 to 150\u00a0\u00b0C is due to the release of moisture adsorbed by AF, causing a slight loss of weight; then the second stage is the thermal decomposition stage from 520 to 608\u00a0\u00b0C, which is mainly related to the severe degradation reactions, cross-linking, or carbonization reactions [67\u201369]. Specially, AF and AF-ZnO3-Anneal show a high stability as they do not undergo intensive decomposition until 520\u00a0\u00b0C in a nitrogen atmosphere while the AF-ZnO3 send a decrease signal at 420\u00a0\u00b0C. In the stage of 420\u2013520\u00a0\u00b0C, the OH groups on the ZnO surface is removed at high temperature and give rise to the weight loss of AF-ZnO3, which is confirmed by the high weight retentions of the AF-ZnO3-Anneal that was annealed under 420\u00a0\u00b0C for twenty minutes, further explaining the violent increase of oxygen concentrations in the XPS results. In addition, the ZnO coordinated AF exhibits a higher degradation temperature and residual mass than pure AF, demonstrating that the higher thermal stability is obtained by the AF-ZnO fiber. In the DTG curve, slower degradation rate is found in the modified AF than the pure AF, which undoubtedly proves the delayed decomposition in the ZnO NPs-coordinated AF due to the high heat resistance within 800\u00a0\u00b0C. The monofilament tensile properties of pure AF and five kinds of AF-ZnO fibers, including tensile strength and modulus, break elongation and energy, are presented in Fig. 10 . Compared with AF, AF-ZnO fibers have obviously higher tensile properties but the AF-ZnO-5 shows a minor reduction because of the use of excess base. Specifically, the tensile strength and modulus, break elongation and energy of AF-ZnO fibers increase by 0.8\u201313.7%, 0.5\u20138.7%, 0.3\u201313.4% and 6\u201315.7%, respectively, so the existence of ZnO is the key to obtain higher tensile properties. Since the modification of AF with ZnO or TiO2 only by sol-gel process need a multiple times of coating and long periods for inorganic materials to crystal in the previous literature [30,37,70], they all show a reduction in mechanical properties. The AF-ZnO fibers have obvious advantages in improving tensile properties as the fibers are processed in Sc-CO2 fluid with not only the few deposition times but also the rapid crystallization speed of ZnO so that causes few damages to AF. To explore the mechanism of the increase in tensile properties, the fracture morphology of fiber after tensile test was observed and shown in Fig. 11 . Pure AF reveals a neat and uniformly shaped. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "fracture port (Fig. 11a). The reason why the phenomenon generates is that the skin of the PPTA fiber possess different structures from the ordered fibrous core, which can be described an amorphous region that is loosely attached to the fibrillary core, and an inconspicuous transition region is existed between them. The surface fibrils is peeled in the form of ribbons with small core damage and eventually broken along the fiber axis pointing to aggregated chain ends with a shape of brittle fracture port, during the process of tensile fracture [71]. However, the fracture tip of AF-ZnO1 presents a long filamentous shape (Fig. 11b). Similar to the shape of AF-ZnO1, the AF-ZnO2 and AF-ZnO3 (Fig. 11c and d) are composed of filamentous disconnection and strip-like tearing, caused by the nano-network of ZnO that covers the defects on the fiber surface and blocks the further expansion of the crack during the tensile process, thereby producing longer micro fibrils [72]. This process absorbs the energy and thus increasing tensile strength and energy to break. When the ZnO particles on the fiber surface tend to form agglomeration, the stress concentration points generally increase and leads to macroscopic cracks so that make the performance decrease [65], as the AF-ZnO4 (Fig. 11e) and AF-ZnO5 (Fig. 11f). Therefore, the coordination of ZnO with AF can effectively prevent the destruction of tensile force. IFSS is usually used to evaluate the interfacial adhesion of AF to the resin and Fig. 12 shows the IFSS of AF and AF-ZnO fibers. Compared with the IFSS value of pure AF, the AF-ZnO fibers increase by 27.2\u201368.2%, of which the highest IFSS growth rate belongs to AF-ZnO3 whose surface is densely stacked by the ZnO nano-network (as shown in SEM figure) and constructed the coordination structure. Considering that nano-network structure would significantly increase the surface roughness of fibers and act as the mechanical anchors, high bond strengths can be improved. Moreover, the numerous OH groups attached on the ZnO surface increase the oxygen functional groups and thus cause an increased surface area for interaction with the epoxy matrix [30]. Since it has been widely reported that IFSS is greatly affected by the surface morphology of the fiber and mostly has a rise within 38.9\u201367% (Table S1) [9,29,70,73\u201375], the ZnO NPs-coordinated AF of which IFSS increased by 68.2% in this study is the owner of better interfacial properties, being conduced to the application of composites fields. The pull-out morphologies of AF and AF-ZnO3 with epoxy matrix were observed by SEM images to confirm the IFSS results, shown in Fig. 13 . It is described in Fig. 13a and b that the AF surface leaves a shallow scratch with an integral morphology maintained after the epoxy micro-droplet was peeled off. However, the AF-ZnO3 surface with a ruined ball and the naked microfiber structure was found from the Fig. 13c and d. This phenomenon implies a strong chemical bond between ZnO and the fiber surface. When the ZnO NPs that are immersed into resin tends to be pulled out, the coordination bond will prevent the separation of particles and make dead destruction on the skin of AF. During this chemical destruction, extra energy would be consumed for the breaks of chemical bonds that the fiber surface contains and thus more mechanical work would be required overcoming the impeding forces that the pull-out process produces. Therefore, the ZnO coordinated fibers obtain a higher IFSS value than the fiber with smooth surface, which, in a way, illustrates an improvement of interfacial adhesion in modified fiber. Fig. 14 gives the XPS results of AF and AF-ZnO3 after 216\u00a0h-UV irradiation for investigating the changes in their chemical composition. As can be seen, the C1s core-level spectra of UV-AF (Fig. 14a) not only have the same three groups as the original fiber, but it also add a new peak at 289\u00a0eV corresponding to COOH group. This might be because the UV irradiation caused large damages to the naked fiber so that leads to the cleavage of amide bond on AF surface. Differently, the UV-AF-ZnO3 (Fig. 14b) still exists small amount of C-O-Zn bond that produced by the same coordination as the previous XPS mentioned and its intensity of COOH peak is quite weak, demonstrating that the 216\u00a0h-UV radiation produces few damages to this ZnO-bonded fiber. To further explore the structural evolution law after 216\u00a0h-UV irradiation, the FTIR spectra of all irradiated fibers is shown in the Fig. 15 . It is observed that the same characteristic groups of AF, such as N H, N C O and C O, are determined in the UV-AF as the previous FTIR analysis. In addition, new peak attributed to the O C O group at 1735\u00a0cm\u22121 is formed in UV-AF due to the destruction of UV irradiation, which is consistent with the XPS conclusions. However, the AF-ZnO fibers after 216\u00a0h-UV irradiation exhibits relatively different results as that carboxyl peak doesn\u2019t appear, illustrating that the great protection from UV irradiation is achieved by constructing the new surface structure on AF surface with ZnO NPs-coordination. Fig. 16 shows the surface morphologies of pure AF and AF-ZnO fibers after 216\u00a0h-UV irradiation. The large ruptures and black speckles of the epidermis are observed in the UV-AF (Fig. 16a), indicating that the UV irradiation causes great destructions and cleavages of chemical bonds. However, the ZnO NPs-coordinated AF with 216\u00a0h-UV irradiation only show some speckles and a rough skin in the UV-AF-ZnO1 and UV-AF-ZnO5 (Fig. 16b and f). Note that the surface of UV-AF-ZnO2 (Fig. 16c) and UV-AF-ZnO4 (Fig. 16e) with the remaining of ZnO particles appears scant damages from UV irradiation, not to mention the numerous particles-retained surface in UV-AF-ZnO3 (Fig. 16d), indicating that nano-sized ZnO can effectively protected AF from destruction caused by UV irradiation. The single-fiber tensile strength of AF and AF-ZnO fibers after 216\u00a0h-UV irradiation was investigated shown in Fig. 17 . It can be seen that all irradiated fibers present a reduction in tensile strength retentions, but the ZnO-coordinated fibers possess larger strength retentions than the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "pure AF, suggesting that the as-prepared ZnO NPs plays a key role in blocking UV irradiation to AF, as discussed in the SEM results. Especially, the UV-AF-ZnO3 has the highest retentions, of which retentions on tensile strength, tensile modulus, break elongation and break energy are as high as 93.1%, 96.5%, 98.1% and 94.6%, respectively, higher than UV-AF of 73%, 85.7%, 91.2% and 76.3%, respectively. Compared with the retentions of tensile strength between 75.9% and 93.4% (Table S2) [29,30,53,65,70], this work on deposition of ZnO NPs with the assistance of Sc-CO2 fluid made great progress in improving UV resistance for AF. The fracture morphology of irradiated fibers after tensile tests were recorded by SEM images to evaluate the UV resistance. As shown in Fig. 18 , the UV-AF (Fig. 18a) is tore so seriously that only part of bifurcation left and bending micro fibrils is observed, which is due to the defects produced by UV irradiation. The same large bifurcation phenomenon occurs in the UV-AF-ZnO5 (Fig. 18f) but its fracture surface is flat and orderly, while UV-AF-ZnO1\u00a0~\u00a0UV-AF-ZnO4 (Fig. 18b\u2013e) almost maintains the basic morphology of its original fiber only with slight tearing. This is because the ZnO particles can absorb and transfer the energy of UV irradiation and thus protect the fiber, but their photocatalytic activity also produce defects on AF surface, consequently, leading to damages to fiber and reduction of tensile properties. With careful observation, the fracture tips of UV-AF-ZnO2 (Fig. 18c) and UV-AF-ZnO3 (Fig. 18d) still contain curly filaments due to the existence of ZnO on their surface, which conforms the efficacy of ZnO NPs that makes strong interaction between fillers and fibers, thus forming high mechanical properties. Therefore, the compactness and uniformity of ZnO NPs are the key factor that determines the UV resistance of fibers.  The facile design with the supercritical fluid drying technique has been proved to be feasible for preparing AF-ZnO fibers with excellent interfacial-adhesion properties and UV resistance by bridging ZnO NPs on AF surface with the formation of coordination bond between them. The generated C-O-Zn bond was proved by XPS, FTIR and XRD. Through changing the Zn2+ concentrations for synthesizing ZnO NPs, the surface structure and performances of AF-ZnO fibers are adjustable and the optimum conditions on the as-prepared fibers were determined. For the optimal AF-ZnO3, its IFSS increase by 68.2% compared with the pure AF, meanwhile the retention of tensile strength after 216\u00a0h-UV irradiation is as high as 93.1%. Meanwhile, the extraordinary thermal resistance and higher tensile properties including tensile strength, modulus, elongation and break energy are also reported in the optimal fibers. Findings show that this facile processing technique is greatly conducive to develop ZnO coordinated AF with highly improved interfacial-adhesion properties and UV resistance with no destruction.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The mechanisms of charge carriers generation, injection, transport, recombination and collection by electrodes are determinant for the performances of the devices based on organic semiconductors. The parameters of the devices are affected by the radiation absorption, misalignment of the energetic levels inside the heterostructure and morphology of the layers in contact with electrodes [1\u20133]. The main limitation of the organic devices\u2019 performances comes from the low mobility of the charge carriers. Therefore much attention is paid to the identification of mobility limiting factors and development of different ways to improve this parameter. Beside the synthesis of new organic semiconductors, the development of new device structures/configurations represents an alternative for obtaining devices with improved performances. A solution for improving the mobility of the carriers is offered by the nano-patterning of the metallic electrode, which creates an intense electric field on one hand and modifies the contact area between the metallic electrode and organic layer favoring the charge carriers injection/collection, on the other hand [4\u20137]. The nanostructured electrode can reduce both the transit time between the active layer and electrode and the recombination of the charge carriers in the layer. The geometrical parameters of the nanostructures are crucial for improving the charge carriers transport in the organic heterostructures [8,9]. Single/multi layer organic heterostructures with conventional (flat) and patterned metallic electrode will be prepared using the following small molecule organic semiconductors: p type conduction zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), with EHOMO\u202f=\u202f5.17\u202feV, ELUMO\u202f=\u202f3.78\u202feV, as donor and n type conduction Buckminsterfullerene (C60), showing a high electron mobility determined by the highly conjugated nature of fullerene molecules, with EHOMO\u202f=\u202f6.1\u202feV, ELUMO\u202f=\u202f4.4.eV [10], as acceptor. A layer of aluminum (Al) with a work function of 4.1\u202feV [11] has been used as metallic electrode. The absorption of light in the active layer of ZnPc generates excitons and these excitons dissociate at the interface C60/ZnPc. But C60 is also a light absorbing material and this property can affect the electrical behavior of the organic bi-layer heterostructure C60/ZnPc. The parasitically absorption of C60 transport layer [12] in the visible range can cause a decrease in the overall photon density in the ZnPc active layer. This determines a decrease in the number of generated excitons and a decrease in the resulted charge carriers with effect on the transport properties of the heterostructure. To reduce this phenomenon it is proposed to use a buffer hole blocking layer of a wide band gap semiconductor such as 1,4,5,8-naphthalene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA) with EHOMO\u202f=\u202f8\u202feV, ELUMO\u202f=\u202f4\u202feV [12], which does not absorb in the visible range of the solar spectrum and does not generate an energetic barrier for electrons at the contact with C60 layer. A high attention was also paid for developing new transparent conductor electrodes (TCE) with good optical and electrical properties compatible with both rigid and flexible substrates at low prices, an alternative being offered by TCE based on ZnO [13\u201317]. Considering the particularities of the electrode patterning process, we have selected an inverted configuration for organic heterostructures (Fig. 1 ) characterized by a bottom Al electrode deposited on Si substrate and a TCE formed from three successive layers of zinc oxide (ZnO), gold (Au) and ZnO deposited on top of the organic layer(s). The interest for this type of multi layer TCE is justify precisely by the possibility to obtain cheaper devices with improved performances decreasing or avoiding the consumption of limited natural resources like indium, which is utilized for the preparation of ITO electrode [18\u201323]. The stability of the electrical properties of the triple layer TCE is significant in comparison with the frequently used single-layer oxide film and the intermediary metallic layer of Au assures the improvement of the mechanical properties [18]. This paper presents a comparative study between the properties of the heterostructures realized with C60, ZnPc, C60/ZnPc and NTCDA/C60/ZnPc on Si substrate covered by Al flat layer and the same heterostructures realized on Si covered by a 2D array of nanostructures developed in the Al layer. The triple layer TCE, ZnO/Au/ZnO, has been used for all the heterostructures. The simultaneous effect of patterned Al electrode and triple layer TCE on the properties of single/multi layer organic heterostructures has been analyzed. The influence of the NTCDA buffer layer on the properties of the bi-layer (C60/ZnPc) organic heterostructure has also been investigated.  The single/multi layer organic heterostructures have been prepared by vacuum evaporation in inverted configuration on a metallic electrode. The metallic electrode was a flat Al layer (Fig. 1a) or a nano-patterned Al layer (Fig. 1b). The UV-Nanoimprint Lithography, UV-NIL, (Fig. 2 ) was utilized for patterning using an EVG 620 mask aligner, a Brewer Science Cee 200X Spin Coater and an EV Group soft stamp. We have obtained a 2D array of nanostructures with cylindrical shape (holes/pillars) in a polymer layer of photoresist. This array is characterized by a periodicity of 1.1\u202f\u03bcm and the following geometrical parameters: diameter\u202f=\u202f400\u202fnm, depth/height\u202f=\u202f300\u202fnm, determined by the patterning conditions: photoresist deposition by spin coating (speed and time), soft stamp pattern and contact mode parameter (vacuum contact pressure). After cleaning in alcohol isopropyl, the Si substrate is heated at 150\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fmin and successively covered by primer and photoresist deposited by spin coating, the deposition of each layer being followed by a thermal treatment at 120\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fmin. The soft stamp (mold) representing the negative of patterning structures is placed over the photoresist material and pressed at a uniform contact pressure of 100\u202fmbar. After this, the photoresist is solidified by UV exposure for 90\u202fs. At the end of this process, the stamp is removed from the substrate and it leaves the pattern in the polymeric layer. Details about this patterning technique have been previously presented [24]. The patterning has been realized in the same conditions for all samples. The Al electrode was deposited by sputtering on the surface of the nano-patterned photoresist with a UHV-Deposition System (Bestec) in the following deposition conditions: pressure in the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "chamber\u202f=\u202f1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127 mbar, duration of deposition\u202f=\u202f2\u202fh. The thickness of the metallic film measured with a profilometer Ambios Technology XP 100 was \u223c70\u201380\u202fnm. The flat Al film was been deposited on photoresist covered Si substrate by vacuum evaporation using a Kurt J. Lesker SPECTROS equipment at a pressure of \u223c10\u22126 mbar and deposition rate of 2\u202f\u00c5/s. Small molecule organic films have already been deposited on different substrates by vacuum evaporation [25\u201327]. Films of ZnPc, C60 and NTCDA have been deposited by vacuum evaporation using an Alcatel system with a turbomolecular pump assuring a pressure <10\u22125 mbar and a self sustainable winding as heating element. Details about the deposition system have been presented in previous papers [27,28]. The thickness of the organic films deposited on flat Al (\u223c50\u202fnm for C60, \u223c170\u202fnm for ZnPc and \u223c120\u202fnm for NTCDA) was measured by profilometry, being the average value of three measurements. The TCE was obtained by successively sputtering deposition of ZnO, Au and ZnO layers on top of the organic layer in the following conditions, ZnO: I\u202f=\u202f100\u202fmA, duration 2\u202fmin and Au: I\u202f=\u202f25\u202fmA, duration 17 s. In all depositions, the distance substrate-source was 4\u202fcm and pressure in the deposition chamber was 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123 mbar. The total thickness of the triple layer TCE (Fig. 1) was evaluated at \u223c35\u202fnm, the thickness of the component ZnO and Au layers being measured by profilometry. Details about the triple layer TCE preparation have been presented in a previous paper [18]. The organic heterostructures realized on Si covered by flat and patterned Al have been characterized by optical measurements including reflectance (R) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The reflection spectra of the single/multi layer organic heterostructures have been obtained in the spectral range 250\u2013950\u202fnm with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 45 UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere with illumination at 8\u00b0. The PL spectra have been drawn with an Edinburg Instruments F-900 Spectrofluorometer (\u03bbexcitation\u202f=\u202f335\u202fnm, measurement range\u202f=\u202f350\u2013650\u202fnm, slit\u202f=\u202f3; \u03bbexcitation\u202f=\u202f435\u202fnm, measurement range\u202f=\u202f450\u2013850\u202fnm, slit\u202f=\u202f3). The effect of the Al electrode nano-patterning on the morphology and surface topography of the organic films and the triple ZnO/Au/ZnO layer deposited on top of the organic heterostructures has been investigated. The morphology was investigated by SEM using a Zeiss EVO 50XVP microscope at an acceleration voltage, Vacc\u202f=\u202f20\u202fkV and a JSM-6301F JEOL microscope at Vacc\u202f=\u202f3\u202fkV at a magnification of 40\u202fkX. The AFM measurements giving details about the topography of the layers\u2019 surface have been performed with a MultiView Nanonics 4000 System working in tapping mode: probe diameter\u202f=\u202f20\u202fnm; vibration frequency \u223c38\u202fkHz, factor of merit \u223c1800, scan resolution\u202f=\u202f256 lines, scan area\u202f=\u202f10\u202f\u03bcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f\u03bcm, scan speed\u202f=\u202f6.12\u202flines/s. We have obtained information about the roughness of the layers evaluating the amplitude parameters like root-mean-square (RMS) and roughness average (RA) with MSxM 4.0 Develop 11.4 software. The I-V plots in dark, at normal pressure and room temperature, for the single/multi layer organic heterostructures deposited on Si/Al flat and Si/Al patterned substrates, have been recorded in a transversal configuration and 2 wires contact geometry [29\u201331], 1 contact on top ZnO film and 1 contact on Al film, using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter.  All the organic heterostructures were realized using shadow masks, one for the deposition of organic film(s) and one for the deposition of triple layer TCE (Fig. 1). As consequence, the shape of the reflectance spectra is the result of overlapping reflection of ZnO film deposited on top, with reflection of ZnPc or C60 organic film and reflection of Al flat or patterned layer (Fig. 3 ). The contribution to reflectance of ZnO thin film is low because it is known that ZnO shows low reflectance, being an important material for anti-reflection coatings [32]. The triple layer ZnO/Au/ZnO shows a large transparency domain in visible between 370\u202fnm and 900\u202fnm, as presented in a previous study [18]. Strong reflection peaks could appear in the reflection spectrum of Al flat electrode when the frequency of the incident radiation matches the frequency of the surface plasmons generated at the surface of Al film. The behavior of patterned Al layer is a consequence of the interference and scattering phenomena inside the patterned holes determined by the geometrical parameters such as the depth (height) and diameter (width), and the quality of patterned nanostructures with effect on the refractive index. The quality of patterning is determined by the holes/pillars walls verticality and the roughness of the surface [33]. The reflectance value depends on how large is the flat region of the patterned Al layer surface assuring the coupling of the incident radiation to plasmon excitation and affecting the resonance phenomena. Both flat and 2D nano-patterned Al layer are partially covered with single/multi layer organic which also exhibits a significant reflectance in visible (Fig. 3). A reflection occurs at the surface of the organic because of the difference between the refraction index of air and organic. The surface of organic can be flat (the patterning is not preserved) or the surface is patterned, preserving the 2D arrays of nanostructures developed in the Al layer. The reflectance behavior is not correlated only with the roughness of the organic layer surface but also with other optical properties of organics, such as absorption. Thus, the peaks situated around 520\u202fnm and 670\u202fnm in the reflectance spectrum of the heterostructure realized with ZnPc on flat Al layer (Fig. 3a) can be attributed to interference phenomenon in the thin Al film, while the drop in reflectance value situated at \u223c620\u202fnm and 700\u202fnm (Fig. 3a) matches the strong absorption region in ZnPc [34]. The patterning of the Al electrode has not significantly affected the shape of the reflectance spectrum (Fig. 3a), but there was a red shift of the reflection peaks because of the increased interaction between the molecules of ZnPc in the small volume of the holes obtained by patterning. The reflectance spectrum of the heterostructure with C60 layer on flat Al layer (Fig. 3b) shows a large band situated between 380\u202fnm and 650\u202fnm. This band can be obtained by superimposing the peak situated at 520\u202fnm, associated with the interference in flat Al film, with the absorption peak of C60 situated at. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "\u223c450\u202fnm. The last peak is preserved in the reflectance spectrum of the sample with Al patterned electrode and the shaping of a weak shoulder at \u223c600\u202fnm is remarked [35]. A slight red shift of the reflection peaks is observed for the samples with patterned Al electrode, because of the increased interaction between the C60 molecules in the volume delimited by the holes obtained by patterning. At wavelength >600\u202fnm, the reflectance spectrum is not significantly affected by the C60 film absorbance because the strong characteristic absorbance peaks of fullerene are situated in the UV region (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f210\u202fnm, 260\u202fnm, 330\u202fnm [35\u201337]). Hence, the shape of the reflection spectra of the heterostructures with single organic layer of ZnPc or C60 is not significantly affected by the patterning of Al film, but the peaks are slightly red shifted. For bi-layer organic heterostructures, C60/ZnPc (Fig. 3c) deposited on non-patterned Al layer it has been remarked a strong reflection peak situated at \u223c520\u202fnm and a very weak one at \u223c670\u202fnm corresponding to interferences in Al film. The peak situated at 670\u202fnm became stronger in the reflection spectrum of the heterostructure realized on patterned Al layer being correlated with an increased coupling between the incident radiation and plasmons generated at Al surface. In the heterostructure with bi-layer organic C60/ZnPc, the reflection is affected by scattering and interference phenomena in the holes developed by patterning in the Al layer. The patterning of the electrode affected the reflectance spectra of multi layer organic heterostructure, NTCDA/C60/ZnPc, which shows a slightly fluctuated shape of the reflectance spectrum characterized by a succession of small maxims and minims (Fig. 3d). This behavior can be correlated with the delete of patterning by the succession of multi layer organic and triple layer TCE, filling the patterning holes as evidenced on SEM (Fig. 6 h) and AFM (Fig. 7 h) images, and with a low roughness of the surface of top ZnPc and ZnO layer (Fig. 1, Table 1 ). The reflectance measurements of heterostructures deposited on flat Al are significantly affected by the presence of TCE: the diffuse reflectance has increased because the triple layer TCE has determined an increase in the roughness of the organic layer on which it is deposited (Table 1). A rough surface of ZnO determines an increase of the diffuse reflectance because it randomly scatters the reflections which can be lost by destructive interferences [38] with the reflections coming from organic and Al layer\u2019s surface. By comparison, a smooth, nearly flat, surface reduces the diffuse reflectance and destructive interference assuring a dominant constructive interference between the reflections coming from ZnO, organic (C60 or ZnPc) and Al layer surface. The lower diffuse reflectance was shown by ZnPc, C60/ZnPc and NTCDA/C60/ZnPc layers deposited on low roughness, flat Al electrode (Table 1). The patterning of Al determines a high increase in the roughness (rougher surface) of single layer organic (C60 or ZnPc). The roughness increase is lower (smoother surface) in bi (C60/ZnPc) and three (NTCDA/C60/ZnPc) layer organic heterostructures and it is correlated with the particularities of the organic molecules arrangement inside the patterning holes of the 2D array of nanostructures, determining the partial or complete filling of the holes\u2019 volume. The PL emission of the heterostructures is dominated by the behavior of patterned Al [20]. At illumination with \u03bb\u202f=\u202f335\u202fnm, the most heterostructures built on flat Al layer have shown only a weak peak situated at \u223c500\u202fnm, which can be correlated with reduced resonance phenomena between the incident light and the surface plasmons generated in Al layer These resonance phenomena became intense by patterning the Al layer and the shape of the emission spectra has been affected, showing a narrow strong peak at \u223c500\u202fnm and a much weaker one situated at \u223c600\u202fnm (Fig. 4a,b). For the heterostructures with bi-layer organic, the position and shape of the emission peaks in the domain \u03bb\u202f<\u202f500\u202fnm are preserved by patterning and the two peaks mentioned above (situated at 500\u202fnm and 600\u202fnm) are well defined (Fig. 4c). The heterostructure with tri-layer organic deposited on patterned Al has shown a slightly different behavior than the heterostructure with bi-layer organic: the peak situated at \u223c500\u202fnm became stronger and wider, while the peak situated at \u223c600\u202fnm disappeared (Fig. 4d). At illumination with \u03bb\u202f=\u202f435\u202fnm, the shape of the PL spectra of the heterostructures with single, bi-layer and tri-layer organic and triple TCE, realized on patterned and flat Al, show an emission band between 450 and 600\u202fnm (Fig. 5). The shape of the emission spectra is also influenced by the emission peak of the photoresist layer deposited on Si which is situated at \u223c500\u202fnm [24]. The increase in the PL signal of the heterostructures built on patterned Al could be correlated with an energy transfer between the radiation captive in the patterned holes and the surface plasmons [39]. This is a contribution from the Al electrode area which was not covered by the organic film (Fig. 1b), delimited during the deposition process by using shadow mask. SEM images (Fig. 6) have evidenced significant differences between the heterostructures realized on flat (Fig. 6a,c,e,g) and patterned (Fig. 6b,d,f,h) Al only when the organic layer plus TCE layer are not thick enough to fill the volume of patterning holes. When a single organic layer (ZnPc or C60) is deposited on patterned Al, the patterning is preserved in the center of the ZnO top layer (Fig. 6b,d). When multi organic layers plus TCE are successively deposited on the patterned electrode with holes\u2019 depth of 300\u202fnm, the memory of patterning could be deleted, depending on the particularities of the organic molecules\u2019 arrangement inside the holes. This behavior can be evidenced on both SEM (Fig. 6) and AFM (Fig. 7) images. The holes obtained by patterning could be filled fast with organic molecules and after this process many molecules could be deposited on the top surface of the holes favoring the erasing of the patterning (Fig. 6f,h). In the heterostructures with C60 and ZnPc successive layers the patterning holes are filled and the memory of patterning is deleted (Fig. 6f). When. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "tri-layer organic (NTCDA, C60 and ZnPc) is deposited on the patterned Al, the patterning is deleted because of the high thickness of the tri-layer organic (Fig. 6h). The triple TCE layer shows different morphology when it is deposited on organic film covering a flat or a patterned electrode. The patterning has been preserved during the deposition of single layer organic and TCE (Fig. 6b,d). The TCE followed the morphology of the organic film on which it is deposited and any change in the morphology of the organic, determined by the morphology of the deposition substrate and variations in the thermal conditions of deposition, propagates in the TCE. All the samples presented a morphology characterized by grains, which is preserved and very well defined by the triple ZnO/Au/ZnO layer (Fig. 6). The preservation of patterning has also been revealed by AFM (Fig. 7), in the center of the top ZnO layer, on the same samples as by SEM. The AFM images and profile lines have evidenced the existence of the periodic network of nanostructures with a periodicity of 1.1\u202f\u03bcm in the heterostructures with single organic layer (Fig. 7b,d). The AFM images have also revealed the delete of nanostructures in bi-layer organic deposited on patterned Al (Fig. 7f), because the patterning is no more visible and the holes of the pattern seem to be completely filled. The delete of the patterning has also been obtained in the heterostructures with a buffer layer of NTCDA sandwiched between the nanostructured Al layer and C60 film (Fig. 7h). The roughness in the center of the sample is in fact the roughness of the ZnO/Au/ZnO deposited on organic film, preserving the morphological history of the previously deposited films (Fig. 1). The roughness at the edge of the heterostructure is in fact de roughness of the organic layer ZnPc or C60 deposited on Al electrode (Fig. 1). The roughness is higher in the center of the sample compared to edge (Table 1) and on the heterostructures with single layer organic deposited on patterned Al (Fig. 7b,d) compared to flat Al (Fig. 7a,c). The roughness is also much higher for the samples preserving the patterning (Fig. 7b,d) compared to the sample on which the patterning is deleted (Fig. 7f,h). A buffer layer of NTCDA sandwiched between flat or nanostructured Al film and C60 film influenced the morphology and surface topography of the top layer(s), (Fig. 7g,h) and determined a decrease in the surface roughness (Table 1). The depth of the patterning holes, in correlation with the thickness of the organic film(s) and TCE layer, will determine different degree of filling of the holes and different morphology of the top layer, both having influence on the properties of the heterostructure. The topography of the layer surface after the deposition of single/multi layer organic at the interface with triple layer TCE (Table 1) affects the charge carriers collection and electrical properties of the heterostructures. An injection contact behavior was evidence for most heterostructures built both on flat and patterned Al (Fig. 8 ). The film of ZnPc shows a lower roughness because of the planar configuration of this rigid molecule forming column stacks with the ring orientation inclined relative to the axis of the stack. As consequence ZnPc shows different aggregation configurations with effect on the electrical conductivity along these stacks [40]. The heterostructure Si/Al/ZnPc/ZnO/Au/ZnO shows high current and non-linear slightly asymmetric injector contact behavior affected by current limitation mechanisms (Fig. 8a). At an applied voltage of 0.5\u202fV the current is significant, \u223c10\u22125\u202fA (Table 2 ), despite the less favorable position of the energetic level (ELUMO, ZnPc\u202f=\u202f3.78\u202feV [41]). The high current is favored by changes in the electronic properties of ZnPc molecules, because of the strong ZnPc/ZnO coupling [41], which determines a lowering in both HOMO and LUMO levels, the splitting of LUMO and the mixing between LUMO of ZnPc and the conduction band of ZnO [42]. The same structure realized on patterned Al shows, at the same applied voltage, a slightly increased current of \u223c5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22125\u202fA (Table 2), assigned to the larger interfacial area between the patterned electrode and organic (determined by the 2D array parameters) than between the flat electrode and organic. Other effects could be associated with the molecular orientation and crystallinity of the film leading to an increase in the charge carrier mobility even with an order of magnitude [43]. In literature it is reported that mobilities of charge carriers, holes and electrons, are increased by patterning, but a clear explanation for this behavior is still under discussion [44]. I-V characteristic of the sample Si/Al/C60/ZnO/Au/ZnO (Fig. 8b) has revealed a behavior of injector contact showing a current of 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127\u202fA at an applied voltage of \u223c0.25\u202fV (Table 2). The heterostructure with patterned Al electrode (Fig. 8b) is characterized by a non-linear injector contact behavior. The shape of the I-V curve has evidenced the presence of current limitation mechanisms. Both SEM (Fig. 6d) and AFM (Fig. 7d) images have confirmed the presence of a 2D array of nanostructures on the ZnO top layer. Although the energetic levels positions favor the transfer of electron (WFAl\u202f=\u202f4.1\u202feV, ELUMO, C60\u202f=\u202f4.4\u202feV, EHOMO, C60\u202f=\u202f6.1\u202feV [10], ECB, ZnO\u202f=\u202f4.25\u202feV [45], Eg, ZnO\u202f=\u202f3.2\u202feV [45]) and the curved surface of C60 molecules favors their better accommodation in/on the patterned nanostructures, the current value is only of 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129\u202fA at 0.25\u202fV (Table 2) in heterostructures with patterned Al electrode (Fig. 8b). A transfer of the charge carriers from Al to fullerene takes place at the adsorption of C60 molecules in the holes of the patterning [46]. The electrical properties are influenced by the interactions metal-fullerene molecule and fullerene-fullerene molecules and by the conformational flexibility determining the structural adaptation of fullerene molecules inside the holes of the patterning [46]. The electrical behavior could be explained by the hybridization of the C60/ZnO interface recently reported [47], which induces the carriers localization. The electrons are trapped near the electrode and show an increased probability to recombine with holes which are present in the organic layer. The sample Si/Al/C60/ZnPc/ZnO/Au/ZnO (Fig. 8c) shows an asymmetric non-linear. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "injector contact behavior with a current of \u223c5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126\u202fA at 1\u202fV (Table 2). I-V characteristic of heterostructure with patterned Al electrode has became almost symmetrical, the shape revealing the effect of current limitation mechanisms (Fig. 8c). The charge carriers transport is affected by the presence of charge transfer states at the interface between C60 and ZnPc [48]. The adsorption of ZnPc on C60 favors both charge re-organization and charge transfer at the interface, resulting in the formation of interface dipole [49], having a value of 0.06\u202feV for the interface C60/ZnPc [50]. When ZnPc is deposited on top of C60, the interfacial potential levels offset between the HOMO of ZnPc [41] and the LUMO of C60 [10] at the interface C60/ZnPc is of 0.77\u202feV. This high energetic barrier between the donor and acceptor should determine low carrier injection efficiency. But these factors are counteracted by the favorable behavior of the ZnPc/ZnO interface mentioned above [41,42], which is dominant and determines the significant current of \u223c5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126\u202fA through the heterostructure. The current is very low in the heterostructure with bi-layer organic and nanostructured Al electrode (4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221210\u202fA at 1\u202fV, Table 2) because of the changes in molecular orientation. This causes changes in the direction of charge transfer and interface dipole determining strongly anisotropic electronic properties of the interface affecting the charge transport [49]. The structure Si/Al/NTCDA/C60/ZnPc/ZnO/Au/ZnO is characterized by a linear injector contact behavior (Fig. 8d) showing a significant current \u223c4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fA at an applied voltage of 0.7\u202fV (Table 2). An important change in the shape of the I-V characteristic and a symmetric non-linear injection contact behavior has been evidenced in the same structure built on patterned Al. Despite the favorable energetic criteria, the charge transport has been affected by the accommodation of the big, plane molecule of NTCDA [12] on the patterned surface of Al resulting a significant decrease in current (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221210\u202fA at 0.7\u202fV, Table 2). In general, holes charge carriers are difficult to collect because of the short hole\u2019s drift length, but the patterned electrode favors the charge collection because of the increased surface area [51,44]. Theoretically, a high aspect ratio of the pattern (depth/width) can be correlated with enhanced performances of the heterostructure [51]. The increase in surface area for charge collection can be quantified as interface enhancement factor (IEF) [51]. Considering the geometrical parameters of our patterning (widthhole\u202f=\u202f400\u202fnm; depthhole\u202f=\u202f300\u202fnm; periodicity\u202f=\u202f1100\u202fnm) the resulted IEFpatterned Al\u202f=\u202f1.4 compared to IEFflat Al\u202f=\u202f1, which confirms that Al patterned electrode could be used to improve the charge collection. The electrical properties of the organic heterostructures built on this electrode are further determined by the properties of organic semiconductor and interfaces. Recently has been evidenced that another factor affecting the charge transport process in heterostructures with patterned metallic electrode is the non-uniform evolution of the electric field from one electrode to another and inside the patterned metallic electrode, leading to a reduction in the charge collected and favoring the recombination [52,53]. Therefore the increased current evidenced in the heterostructure with ZnPc layer and patterned Al electrode is sustained by the mechanisms favorable to charge transport and collection mentioned above and most likely implies the presence of a uniform electric field inside the heterostructure [53].  In this paper we present a comparative study between the properties of single/multi layer organic heterostructure with triple layer (ZnO/Au/ZnO) transparent conductor electrode (TCE) and conventional flat and patterned Al metallic electrode. The 2D array of nanostructures (holes/pillars) realized by UV Nanoimprint Lithography (diameter\u202f=\u202f400\u202fnm, depth/height\u202f=\u202f300\u202fnm, periodicity\u202f=\u202f1.1\u202f\u03bcm) have influenced the optical and electrical properties of the organic heterostructure with single layer of ZnPc or C60, bi-layer C60/ZnPc and with a hole blocking layer of NTCDA, deposited between the Al electrode and C60/ZnPc stacked layers. The reflectance spectra of the organic heterostructures depend on the coupling of radiation to plasmons generated in the Al film. The shape of the reflection spectra is affected by scattering and interference phenomena in the volume of the holes developed in patterned Al layer and by triple TCE, determining an increase in the surface roughness. The photoluminescence emission of the heterostructures with single/multi layer organic and triple layer TCE was determinate by the effect of Al patterning through the resonance energy transfer between the incident light and surface plasmons generated in Al layer. SEM has evidenced the well defined grains morphology for the organic layer(s) deposited both on flat and patterned Al layer. SEM and AFM measurements have revealed that the holes patterned in the Al layer could be or not filled, depending on the particularities of the organic molecules accommodation on the substrate and thickness of the successively deposited layers. This process determines the morphology of the ZnO layer deposited on top of the heterostructure and, as consequence, the electrical properties. The investigated single and multi layer organic heterostructures with Al flat electrode and triple layer transparent conductor electrode are characterize by high value of the dark current (10\u22124 to 10\u22125\u202fA) for applied voltages <1\u202fV. Therefore, the triple layer ZnO/Au/ZnO could be a potential candidate to replace ITO. The patterning of the Al electrode has determined an enhancement in the current passing through the single layer organic heterostructure, Al/ZnPc/ZnO/Au/ZnO. We investigated the effect of electrode patterning not only on the optical properties, which was mostly analyzed and presented in literature until now, but especially on the electrical properties of the organic heterostructures realized with small molecule organic compounds, in correlation with layers\u2019 morphology and interface\u2019s particularities. This type of investigation is necessary for evaluating the impact of metallic electrode nano-patterning on different organic devices realized with the very promising triple layer transparent conductor electrode, such as the new generation of organic photovoltaics, optoelectronics and electronics.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The conventional TiO2 is the most extensively investigated semiconductor photocatalyst for the decomposition of organic pollutants . However, because of its large band-gap energy (3.2 eV), it can respond only in the UV region of the solar spectrum, which further confines the photocatalytic application in visible region . In order to utilize the abundant visible light in the solar spectrum, it is of crucial importance to develop the photocatalyst that can work under visible light illumination with high efficiency. Thus, the degradation of organic pollutants under visible light illumination is considered to be a promising approach. Recently, several visible light photocatalysts, such as CdS, AgI, Bi2O3, g-C3N4, Cu2O, BiVO4 and Ag2CO3 have been used for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants . Recent years, Bismuth oxy halides BiOX (X = Br, Cl, and I) are considered to be as potential visible light photocatalysts due to their excellent electrical and optical properties. . Among them, BiOI is a promising photocatalyst due to is low bandgap energy (1.8 eV) compared to that of BiOBr and BiOCl . However, rapid electron-hole pair recombination greatly affects the photocatalytic activity of BiOI towards photocatalytic applications . In order to maximize the photocatalytic efficiency of BiOI, several efforts have been put forward, such as doping of metal with BiOI and addition of co-catalysts to form nanocomposites, etc., . For example, BiOI-TiO2 nanocomposites were synthesized using electrochemical deposition and demonstrated as a visible light photocatalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting . Sun et al. has developed a BiOI/BiOCl heterojunction photocatalyst with enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light illumination . A novel Bi2S3/BiOI nanocomposite produced via simple facial approach exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity for methyl orange dye degradation . Very recently, p-n junction heterostructured BiOI/La2Ti2O7 photocatalyst was designed with high photocatalytic activity . In order to further enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiOI photocatalyst, graphene has been utilized as a potential two dimensional solid support for efficient separation and transportation of charge carriers. Graphene, a single layer of graphite has attracted major attention in various fields due to its excellent physicochemical properties, such as high surface area, better electrical conductivity and high carrier mobility etc. . Dai et al. has synthesized ternary C3N4/BiOI/graphene-oxide nanocomposite for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye . Graphene oxide (GO) was used as an electron transporting layer to transfer the photoexcited electrons from C3N4 to BiOI and thereby, suppress the electron-hole pair recombination. Quantum sized BiOI nanoparticles were decorated on reduced graphene oxide sheets and employed as an efficient visible light photocatalyst for methyl orange dye degradation . Likewise, three dimensionally constructed BiOI-GO composite was designed using self-assembly approach and the resultant visible light active 3D BiOI-GO composite showed improved photocatalytic phenol degradation than BiOI and P-25 . Very recently, reduced graphene oxide supported BiOI-AgI photocatalysts were synthesized by simple precipitation method for the efficient degradation of rhodamine B dye under solar light irradiation . In addition, visible light responsive Bi7O9I3/reduced graphene oxide composites were developed and exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity . In the present work, different wt% of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) loaded BiOI photocatalysts were synthesized using simple hydrothermal technique. The photocatalytic performance of prepared BiOI-rGO photocatalyst was evaluated for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye under visible light illumination. Most importantly, introducing different wt% of rGO as a solid support for the BiOI photocatalyst might plays a significant and crucial role in tailoring the morphological nanostructure and the band-gap of BiOI, which further reflected on the photocatalytic activity towards the photodegradation of MO.  Graphite flakes [particle size + 100 mesh (\u226575% min)] was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Bi(NO3)3\u00b75H2O and KI were obtained from SRL Chemicals, India. All other reagents and solvents were of analytical reagent grade and used without any further purification. GO was synthesized from graphite flakes using well known modified Hummer\u2019s method . In a typical procedure, 2 g of graphite flakes and 1 g of NaNO3 were added into 46 mL of conc. H2SO4 and stirred for 30 min. To this, 6 g of KMnO4 was added slowly under ice cold condition to prevent the temperature not exceeding more than 20 \u00b0C. Then this suspension was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Further, 92 mL of DI water was slowly added into the reaction mixture and heated up to 98 \u00b0C for 30 min. To remove the excess KMnO4, appropriate amount of 3% H2O2 was slowly dropped into the mixture until no bubbles were observed. The mixture was centrifuged and washed with Milli-Q water several times until pH reached up to neutral. Finally, the collected products were freeze dried. The BiOI-rGO photocatalyst was synthesized using simple hydrothermal method. 1 mmol of Bi(NO3)3\u00b75H2O was dissolved in 17 mL of ethanol and slowly dropped into 17 mL of DI water containing 1 mmol KI under constant stirring. To this mixture, a required amount of GO was added and stirred for 30 min. Then this suspension was transferred into the 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, heated at 150 \u00b0C for 8 h and cooled to room temperature. Finally, orange colour precipitates were collected, washed with DI water and ethanol several times and dried at 60 \u00b0C. Different weights of rGO (2, 4 and 6 wt%) was loaded with BiOI by hydrothermal method. For comparison, a bare BiOI photocatalyst was also synthesized according to the previous report . X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out by (PANaltical X\u2019pert powder diffractometer) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The morphological studies were obtained through Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEI Quanta FEG 200 HR-SEM). The optical absorption spectra of photocatalyst recorded in diffuse reflectance mode was occurred from Analytikjena specord 210 plus, integrating sphere accessories. Photoluminescence spectra were taken using Horiba Fluorolog@3 spectrophotometer. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra for the photocatalysts were monitored using Agilent, Cary 660, USA. The photocatalytic. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "activity for the photocatalysts were evaluated for the degradation of aqueous methyl orange (MO) dye solution under visible light illumination. A 250 W Xenon lamp (Oriel instrument) was used as a light source (\u03bb > 400 nm). 80 mg of photocatalyst in 80 mL of MO (10 mg/L) was suspended in 100 mL glass beaker. Before light illumination, MO dye with catalyst was stirred under dark condition to attain adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. At a given time interval, supernatant was collected, centrifuged and transferred to 3.5 mL of quartz cuvette for measuring the UV\u2013vis absorbance value. The MO photodegradation was monitored through UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer (Specord-210 plus, Analytikjena, Germany). The rate of mineralization was analyzed using Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer (Shimadzu, TOC-L, Japan).  The XRD patterns of the prepared BiOI and BiOI-rGO photocatalysts are depicted in Fig. 1 . Both BiOI and BiOI-rGO exhibit the high intense diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 24.4\u00b0, 29.7\u00b0, 31.7\u00b0, 33.2\u00b0, 37.0\u00b0, 39.4\u00b0, 45.4\u00b0, 49.8\u00b0, 51.5\u00b0, 55.2\u00b0, 60.1\u00b0, 61.7\u00b0, 65.5\u00b0 and 66.3\u00b0 can be assigned to (101), (012), (110), (111), (013), (004), (014), (006), (114), (122), (115), (024), (016) and (220) planes, respectively (JCPDS # 73-2062) . Thus, all the noted diffraction peaks are related to tetragonal phase of BiOI structure. In addition, the peak intensity clearly indicates that the prepared photocatalysts are well crystallized. Moreover, no diffraction peak for rGO was observed in BiOI-rGO samples, which might be due to the lower loading of rGO . Fig. 2 (a) shows the UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra of BiOI and different wt% of rGO loaded BiOI photocatalyst. The diffuse reflectance data were converted into absorbance data using the Kubelka\u2013Munk method. As can be seen from Fig. 2(a), pure BiOI shows an absorption edge at 680 nm. However, the absorption edge of BiOI-rGO photocatalysts are shifted to more visible region with respect to rGO loading. For example, the absorption edge of 2 wt%, 4 wt% and 6 wt% rGO loaded BiOI photocatalysts are 712 nm, 748 nm and 805 nm, respectively. Thus, the notable shift in the absorption edge of rGO supported BiOI photocatalysts indicates the electronic interaction between rGO sheets and BiOI . The band-gap energy for BiOI and BiOI-rGO photocatalysts were roughly estimated from the following Tauc equation , \u03b1h \u03bd = A(h \u03bd \u2212 Eg)n/2, where, \u03b1 is an absorption coefficient, h is the Planck\u2019s constant, \u03bd is the light frequency, Eg is the band gap energy, A is an empirical constant, and n = 1 for direct transition and n = 4 for indirect transition. The indirect band gap energy of BiOI and BiOI-rGO photocatalysts were calculated from the plot of (\u03b1h \u03bd)1/2 vs. Eg. As displayed in Fig. 2(b), the band gap energy of bare BiOI was estimated to be 1.86 eV. In the case of BiOI-rGO photocatalysts, the band gap was gradually reduced when increasing the loading of rGO. The calculated band-gap energies were 1.75, 1.64 and 1.55 eV for BiOI-rGO (2 wt%), BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) and BiOI-rGO (6 wt%), respectively. Liu et al. reported a band-gap of 1.95 eV for the quantum sized BiOI decorated RGO photocatalyst . A band gap of 1.52 eV for Bi7O9I3/RGO photocatalyst was also reported . It is interesting to note that the incorporation of rGO with BiOI in the present study significantly narrow down the band gap energy and thereby, it may facilitate visible light induced photoreaction process. FE-SEM analysis was carried out to identify the effect of rGO on morphological nanostructures of BiOI-rGO photocatalysts. Fig. 3 (a\u2013d) shows FE-SEM image of BiOI and different amount of rGO supported BiOI photocatalysts. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), pure BiOI and BiOI-rGO (2 wt%) photocatalyst consist of aggregated nanoplates like morphology. It can also be seen that the morphology is transformed from aggregated nanoplates into nanoflowers by increasing the rGO content up to 4 wt% [Fig. 3(c)]. Further increase of rGO content to 6 wt% shows vertically aligned irregular nanoplates structure. Fig. 4 depicts the FTIR spectra of BiOI and BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalyst. The peaks located at 3445 and 1629 cm\u22121 are assigned to the stretching and bending vibration of hydroxyl groups . The absorption peak identified at 1385 cm\u22121 is related to adsorption of OH groups on hydrogen related defects . Most importantly, a peak observed at 479 cm\u22121 is attributed to the stretching vibration of Bi O bonds in BiOI . As shown in inset of Fig. 4, a small shoulder peak noted at 1228 cm\u22121 of BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalyst is assigned to C OH stretching, which indicates the chemical interaction between BiOI and rGO sheet . Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra can be obtained to study the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in the semiconductor photocatalysts. Fig. 5 represents the PL emission spectra of BiOI and rGO supported BiOI photocatalysts, excited at 340 nm. As displayed in Fig. 5, a strong PL emission peak centred at 430 nm indicates the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron hole-pairs in bare BiOI photocatalyst. However, the PL emission peak intensity is significantly quenched for rGO supported BiOI photocatalysts. This result clearly reveals the electrons storing and shutting behaviour of rGO sheet, which induce the electrons transfer from conduction band of BiOI to the conduction band of rGO and thereby largely suppress the electron-hole pair recombination . The photocatalytic activity of the prepared photocatalysts was evaluated for the degradation of MO under visible light irradiation. It is well known that MO is an organic dye which is commonly used in textile industries. It is highly stable and difficult to decompose by the conventional treatment methods . Fig. 6 shows the photodegradation of MO using different photocatalysts under visible light illumination. The effect of different wt% rGO with BiOI in photocatalytic activity was studied under identical experimental condition. The pure BiOI alone shows only 29% of MO degradation [Fig. 6(a)]. The% photodegradation of MO dye with different loading (wt%) of rGO (2, 4 and 6 wt%) with BiOI photocatalyst is 36, 85 and 61%, respectively as. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "shown in Fig. 6(b\u2013d). These results clearly reveal that 4 wt% rGO loaded BiOI shows the highest photocatalytic activity on MO degradation and it was found to be the optimized loading [Fig. 6(c)]. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity is mainly due to the ultrafast carrier separation and charge transportation characteristics of rGO sheet . However, higher loading of rGO affects the photocatalytic performance. The reason is that higher amount of rGO further prevents the direct interaction of light on BiOI surface . Fig. 7 shows the pseudo-first order reaction kinetics of degradation of MO using BiOI and BiOI-rGO photocatalysts. The calculated apparent rate constants (k \u00d7 10\u22123) were 0.52 min\u22121, 0.71 min\u22121, 2.84 min\u22121, 1.49 min\u22121 for BiOI, BiOI-rGO (2 wt%), BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) and BiOI-rGO (6 wt%) photocatalyst, respectively. Thus, the optimized BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalyst shows \u223c5.5 fold higher photocatalytic efficiency than the bare BiOI. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis was performed to understand the mineralization of photodegraded MO solution using BiOI and BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalyst. The % TOC removal of BiOI and BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalysts are calculated to be 14 and 38%, respectively (Fig. 8 ). Thus, the \u223c2.7-fold enhancement achieved using the optimized BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalyst clearly indicates the effective role of rGO for mineralization of MO dye. To enhance the rate of degradation efficiency of the present photocatalytic system, potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) was used, which is commonly used as an oxidising agent along with photocatalysts . Generally, persulfate ions (S2O8 2\u2212) are easily activated via thermal, photochemical, radiolytic or redox decomposition to generate the stronger oxidant of sulfate anion radicals (SO4 \u2212) . In the present photocatalytic system, addition of KPS greatly accelerated the degradation rate, as shown in Fig. 9 . The rate of degradation as a function of different concentration of KPS was studied in detail. As the concentration of KPS increased from 0.5 mmol to 1.0 mmol, the degradation rate was increased drastically. Very importantly, 90.3% degradation was observed after 20 min of reaction time in presence of 4 wt% rGO loaded BiOI photocatalyst and KPS, whereas only 63% in photodegradation is obtained for BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalyst i.e., without KPS.  The possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism of BiOI-rGO photocatalyst is displayed in Fig. 10 . When BiOI-rGO photocatlyst is illuminated with visible light, the electrons that are excited from valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) and thereby creating the electron-hole pair . In the presence of rGO, the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs are effectively separated into free charge carriers. Therefore, the electrons in the CB of BiOI freely migrated to the rGO layer and react with O2 to generate superoxide radicals and preventing the electron\u2013hole recombination. Whereas, the holes left in the VB of BiOI react with water to generate large number of reactive OH radicals. These OH and superoxide radicals are the reactive species for the degradation of MO dye. To support the proposed mechanism as well as to prove the major role of OH radicals during the dye degradation process, the photodegradation was performed in the presence of OH radical scavenger. Benzoic acid is a well-known OH radical scavenger that was used in the present work . It can be seen from Fig. 11 , as the concentration of benzoic acid increases from 0.125 mmol to 1.0 mmol, the photodegradation rate decreases considerably. This clearly confirms that OH radicals are the major active species in the present photodegradation system. However, complete prevention of degradation was not observed even with high concentration of benzoic acid. This might be due to the degradation of the dye using superoxide anion radical (O2 \u2212 ) in addition to OH radicals.  Reusability is an important characteristic of any photocatalyst . The reusability of the BiOI-rGO (4 wt%) photocatalyst was tested for four consecutive cycles. Fig. 12 shows the percentage degradation of MO under photocatalytic irradiation. It was observed that the BiOI-rGO photocatalyst was recycled at least four times with little decrease (\u223c2%) in MO degradation. Thus, the present photocatalytic system may be more attractive towards large scale industrial application.  The rGO supported visible light active BiOI photocatalyst was successfully synthesized using hydrothermal method. It was found that the various wt% rGO loaded BiOI photocatalyst has shown different morphological nanostructures. The loading of rGO content with respect to BiOI enhanced the optical absorption to more visible region compared to that of bare BiOI. In comparison with BiOI, all the rGO loaded BiOI photocatalyst improved the photocatalytic performance for the decomposition of MO dye under visible light illumination. In particular, 4 wt% rGO content loaded BiOI was found to be optimized and about 3 fold enhancement in the photocatalytic activity was achieved than bare BiOI. The increased photocatalytic performance was mainly due to interfacial charge separation and transportation properties of rGO sheets. A plausible mechanism was proposed and well supported by radical trapping experiments. Very importantly, catalyst was used for four cycles without significant loss in its activity.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The manganate perovskites (in thin film or powder form) with Mn atom at B-site have shown many attractive features, especially in the giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR) which is used in the development of magnetic head device [1]. Strontium manganate (SrMnO3), one of such demanding nanostructured oxide perovskites being used as an efficient catalyst for water splitting and evolution of O2 in the presence of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 with a slight improvement of size and uniformity [2]. Large specific surface area of nanostructured hexagonal SrMnO3 helps to increase catalytic activity on a vast scale [3]. SrMnO3 nanostructures have drawn considerable attention in spintronic devices research [4]. There are numerous reports available relating to the fabrication and application of Sr and Mn-based perovskite oxide materials in the treatment of internal combustion exhaust emission [5\u20137], where the decomposition/oxidation of the perovskite precursors have been studied using thermogravimetry and evolved gas analysis. Recently, the perovskite materials have attracted considerable interest in metal-air or metal-oxygen battery, as a catalyst to accelerate the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well [8]. The ORR and OER catalytic activities of perovskite depend on surface property, electronic conductivity, morphology, specific surface area, phase structure, vacancy, and oxygen absorption [9]. Consider, for example, La1-xSrxMnO3, which exhibits excellent ORR/OER catalytic activity in alkaline solution, and it is a promising candidate to enhance the ORR electrolytic activity in fuel cells and metal-air or metal-oxygen (Li-O2 and Na-O2) batteries with superior specific capacity, cycle stability, and rate capability [10\u201314]. However, a significant problem with metal-air batteries is that the both alkaline metals (Na, Li) and the oxide-perovskites absorb moisture from the environment, which reduce the cell performance by self-discharge [15]. The moisture problems of metal-oxygen batteries can be partly avoided by tuning the surface wettability of these catalytic oxide-perovskite nanostructures. Various approaches have been adapted to make surface water-repelling, for example, chemical etching, templet deposition, spray coating, laser electrodeposition, solution immersion, etc. The wettability of a nanostructured surface can be controlled by coating some particular materials which can be tuned with a respective external stimulus, e.g., light, temperature[16], pH, electric field, magnetic field [17], mechanical strain [18], etc. Surfaces with pH-responsive wetting behaviour allow the control of liquids with high precision [19]. By shifting the femtosecond laser fluence, it was possible to control the wetting properties of a semiconductor surface through an efficient and reproducible variety of surface harshness [20]. In most of the cases, an additional water-repelling coating is used, which may sometimes affect the usual device performance. Thus it is always advantageous to turn the nanostructured surface themselves water repelling. Recently tuning wettability of surface by ion beam irradiation has attracted significant attention. Surface wetting property depends on the chemical nature of the surface as well as on the microstructures present on it. Ions can produce surface defects, which usually alters its chemical nature to some extent. Furthermore, high energy ions can change the surface topography through sputtering, diffusion, and thermal spike related effects. Therefore, the ion beam can be a great tool to alter and control surface properties. There are number studies that shed light on the importance of the ion beam technique for tuning wetting of the surface. For instance, Das et al. [21], demonstrated a competitive role of ion beam induced defects and structural modifications of carbon nanotubes for deciding the surface wetting. Furthermore, Dhal et al. [22] studied the role of ion beam induced joining of hydrogen titanate nanotubes for producing a superhydrophobic surface from an initial superhydrophilic one. In most of these previous works, the detailed insight of molecular interactions at the surface was not available. In this work, we explore the role of ion beam to turn a superhydrophilic strontium manganate nanowire surface to a water-repelling one. We look into details of molecular-level interactions using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulation to understand the in-depth picture of the ion beam modifications and resulting change of wetting properties. For low energy ions at 5\u00a0keV, the surface becomes increasingly hydrophobic to superhydrophobic with ion fluence. The underlying mechanism of interaction, however, changes at higher energies (50\u2013100\u00a0keV in this study). The nanowire network surface turns into superhydrophobic at a quite low ion fluence and does not change with increasing fluence. The state-of-the-art TRI3DYN simulation predicts a higher rate of oxygen and strontium sputtering at low energy and formation of welded network structure at higher ion energy. The density functional theory-based calculations show the nanowire surface turns into hydrophobic due to the presence of strontium and oxygen vacancy at low irradiation energy and surface to become superhydrophobic at high energies due to formation of nanowelded porous structure. The predictions have been corroborated with structural and morphological changes observed through electron microscopy studies and elemental composition change induced by low energy ions through x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  The strontium manganate (SrMnO3) nanowires have been synthesized hydrothermally. 0.5\u00a0millimol Manganese (II) Acetate Tetra-hydrate and 0.6\u00a0millimol Strontium Acetate are dissolved in deionized water to make a 30\u00a0ml solution. After that, 99.6\u00a0mg of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) has been added to the solution, stirred for a sufficiently long time to increase the rate of reaction. After that, 10\u00a0M of KOH and NaOH are slowly added to the solution until complete precipitation occurs. The final solution is kept in an autoclave for four days at a temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C. The reaction product found at the bottom of the autoclave is adequately cleaned with deionized water and ethanol, followed by drying in an oven at 90\u00a0\u00b0C. The film of SrMnO3 nanowire samples was prepared by spin-coating and drop-casting methods. Few milligrams of SrMnO3 nanowire powder dispersed in 99.9% pure 10\u00a0ml ethanol and ultrasonicated for about 30\u00a0min. The well-dispersed solution is then coated on pre-cleaned, highly conducting n-type (100 oriented) silicon substrate. The drop-casting on both silicon as well as glass substrate was done at a temperature of about 50\u00a0\u00b0C to quickly evaporate the ethanol. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "from the substrate surface and avoid clustering of the nanowires. The SrMnO3 nanowires before and after the ion irradiation have been analysed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Merlin Compact Gemini) available at IIT Bhubaneswar and 300\u00a0kV Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, Tecnai F30-ST) available at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), Kolkata. The Crystal structure of pristine and irradiated SrMnO3 have analyzed using the Panalytical Xpert Pro X-ray diffractometer at IIT Bhubaneswar. The chemical states and stoichiometry of the SrMnO3 samples have studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy setup available at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai. The irradiation was done with N+ ions at low energy (5\u00a0keV) as well as at relatively higher energies (50\u2013100\u00a0keV). For all the ion energies the irradiations have been performed for ion fluences of 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 and 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 respectively. The low energy irradiation was accomplished in the ion-implantation setup available in atomic, molecular, and surface physics lab of IIT Bhubaneswar [21]. The substrate surfaces have been kept perpendicular to the incoming beam in all the implantations. N+ ion implantations of energy 50\u2013100\u00a0keV have been achieved in the low energy ion beam facility (LEIBF) of IUAC, New Delhi.  The as-prepared nanowire-coated silicon substrate is studied under FESEM, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The individual nanowires are lying randomly parallel to the substrate surface. The average diameter of the nanowires is about 60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0nm, as seen from the histogram given in the inset. The dispersive energy spectrum (EDS) in Fig 1(b) shows the presence of Mn L\u03b1 at 0.637\u00a0keV, and Sr K\u03b11 line at 14.14\u00a0keV. The elemental mapping at the surface of the nanowires have been performed in FESEM and exhibits significant presence of strontium L\u03b1 at 1.8\u00a0keV, manganese K\u03b11 at 5.9\u00a0keV, and oxygen K\u03b11 at 0.525\u00a0keV, respectively. Detailed atomic mapping and EDS obtained from a pristine single nanowire as well as from a large-area surface obtained using FESEM are given in supplementary as Fig. S1, which confirms that approximate stoichiometry of Sr, Mn, and O is about 1:1:3. The transmission electron micrographs show well-separated nanowires having mostly straight structures. The lattice fringe analysis yields spacing of 0.38\u00a0nm, which corresponds to (0\u00a01\u00a02) plane of the perovskite. The selected area diffraction pattern (Fig. 1(c)) reveals a few other crystal planes corresponding to perovskite SrMnO3 (SMO) apart from (0\u00a01\u00a02). The crystal structure has been analysed using X-ray diffraction technique. A number of peaks appear, as seen in Fig 1(d), which confirm the formation of four-fold hexagonal (4H) perovskite SrMnO3 (JCPDS file # 00-024-1213) nanowires. For 5\u00a0keV irradiation energy and for ion fluence up to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 (Fig. 2 (a)) there are no apparent changes observed on overall structure and surface morphology of the nanowire mesh. TRIM [23] (Transport of Ions in Matter) simulation yields that 5\u00a0keV\u00a0N+ ion has a range of about 10\u00a0nm, and it deposits energy of 46\u00a0eV/\u00c5 in strontium manganate. Therefore, the collision cascades and damaging effects are limited to the surface of the nanowires and there is no deformation of the nanowires from its initial structure. The structural changes become apparent with increasing ion energy. Even at lower ion fluence of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122, for both 50 and 100\u00a0keV energy, the nanowires are randomly bent, and the onset of joining is visible (Fig. 2(c), (e)). At higher ion fluence of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 and for both the higher energies (Fig. 2(d), (f)), large-scale nano-joining is quite visible throughout the mesh [22]. TRIM simulation yields that the range of 100\u00a0keV\u00a0N+ ions is about 140\u00a0nm and deposits approximately 75\u00a0eV/\u00c5, which creates, on average, 550 number defects. Therefore, the ions and resulting collision cascades cover almost the entire width of the wire and deposit a significant part of the energy within the volume of nanowires. Hence, we observe significant deformations of the nanowires. The sputtered out atoms from the nanowires fill the intermediate gaps between the nanowires, which establish bonding by saturating dangling bonds at the defect sites [24]. Similar junction formation has been reported earlier for several other ceramic and metal nanowires by ion beam irradiation [22,24\u201326]. For metals, however, thermal spike plays a crucial role in joining process as they possess lower melting points. A typical Y-type junction of SMO nanowires formed by 50\u00a0keV\u00a0N+ ions at 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 is studied using TEM (Fig. 3 ). The micrographs confirm the formation of solid junctions between the nanowires [27]. The high magnification image, as well as selected area electron diffraction patterns, confirm a high degree of amorphization in the junction areas. The x-ray diffraction studies of irradiated samples support the TEM observations (see Fig. 4 ). For instance, at 5\u00a0keV, there is essentially no change in the crystal structure, and all the planes are present. At 50\u00a0keV and other higher ion energy irradiations, the crystal planes (1\u00a00\u00a04), (0\u00a01\u00a02), (1\u00a01\u00a00), (0\u00a02\u00a03), (1\u00a01\u00a04), (1\u00a02\u00a03) and (0\u00a02\u00a06) diminish significantly. While few other crystal planes of SMO such as (1\u00a00\u00a05), (0\u00a01\u00a00), (0\u00a01\u00a03), (0\u00a00\u00a04), (0\u00a02\u00a02), (0\u00a01\u00a04), (0\u00a01\u00a06), (1\u00a02\u00a04), (1\u00a00\u00a02) and (1\u00a03\u00a03) disappear, which signify a high degree of amorphization due to ion beam induced creation of defects. The irradiation effects are further investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (see Fig. 5 ). The strontium shows two characteristic peaks with significant intensities at approximately 132.5\u00a0eV and 134.5\u00a0eV corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of SMO and two small intensity peaks at 134 and 136\u00a0eV for binding energies of 3d states related to SrO (Fig. 5(a)). After irradiation with 5\u00a0keV\u00a0N+ ions at fluence of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 relative intensities of Sr3d doublets of SMO decrease and doublet corresponding to SrO increases, which indicates ion-induced oxygen vacancy and defect formations [28]. Looking into the electron spectrum of manganese, two oxidation states of Mn are found (Fig. 5(b)). While the peaks at about 641.3 and 652.9\u00a0eV correspond to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies of Mn3+ state, the peaks at 642 and 654\u00a0eV related to binding energies of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at Mn4+ oxidation state [29]. After irradiation, all the peaks are shifted to higher binding energies indicating the change in the chemical environment around Mn due to defects (Fig. 5(e) and (h)).. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "The oxygen 1s electron spectra carry a clear signature of irradiation effects. The pristine peak of oxygen contains contributions of oxygen at 528.6\u00a0eV corresponding to SMO, at 529.6\u00a0eV for water and hydroxyl groups, and peaks at 531.1 and 532.3\u00a0eV corresponding to oxygen vacancies (Fig. 5(c)) [30,31]. After irradiation, the relative intensities of oxygen vacancy related peaks enhances due to significant defect creations. Furthermore, the oxygen peaks of SMO and water/hydroxyl groups relatively decrease after irradiation, as seen in Fig. 5(f) and (i). At 50\u00a0keV ion energy, the XPS data shows that the binding energy of each Sr, Mn, and O increases by nearly 3.5\u00a0eV, as seen in Fig. 5(g)\u2013(i), which indicates new bond formation due to redeposition and ion beam mixing leading to joining. A state-of-the-art computer simulation, namely TRI3DYN, has been used to introspect the detailed ion beam interaction with the SMO nanowires, which is based on binary collision approximation and executed using Monte Carlo simulation concept [32]. The consequence of interactions between energetic ion beam with materials surface can be simulated using this program for any arbitrary 3D system [33]. This modeling is capable of studying the static and dynamic variables of the target system by taking into account of sputter and recoil atoms, their potential re-deposition, and atomic mixing. The program predicts defect migrations, distribution of implanted ions, relative sputtering yield, and re-deposition of sputtered out atoms among several other parameters close to realistic effects. To start with the model configuration, two cross nanowires of diameter 70\u00a0nm each, made of small volume elements (so-called the voxels) of 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0140\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0140 voxels, are placed on the silicon substrate (Fig. 6 ). Here the total computational volume involves 175(depth)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0490\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0490\u00a0nm3. Broad ion beam of 5 and 100\u00a0keV\u00a0N+ ions are used for irradiation onto the nanowire assembly. For 100\u00a0keV ions, since the range (~140\u00a0nm) is larger than the average diameter of a nanowire; therefore, most of the ions pass through. The resulting total atomic density of the nanowires after irradiation undergoes small change, and the most affected part is the surface of the nanowires. Fig. 7 shows the X-Z central slice cuts (14\u00a0nm thickness) of the computation system along the vertical axis. It is found that total atomic fraction at the surface of the nanowire system decreases continuously from 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01022\u00a0cm\u22123 to 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01022\u00a0cm\u22123 with an increase of ion fluence up to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0cm\u22122 from pristine nanowires for 100\u00a0keV incident energy, which accounts for a drop of about 35%. This drastic change of atomic fraction is the consequence of recoils, sputtering, and re-depositions of atoms. The atomic fractions in Fig. 8 predict the relative change of individual elements post-irradiation. While atomic fractions of Sr and Mn increase by about 25% in several regions in the nanowires the same for oxygen reduces by about 17% at an ion fluence of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 compared to the pristine nanowires. This indicates oxygen sputters out relatively more compared to other atoms in the system. Significant loss of oxygen due to preferential sputtering is also apparent from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement in Fig. 5. The total sputtering yields for individual elements obtained through TRI3DYN simulation are given in Table 1 , which predicts approximately an order of magnitude greater sputtering yield for oxygen compared to the other elements for both the ion energies. The component sputtering yield (Table 2 ) predicts the same trend. It emphasizes that at 5\u00a0keV ion energy, the sputtering yield of oxygen is more than that of 100\u00a0keV ion energy because of the fact that the low energy ions deposit almost entire energy to the nanowire system. It is noticeable from Figs. 7 and 8 that the sputtered out atoms are redeposited in the junction regions as well as on the adjacent surface. There is a further exchange of atoms at the interface from one nanowire to the other in the junction region due to ion beam mixing [27]. Thus the redeposited atoms and ion beam mixing play a crucial role in the formation of the welded junction [34,24]. With increasing ion beam fluence, more atoms are deposited in the junctions, and as a result, junction thickness increases, as evident from Figs. 7 and 8, as well as from electron microscopy studies. From Tables 1 and 2, it is apparent that all three types of atoms are sputtered out and may get deposited in the junction area. Hence the formation of a complex oxide in the junction area is a likely possibility. As discussed in the beginning that the perovskite materials attract water molecules, which is also evident from our measurements on pristine SMO. The pristine nanowire network is superhydrophilic, with a contact angle of about 10\u00b0 (Fig. 9 (a)). We have systematically investigated the effect of different ion energy and fluence on contact angle, respectively. At low ion energy (5\u00a0keV), the nanowire network turns gradually into hydrophobic and then to superhydrophobic. For instance, at 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0ions.cm\u22122, the contact angle (CA) is 90\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0. With a slight increase of fluence to 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0ions.cm\u22122, the CA becomes 115\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0. With increasing ion fluence, the CA systematically increases, and the network becomes superhydrophobic with CA 152\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0 at ion fluence of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 (Fig. 9(e)). It can be noticed that till 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 CA increases rapidly, followed by a slow increase at higher fluences (Fig. 9(f)). At this low energy, there are hardly any changes in the structure and morphology of the nano-network, as evident from electron micrographs. Hence, there is no role of structure or roughness of the surface at low energy. In order to understand the underlying role of change of surface chemical composition due to ion irradiation, we have used density functional theory based calculations. It is apparent that at this low ion energy, the surface of each nanowire suffers a significant loss of oxygen due to sputtering. The role of oxygen vacancy is looked upon in the calculation. The Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos ultra-soft (RRKJUS) pseudopotentials are used with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional, van der Waals interactions throughout the calculation [35]. The plane wave cut-off energy was set at 25\u00a0Ry and the density. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "cut-off at 225\u00a0Ry, while the convergence threshold for self-consistency was set at 10\u22126. The lattice vectors of the supercells in the XY plane are chosen in such a way to have a relaxed SMO crystal. The third supercell parameter, in the z-direction, is the same in all cases (20\u00a0\u00c5), chosen large enough to decouple the periodic copies (Fig. 10 (a)). To study the irradiation effect in SrMnO3 nanostructure, one oxygen is removed from the surface, as shown in Fig. 10(b). Four possible configurations of a water molecule on 4H SMO crystal have been considered in the calculation having water molecule placed along c-axis of the crystal with O-side down (Fig. 11 (a)), water molecule placed along c-axis of the crystal with H-side down (Fig. 11(b)), water molecule placed along a-axis of the crystal with O-side down (Fig. 11(c)), and water molecule placed along a-axis of the crystal with H-side down (Fig. 11(d)), respectively. The calculations were performed using the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE, version 6.2) [36,37]. To investigate the stability of the water molecules on SMO nanowires, the binding energy (Eb) is defined as Eb=E(nanowire+water)--E(nanowire)--E(water) where E(nanowire+water), E(nanowire), and E(water) are the total energy of the system of water adsorbed on the nanowire, the corresponding nanowire, and water, respectively. Binding energies of different geometries are listed in Table 3 , by analysing the interaction of the H2O molecule on the four different configurations (Fig. 11). Water molecules are released from a distance, which is beyond the bound state barrier and allow the whole structure to relax so that a stable minimum energy is achieved. It was found that the binding of H2O with SMO (\u22122.003\u00a0eV) is energetically favourable. However, in the presence of oxygen vacancy, the average binding energy is +0.36\u00a0eV, which does not bound the water molecule to the surface. Therefore, pristine SMO attracts water, and irradiated SMO surface repels water molecules. The XPS analysis also supports this fact that with increasing oxygen vacancy, OH containing groups decrease on the surface (Fig. 5). In order to understand the effect of a whole water droplet in this interaction process, we have considered three layers of water molecules, which take into account the effects of interactions between water molecules themselves on controlling the wetting nature of the SMO surface. Three layers of H2O molecules are placed on the pristine surface of SMO crystal at a distance of 2\u00a0\u00c5 (Fig. 12 ). The same procedure has been repeated by placing all the three layers on relaxed oxygen and strontium vacant SMO surface at 2\u00a0\u00c5 distance, and all the structure were relaxed with a 10\u22126\u00a0Ry convergence threshold for self-consistency. In the case of the pristine SMO surface, all H2O layers move toward the surface, and O atom of H2O forms bond with Sr. Hence, the water molecule shows chemisorption on the unmodified surface and surface becomes superhydrophilic. However, the water molecule doesn't interact with the O-vacant SMO surface, and the bottom water layer stayed at the same distance (i.e., 2\u00a0\u00c5), where it was initially placed above the surface, and this negates the hydrophilic nature of the surface. For the Sr-vacant surface, O atom of SMO surface repeal O atom of the water molecule and whole water layers move away from the SMO, which results in the underlying hydrophobic nature of the surface. The TRI3DYN simulation results predict that the most significant component sputtering yield is for oxygen, followed by strontium at 5\u00a0keV ion energy. Hence ion-induced oxygen and strontium vacancies contribute significantly toward the hydrophobic nature of the surface at low energy. At higher ion energies (such as 50, 80, and 100\u00a0keV), the wetting nature of SMO is quite different from that of low energy ions. At high energies, the nano network turns close to superhydrophobic even at low fluence. For instance, at 100\u00a0keV ion energy, the CA becomes 137\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0, and it increases slowly but steadily with the ion fluence and reaches 152\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0 at ion fluence of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122 (Figs. 13 and 14 ). From electron microscopy studies (Fig. 2(c)\u2013(f)), we observe that the nanowires are welded at high energies, while the joining onsets even at low fluences and a large-scale joining is observed at about 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0ions.cm\u22122. The joining creates pores, which may trap air (shown in Fig. 13(c) and (d)). As a result, the water droplet may form a Wenzel or Cassie state with the network surface. Thus air-pockets/network pores play a dominating role for hydrophobic characters of the nanowire network at low fluences for all the high energy ions. With increasing ion fluence (for high energy ions) large number of joining occurs, which makes the surface superhydrophobic. It may be noted that preferential sputtering yields of oxygen and strontium are less for high energy ions. Therefore, these vacancies play a less important role in determining wetting nature. The variations in contact angle (CA) correspoding to different ion beam energies and fluences are analysed, as shown in Fig. 14. For the low energy irradiation of 5\u00a0keV\u00a0N+ at fluences of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0cm\u22122, 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0cm\u22122, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0cm\u22122, 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0cm\u22122, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0cm\u22122, the CA of SMO nanowire surface are found to be increasing significantly and continuously. It becomes superhydrophobic at a fluence of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0cm\u22122 and above. The nature of the curves are slightly different after enhancing the ion energy from 5\u00a0keV to 50\u00a0keV, 80\u00a0keV, and 100\u00a0keV at different ions fluences varying from 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0cm\u22122 to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016\u00a0cm\u22122. Strong hydrophobic character appears even at lower fluences (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0cm\u22122), and the contact angle increases only slightly with increasing ion fluence further, as noticeable in Fig. 14. For low energy ions, the CA increases with increasing fluence. Since at low energy (5\u00a0keV), the CA depends on surface defects as obtained from simulations, hence with increasing ion fluence, the number of surface defects increases, which results in a continuous increase of CA. For higher energies (50\u00a0keV and above), joining of the nanowires creates a porous network, which is responsible for large CA. The onset of joining occurs at 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0cm\u22122, which makes the surface singnificantly hydrophobic. Once the network formation starts with the welding of nanowires, the air-pockets are created.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "These air pockets start to repel the water droplets. However, junctions are not thick enough, so air-pockets are large in size, and hence the droplets partly enter the surface, making it only hydrophobic. With increasing ion fluence for high energy ions, the junction thickness increases, and the pore size decreases, which turns the surface to a Cassie state and thereby it becomes superhydrophobic (Fig. 13). Since the pore/air-pocket size does not change much with further increase of ion fluence, hence the CA increases slowly at higher fluences. The time evolution of spherical water droplets on the thin film of SMO nanostructure (both on the pristine and irradiated surface) at various ion energy and fluences is given in the supplementary document as Fig. S2. Here contact angle (CA), droplet height (h), contact radius (r) of the water droplet while interacting with the hydrophilic (pristine), and the hydrophobic (irradiated) surface are shown in Fig. S2(a)\u2013(c), respectively for different ion energies and fluences. It is found that in case of superhydrophilic pristine sample contact radius, and droplet height drastically changes within a fraction of second. However, these two parameters (h and r) remain almost stable for a long time for hydrophobic irradiated nanowires, which indicate there is no further adsorption of water into the irradiated surface, unlike the pristine nanowires, and droplets go through the normal evaporation process. In order to verify the role of nanowire geometry on wetting property of pristine sample, we have grown bulk film of SMO. The plan view scanning electron micrograph of the pristine bulk film is shown in Fig. S3 (supplementary document). This surface is different from the nanowire film surface and having a roughness of the order of 30\u00a0nm. This pristine bulk film still shows an initial CA less than 20\u00b0, which is superhydrophilic. Upon 5\u00a0keV\u00a0N+ ion irradiation, the surface becomes hydrophobic without any change of surface topography and driven by ion-induced surface defects. Thus nanowire geometry does not play a dominant role in determining surface wettability for pristine as well as irradiation with low energy ions in the current study.  In this work, we have investigated in detail the ion beam modifications of the SrMnO3 perovskite nanowire network and the interaction of water droplet with this network. At low ion energy, there is no apparent change of structure and morphology of individual nanowires and the nanonetwork. However, our study shows significant sputtering of oxygen followed by strontium at low energy, which further increases with ion fluence. At higher energies, the nanowires are bent, and junction formation kicks off even at low ion fluences. At these energies, with increasing ion fluence, a large-scale joining is observed and forms a nanowelded network. The ion beam modification leads to two competitive factors, which determine surface wettability at different ion energies. For instance, at low energy, both oxygen and strontium vacancies play crucial roles in making the surface superhydrophobic from an initial superhydrophilic state. At high energy irradiation, the porous structure forms even at low ion fluences, which plays a dominating role and supersedes the complementary role of defects. Hence, the surface tends to become hydrophobic from quite a low fluence. Thus ion beam can be used as an effective tool to protect strontium manganate nanowires from moisture, and this technique can be adopted for other oxide-perovskites as well. Furthermore, halide-perovskites are considered to be the next generation potential solar cell materials; however, they are too sensitive to moisture degradation. Our study paves the way to solve this problem, and ion beam irradiation can be explored for these halide-perovskites to immune themselves against moisture.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Such interfacial layers are important in the collection of charge carriers and significantly affect efficiency of trap state formation at interfaces . Recently, air-stable ZnO has been shown to be a promising candidate material for electron-selective, hole-blocking layers in organic photovoltaic devices due to its large electron mobility and optical transmittance . For example, ZnO forms the electron transport layer (ETL) in an inverted OSC based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), since the conduction band edge of ZnO (\u22124.4 eV) is located between the conduction band edge of indium tin oxide (ITO) (\u22124.7 eV) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PCBM (\u22123.7 eV) . In addition, the ZnO layer can form an Ohmic contact with P3HT:PCBM in the inverted structure, and the work function can be tuned by incorporating an aliphatic-amine polymer . Several methods have been employed to fabricate ZnO thin films, including sol\u2013gel processes, which are simple, low-cost and controllable, enabling preferential c-axis orientation . Recent developments in nanofabrication have enabled the fabrication of ZnO nanostructures including nanowires, wrinkles and nanorods, and these geometries can significantly enhance various aspects of OSC performance, including photoconversion efficiency (PCE) . The photosensitive ZnO sol\u2013gel process can easily be combined with ultraviolet (UV) nanoimprint lithography, which has attracted much recent attention as a simple and high-resolution method for fabricating ZnO nanostructures . However, ZnO films produced via the sol\u2013gel process require optimization of electrical and structural properties to reduce the high density of trap states and potential barriers at that occur at grain boundaries . Here, we investigate the use of ZnO prepared via a photochemical reaction using photosensitive 2-nitrobenzaldehyde as ETLs of inverted P3HT:PCBM OSCs. The annealing temperature was systematically varied, and the structural, morphological and electrical properties of the ZnO layer were investigated to identify the relations between the growth conditions, OSC morphology, and optoelectronic characteristics.  ZnO thin films were prepared by the photosensitive sol\u2013gel process and deposited onto glass and ITO substrates by spin coating techniques. Zinc acetate dihydrate (ZAD, Zn(CH3COO)2\u00b72H2O 98%, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used as the main precursor, with 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME, CH3O(CH2)2\u00b7OH, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) as the solvent. To prepare the photosensitive sol, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, and photosensitive 2-nitrobenzaldehyde (2NB, C7H5NO3, Sigma-Aldrich) was added as a photoinitiator in order to form a cross-linked network structure via photochemical reaction. Then monoethanolamine (MEA, (HOCH2CH2)NH2, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the stabilizer. The solution has a molar ratio of Zn2+:2-ME:2NB:MEA = 1:1:37.5:1. This photosensitive precursor solution was spin coated onto the Si substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s, and baked on a hot plate at 75 \u00b0C for 1 min to remove residual solvent. The film was then exposed to UV light (52 mW/cm2 with a major wavelength peak of 365 nm) for 20 min to induce the photochemical reaction. During the UV exposure, a photo dissociation reaction occurs, which alters the protonation of the 2-nitrobenzaldenhyde . The aci-form of nitrobenzaldehyde is produced via intramolecular proton transfer, and a proton is released to yield the nitronate anion . The nitronate is then converted to a 2-nitrosobenzoic anion, and the metal ion in metal alkoxides formed by condensation attracts the nitryl ligand, forming a cross-linked structure . Following UV illumination, subsequent annealing was performed to crystallize them and electrical and structural properties were investigated as a function of annealing temperature, which was varied from 200 to 500 \u00b0C. The inverted OSCs were formed of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag, where the Ag layer formed the anode. A P3HT: PCBM blended solution (l.0:1.0 by mass) was spin-coated on the ZnO surface and dried at room temperature in a glove box for 2\u20133 h to form the active layer, followed by spin coating with PEDOT:PSS solution and baking at 150 \u00b0C for 5 min to form a 40 nm-thick hole transport layer. A 100-nm-thick silver (Ag) electrode layer was then deposited by thermal evaporation. The chemical properties of the precursor and UV-irradiated films were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo VG Scientific, K-alpha). Surface morphology was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (PSIA, XE-100) operated in non-contact mode, as well as field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, S-4800). Crystallinity was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker, D8 Discover). Sheet resistance was measured using a four-point probe (AIT) (CMT-SR1000N). Solar cells performance was measured using an air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (Oriel 500 W) at 100 mW/cm2. Current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter.  Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of ZnO thin films as a function of annealing temperature, which reveals that the as-deposited ZnO films were polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure, and crystallized at annealing temperatures in excess of 200 \u00b0C, with a preferred orientation of (0 0 2). As the temperature increased, ZnO crystallites grew along the (0 0 2) plane, as this has the highest atomic packing density and lowest surface energy. To investigate the effect of annealing temperature on the degree of orientation of the (0 0 2) plane, the texture coefficient T c(h k l) was calculated, as defined by Barret and Massalski : i.e., Tc(hkl)=I(hkl)/I0(hkl)(1/n)\u2211I(hkl)/I0(hkl) where I(h k l) is the set of XRD intensities of corresponding planes (h k l) obtained from the measurement data, I o(h h k l) is the set of intensities in the reference data (JCPDS 36-14561), and n is the number of diffraction planes . The texture coefficient of the (0 0 2) plane is 1.84 for the samples annealed at 500 \u00b0C, which implies an abundance of grains in the [0 0 2] direction. As shown in Fig. 1, the degree of orientation of the (0 0 2) plane increased as the annealing temperature increased. Fig. 2a shows the XPS spectra with respect to the annealing temperature. Peaks corresponding to elements other than Zn, O and C. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "were not detected. The peaks for C are attributed to hydrocarbon contamination on the surface due to the ambient atmosphere. Fig. 2b demonstrates the high resolution XPS spectra of the Zn 2p3/2 region. The binding energy was carefully calibrated using the adventitious carbon peak (C 1s) at 285 eV in order to avoid the sample charging effect . Note that the binding energy of Zn 2p3/2 of the sample annealed at 350 \u00b0C was 1022.9 eV, which is smaller than that for the sample annealed at 300 \u00b0C (i.e., 1023.2 eV). This shift in binding energy of the core-level ZnO states at the surface is associated with a change in atomic packing density, which is related to the texture coefficient, which exhibited a similar variation with respect to the annealing temperature (see Fig. 1). Surface morphology is a particularly important parameter of the ETL layer, which is related not only to electron transport properties, but also to light trapping in OSCs. Fig. 3 shows AFM images of the surface morphology of samples annealed at various different temperatures. Both the surface roughness and grain size increased as the annealing temperature increased. In Fig. 4 , we summarized the evolution of the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness and grain size as a function of the annealing temperature. Compared to the XPS measurements which show the abrupt binding energy shift above 350 \u00b0C, we also see a marked increase in the roughness and grain size above 350 \u00b0C from the AFM data. To investigate the electrical properties of ZnO thin films, we measured the sheet resistance using a four point probe method. As shown in Fig. 5 , the sheet resistance exhibited an abrupt decrease as the annealing temperature increased beyond 350 \u00b0C. The sheet resistance decreased from 0.6 \u00d7 103 to 0.04 \u00d7 103\u03a9/\u25a1 as increasing the annealing temperature from 350 to 450 \u00b0C. This decrease in sheet resistance can be explained by the increase in the crystallinity and grain size with increasing temperature (see Figs. 1 and 4). In general, the electron mobility in a lightly doped ZnO is mainly limited by scattering at grain boundaries . Furthermore, electron mobility is related to the ZnO film crystallinity. Therefore, the decrease in sheet resistance may be attributed to the increase in grain size and enhanced crystallinity. The decrease in sheet resistance of the ZnO layer should lead to improved electron and hole extraction from the device. As shown in Fig. 5b, a similar trend was also observed for the thicker ZnO film, which was prepared via five repeated spin coating steps. The inset of Fig. 5 shows cross-sectional SEM images of the ZnO thin film, which clearly indicate that the ZnO surface was macroscopically smooth and free from cracks. To verify the effect of the ZnO layer, we fabricated inverted P3HT:PCBM OSCs with ETLs formed of 200-nm-thick ZnO thin films that were annealed at varying temperature. Fig. 6 shows the J\u2013V characteristics of the resulting solar cells, with device structure shown schematically in the inset. The devices did not function when ZnO layers were annealed at temperatures below 300 \u00b0C, suggesting that the photoinitiator and stabilizer and ZnO precursors were removed at temperatures above 300 \u00b0C. As the temperature increased to 330 \u00b0C, the PCE increased significantly. The device formed using the ZnO thin film annealed at 330 \u00b0C exhibited a short-circuit current density of J sc = 9.39 mA/cm2 and a PCE of 2.31%, as well as an open circuit voltage of V oc = 0.60 V and a fill factor of FF = 41.0%. However, a further increase in annealing temperature degraded device performance, though electrical properties improved. Table 1 lists the extracted device performance parameters. The efficiency of the cell did not improve as the temperature increased above 330 \u00b0C because of the decrease in short-circuit current density (which decreased from 9.39 to 7.64 mA/cm2 as temperature increased from 330 to 350 \u00b0C). This decrease in J sc can be attributed to the increase in surface roughness with increasing annealing temperature, which would increase leakage current and contact resistance . To further investigate the significance of the ZnO layer, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured for devices annealed at varying temperature, as shown in Fig. 7 . The device annealed at 330 \u00b0C exhibited a larger EQE than the other devices over the entire spectral range, suggesting that the improvement in efficiency of OSCs formed using ZnO layers annealed at 330 \u00b0C resulted from improved electron transport properties of the ZnO ETL.  In this study, we have investigated the morphological and electrical properties of the ZnO thin films prepared via a photochemical reaction to form the ETL of inverted P3HT:PCBM OSCs. A marked increase in grain size and surface roughness was observed as the annealing temperature increased beyond 350 \u00b0C, accompanied by a decrease in sheet resistance. The PCE increased as a function of temperature for temperatures below 350 \u00b0C; however, further increases in annealing temperature degraded device performance, despite improved electrical properties. OSCs formed with ZnO thin film annealed at 330 \u00b0C exhibited a J sc of 9.39 mA/cm2, a PCE of 2.31%, a V oc of 0.60 V and a FF of 41.0%.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Initially, the incorporation of Na from the soda-lime glass substrate has been considered of vital importance [1,2]: increased p-type conductivity of the CIGS absorbers [3,4], grain boundary passivation [3,5]. Besides Na, the influences of potassium (K) incorporation into the CIGS absorber have also been widely investigated. The incorporation of K into CIGS was first reported by Contreras et al. [6]. The concept was successfully further developed by Swiss Federal Laboratories of Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) using a potassium fluoride post-deposition treatment (KF-PDT). In 2013, the fabricated solar cells on flexible substrates reached 20.4% efficiency, which was considered as a milestone in accelerating the development of CIGS thin-film solar cells [7]. Following from that, heavier alkaline metals such as Rb and Cs were broadly studied by many research groups. In 2016, the German research centre ZSW in Stuttgart announced a champion CIGS solar cell with 22.6% efficiency using RbF-PDT treatment [8]. In November 2018, the Japanese company, Solar Frontier, reported a 23.35% efficient CIGS solar cell, independently certified by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) with a novel caesium fluoride (CsF) surface treatment [9]. RbF and CsF treatments are still under investigations and have resulted in many publications [11,33]. Alkaline incorporation into CIGS films is mainly implemented through three schemes categorized by the deposition sequence: pre-deposition, co\u2013evaporation or post-deposition. Taking Na as an example, pre-deposition means that the Na supply source is present prior to the formation of the CIGS absorber. Commonly used approaches include: 1) Soda-lime glass (SLG) as substrate; 2) NaF precursor layer deposition on top of the Mo back contact [11]; 3) Modified sodium doped Mo (Mo:Na) back electrodes. Salom\u00e9 et al. compared all these Na doping techniques and concluded that preparing CIGS solar cells directly on SLG substrates is more effective compared to the other two methods [12]. Co-evaporation enables the simultaneous incorporation of Na into CIGS during grain growth [13]. For example, alkaline compounds can be deposited during the multi-stage co-evaporation process of CIGS absorbers. Post-evaporation refers to the method where Na diffusion takes place after the CIGS absorber formation, and hence is referred to as \u201cpost-deposition treatment (PDT)\u201d. Table 1 summarizes the important findings of potassium fluoride PDT (KF-PDT) techniques from the literature. A more complete review can be found in ref [14]. Among all the doping techniques, CIGS solar cells with SLG as substrate and alkaline PDT demonstrate superior performances. More Importantly, the PDT technology enhances the CIGS solar cell efficiencies with both CdS and Zn(O,S,OH)-based buffer layers [15\u201317]. It is necessary to mention that the optimized PDT process is dependent on the CIGS surface conditions, including morphology and roughness, chemical compositions and crystallinities. Therefore, developing a PDT process that is suitable for the CIGS absorbers fabricated in this work with a two-stage sequential process using thermally evaporated Se is necessary. What is more, as can be seen in Table 1, the effects potassium on the morphology, and chemical composition of CIGS absorbers are still under debate. In this contribution, the CIGS absorbers were subject to potassium KF-PDT process with specific focus on deposition temperature, post-annealing conditions and thickness of KF layer. Simultaneously, the fabricated CIGS solar cells were analysed with double diode equivalent circuit model, and thermal admittance spectroscopy.  The CIGS absorbers investigated were prepared by a two-stage sequential process, including metal precursor sputtering and a rapid thermal annealing under selenium contained atmosphere. Detailed fabrication process can be found in the supplementary material (Fig. S1). The KF-PDT was performed with two methods: (i) evaporation at room temperature, followed by high temperature annealing at 350\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of selenium vapour (post-annealing); (ii) evaporation at elevated substrate temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C without any post-annealing process. For nomenclature, samples with room temperature and 200\u00a0\u00b0C deposited KF are denoted as \u201cR.T._KF\u201d and \u201c200\u00b0C_KF\u201d, respectively. The morphology of CIGS films were characterized by surface and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (model AURIGA-39\u201335). Surface chemical compositions were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which was conducted with an Omicron EA125 U7 hemispherical electron spectrometer with 7-channel detection. All spectra were recorded at constant pass energy of 20\u00a0eV. The X-ray gun was an Omicron Twin Anode Al K\u03b1 source with an input power of 300\u00a0W (15\u00a0kV\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0mA). The equipment was calibrated using a reference Ag sample to confirm that the Ag 3d5/2 line appears at a binding energy of 368.2\u00a0eV. The illuminated J-V curves were recorded using LED solar simulators providing spectrum tunability across 300\u20131100\u00a0nm and intensity variations from 1.2 Suns down to 0.1 Suns (model: WAVELABS, SINUS-220). Both the measured dark and illuminated J-V characteristics were simulated with double-diode circuit model. For capacitance\u2013voltage (C-V) profiling, the capacitance was measured with a capacitance meter (Boonton 7200) and a digital capacitance offset box. The bias voltages changed from \u20131 V to 0.5\u00a0V, with programmable oscillating voltages of 15, 30, 50 and 100\u00a0mV. The C-V measurement is based on the parallel equivalent-circuit model that is intrinsically chosen by the equipment. Thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) measurements were performed with impedance analyser from a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation. The magnitude and phase of the impedance were recorded for each temperature and frequency. The frequencies of the applied small AC signal changed from 100\u00a0Hz to 1\u00a0MHz, which was superimposed on a constant DC bias voltage. The sample temperatures varied between 200 and 300\u00a0K, as facilitated by the liquid N2 cooling. Due to the sensitivity of CIGS solar cells to the external illumination and applied bias, the solar cells were stored in dark for several hours to reach the relaxed state before measurement. Additionally, temperature-dependent Voc was recorded within the temperature range of 200 to 300\u00a0K.  Fig. 1 shows surface SEM images of as-deposited, KF-PDT treated and post-annealed CIGS absorbers. The KF thickness varied from 3\u00a0nm to 15\u00a0nm. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the deposited KF appears as white dot-like particles which are distributed uniformly on the CIGS surface [20]. After post annealing, these particles soften and diffuse into the CIGS surface, forming small islands on the CIGS grain with identical shape. In the case of a thicker KF surface layer (Fig. 1(c)), the small particles tend to accumulate as much larger precipitates and the CIGS surface becomes very rugged. Furthermore, a large amount of these precipitates stay at the CIGS grain boundaries, as circled in Fig. 1(c). After post-annealing, these big precipitates distribute uniformly on the surface of grains and across the grain boundaries. Similar phenomena have also been observed for samples with 200\u00b0C_KF (Fig. 1(f)). However, the density of the deposited K-related precipitates seems to be lower than R.T._KF method despite of larger thickness of KF. It is also notable that the as-deposited CIGS absorber without any PDT also exhibits some small white pigment like particles at the surface, which can be attributed to sodium selenide (Na2Sex or NaSeO3) [30] . However, with KF-PDT these particles become less recognizable, indicating the ion-exchange effects between K and Na [7]. From surface SEM measurements, we don\u2019t observe any reductions of the CIGS grain size, as reported by Wuerz et al. [21]. Fig. 2 shows SEM images of KF treated CIGS absorbers before and after surface cleaning process with an ammonia-CdSO4 mixture. It is clear that the KF remnants were removed from the CIGS surface by ammonia solution. These results disagree with previous works which showed that some remnants from KF-PDT can only be removed by HCl due to the formation of KInSe2 [24], which will be disucussed further in session 3.2. Fig. 3 (a)\u2013(e) show surface SEM images of CIGS absorbers with various post-treatment conditions after CdS deposition. Fig. 4 (a) (b) show the cross-section views of as-deposited CIGS absorbers, and KF-PDT treated ones as well. As can be seen in these figures, the surface morphologies of CIGS/CdS films don\u2019t change significantly compared to as-deposited CIGS absorbers. There are neither discernible indications of improved uniformity of the CdS film nor reduced surface roughness. However, the MoSe2 layer is more pronounced for KF-PDT treated CIGS absorbers from the cross-sectional view, as already reported by Wuerz et al. [19]. In order to understand the effect of KF-PDT on the CdS buffer layer deposition and hetero-junction formation, XPS studies were carried out. Subsequently after surface morphology observations, five CIGS samples, were prepared for XPS studies and the quantitative analysis are listed in Table 2 . One sample (S2) was prepared by dipping the KF treated absorbers (S1) directly into an ammonia-CdSO4 solution at room temperature. The thickness of the evaporated KF varied from 0.3\u00a0nm to 15\u00a0nm. The atomic concentrations of the investigated elements derived from the XPS survey scan (Fig. S2) are summarized in Table 3 . Fig. 5 shows XPS narrow scans of the Cu, In, Se, Na, K and Cd emission peaks of the samples under investigation. As can be seen from Table 3 and Fig. 5(e), the K atomic concentration is consistently increased with the thickness of KF layer, indicating successful deposition of KF layer onto the CIGS surface, and most of KF is clearly etched off by ammonia-CdSO4 solution. From Fig. 5(a), the intensity of the Cu 2p3/2 peak is very high for as-deposited CIGS absorbers (7.73 at.%); however, with KF-PDT, the intensity of the Cu emission drops slightly (~6 at.%). This suggests Cu depletion induced by K, which has been reported in previous studies for co-evaporated CIGS absorbers [7,23]. More importantly, the surface Cu content reduces significantly after ammonia-CdSO4 treatment, which cannot be attributed to Cd incorporation. Therefore, it is proposed that the incorporated K contribute to the increased amount of Cu vacancies (VCu) and Cu interstitials (Cui). Furthermore, these VCu give rise to higher possibilities of Cd doping to form CdCu antisites (as can be clearly seen in Fig. 5(f). Due to the larger ionic radius of Cd atoms, Cui are driven further away from the CIGS surface. From XRF measurement, the CGI ratio of as-deposited CIGS absorber is around 0.93. Based on recent RbF-PDT studies on co-evaporated CIGS solar cells, a higher CGI (close to unity) content is preferable towards FF and Voc improvement, highlighting the importance of mitigating shunting paths due to increased crystallinity by increasing Cu content [32,33]. Consistent with their findings, we verify that KF-PDT is highly effective surface treatment techniques for CIGS absorbers fabricated by two-stage process prepared in this work. Similar intensity reduction is also observed for the Na1s peaks, which supports the observation from the SEM measurements that K replace Na atoms during the KF\u2013PDT. Furthermore, the removal of Na is more drastic with increasing KF thickness. After ammonia-CdSO4 treatment, the Na peak is almost unrecognizable. The removal of Na by an ammonia-CdSO4 solution from the as-deposited CIGS surface has been reported [34]. Compared to that finding, it can be inferred that some Na is driven to the CIGS surface through an ion exchange mechanism by K. After ammnia-CdSO4 treatment, most Na species dissolve into the ammonia aqueous solution. The peak position for In 3d doublets for as-deposited CIGS absorbers (S5) and KF treated ones (S1) don\u2019t exhibit significant changes from fitting procedure. From this point of view, it is not possible to conclude that K atoms occupy VCu, forming KInSe2 or KCu antisites. A slight chemical shift can be observed for samples after ammonia CdSO4 treatment. This is due to substitution of Cu by Cd, affecting the chemical environment of the In atoms. The Se 3d peaks can be observed for all samples. The Se 3d doublets are too close to be distinguished within the equipment measurement resolution. As indicated in Fig. 5(d), the SeO2 peak (59\u00a0eV) and the Na2S peak (63.35\u00a0eV) can be found in as-deposited CIGS absorbers. This indicates that the Na is bonded to Se, in the form of Na2SeO3, which can be attributed to surface oxidation due to atmospheric exposure [18]. However, this peak disappears with KF\u2013PDT. Therefore,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "this finding again confirms that K replaces Na during the KF-PDT. With increased deposition temperature (200\u00b0C_KF PDT), this effect is less obvious, since the amount of K is too small. With ammonia-CdSO4 surface cleaning the surface oxides are all found to be removed. The K doublets K 2p1/2 and K 2p3/2 are clearly found in S1 and S4. However, in the narrow scan, they are not present for S3 since the concentration is too low to be detected. After ammonia-CdSO4 rinsing, the K emission is not detectable anymore. This finding is in contradiction with previous studies, showing that K can only be partially removed by ammonia, due to formation of such as KInSe2 [24]. Therefore, in our experiment, K is not found to be bonded to other elements such as In or Se. Nevertheless, the K-induced Cu depletion is observed for all KF-PDT methods. Thus, it can be deduced that VCu is highly possible to be released from occupied K during KF-PDT, which facilitates in Cd incorporation during buffer layer deposition and improve the hetero-junction formation. Thus, we interpret the result as: the primary role of KF is to prevent the formation of InCu donors instead of promoting the formation of the KCu or KInSe2 compound. In a way, KF-PDT is able to increase the acceptor concentration by reducing donor-like deep level defects (InCu). The following experiments focus mainly on the influences of post-annealing and KF deposition temperature on the electrical properties of CIGS solar cells. The thickness of the KF layer is the same for all samples. Fig. 6 displays a box chart of the 1-Sun J-V parameters of the CIGS solar cells prepared in this study. The 1-Sun J-V characteristics of some selected CIGS solar cells from each category are shown in Fig. 7 (b). From dark J-V diode analyses, the significant electrical parameters are derived and listed in Table 4 . These electrical parameters include open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), series resistance (Rs), shunt resistance (Rsh), ideality factor (n) and reverse saturation current density (Jo). In addition, the Nyquist plot from impedance measurement on CIGS solar cells with/without post-annealing process is demonstrated in Fig. 7(a). Fig. 7(b) provides a direct visualization of the effects of post-annealing. It can be seen that KF-PDT improves both Voc and Jsc while post-annealing decreases the Voc and FF significantly. From Table 4, the improved Voc by KF-PDT can be attributed to improved diode qualities, manifested by lower ideality factor and Jo. On the contrary, the degradation of Voc and FF during the post-annealing process is caused by increased total recombination and Rs. Post-annealing process derives the K further deeper into the CIGS bulk, which greatly affects the crystallinity and grain boundary defects. From another point of view, the enhanced oxidation of the surface during air annealing, might lead to reduced surface type-inversion at the CIGS surface, increasing surface recombination [35]. The increased oxygen content can also be observed from the XPS measurement (Table 3). From Fig. 6, it is also found that FF is decreased by the KF-PDT, which can be attributed to increased Rs and degraded Rsh, as can be seen from Table 4. There are two possible explanations: (1) the formation of additional vertical shunt paths such as crevices and voids along the CIGS grain boundaries (see Fig. 4); (2) the increased thickness of the MoSe2 layer between the Mo back contact and the CIGS layer (see Fig. 4(b)). Therefore, further optimization of crystallization process during post-annealing process and better control of the MoSe2 formation are necessary. The best solar cell efficiency was achieved by a 200\u00b0C_KF treatment without post-annealing. Comparable efficiency could also be reached by R.T._KF without post-annealing. Therefore, the deposition temperature of the KF layer have no significant impacts on the overall device performances of CIGS solar cells without post-annealing process. Another important observation from impedance analysis shown in Fig. 7(a) is that, compared to as-deposited CIGS solar cells, The parallel resistance (Rp) is reduced significantly by the KF-PDT than by the post-annealing process, indicating increased bulk recombination. Variations of Rp from Nyquis plot in Fig. 7(a) are the same for Rsh evaluated from diode models (Table 4). A more detailed discussion of evaluating Rp and Rsh in terms of electrical properties of solar cells is provided in supplementary material. Above all, the post-annealing process exhibit negative influences on the electrical properties of CIGS solar cells. To investigate the influences of KF-PDT on the free carrier concentration of CIGS absorbers, capacitance \u2013voltage (C-V) measurements were performed at room temperature in the dark. Fig. 8 (a) shows the calculated carrier concentration of CIGS solar cells with various KF\u2013PDT methods. As can be seen, the as-deposited CIGS absorbers exhibit a charge density of around 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01018 cm\u22123. With either R.T. or 200\u00a0\u00b0C KF-PDT, the doping concentration is increased (to ~4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01018 cm\u22123). Such high concentration compared to the state-of-the-art high-efficiency CIGS absorbers can be attributed to large amounts of defects within the CIGS bulk. However, with a post-annealing process, the charge density is reduced (to ~3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01017 cm\u22123). It is highly possible that CIGS absorber after KF-PDT contains high density of defects. The physical origin of the bulk defects may be related with K diffusion into the CIGS along grain boundaries, which is related with composition profile of the CIGS [32]. The effects of KF-PDT on the electrical properties CIGS bulk will be further discussed later on. Fig. 8(b) shows the Voc-T measurements. As indicated in this graph, CIGS solar cells with KF-PDT bring up the activation energy level closer to the bandgap values, indicating suppressed interface recombination. Also, this result is consistent with C-V profiling. Therefore, From the C\u2013V and Voc-T measurements, it can be concluded that the temperature of the KF-PDT greatly affects the defect properties and recombination mechanisms of the CIGS solar cells. As highlighted previously, the FF of CIGS solar cells with KF-PDT and post-annealing process is reduced compared to the as-deposited case. To understand this behaviour, the FF loss analysis method. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "which includes the Suns-Voc measurement and a double-diode equivalent circuit analysis was applied [37]. The raw data of Suns-Voc measurements and the equivalent circuit modelling are provided in supplementary material (Fig. S3). The quantified FF losses are listed in Table 5 . The FF loss analysis (Table 5) indicates that Rs causes the largest FF losses for all investigated CIGS solar cells. From supplementary material (Table 1), it is also observed that the post-annealing process tremendously increases the recombination current and Rs, leading to significant FF losses (Fig. 6(c)). Whereas substrate heating during KF-PDT has little influence on the diode parameters of the solar cells. This finding implies that the post-annealing process deteriorates both the junction quality and the electrical properties of CIGS solar cells. To determine the activation energy level (EA) of the solar cells, thermal admittance spectroscopy, which records the junction capacitance variations against temperature and frequency, was measured on CIGS solar cells with various KF\u2013PDT techniques. The real and imaginary part of the solar cell impedance versus the applied frequency are displayed in supplementary material (Fig. S4). The measurements were performed from 200\u00a0K to 300\u00a0K and under zero bias. Fig. 9 depicts the Arrhenius plot of the inflection frequency against inverse of temperature and the EA is also highlighted with linear approximation errors. According to the literature, there are two major defect states in CIGS solar cells: N1 and N2. The activation energy for N1 is around 0.1\u00a0eV, and the origin of the N1 defect has been under debate for a long time. The possible explanations include bulk acceptor defects, CIGS/CdS interface donor defects or a non-ohmic back contact [37\u201340]. The activation energy for the N2 defect is around 0.28\u00a0eV, which is commonly attributed to a bulk acceptor level [41]. As there is no evidence for the N2 defect from the extracted EA values, it is reasonable to attribute the estimated energy level to discrete bulk acceptor defects. The R.T._KF generates an acceptor level deeper than 200\u00b0C_KF despite of a bit higher relative error with linear approximation from Fig. 9.This defect is highly possible to act as effective hole traps within the CIGS bandgap. This suggests that KF diffusion into CIGS solar cells bring in trap states, especially with post-annealing processes. This result in extraordinary high charge density values in C-V measurement. Therefore, it is concluded that the effects of surface KF-PDT is very likely to extend further deeper into the CIGS bulk, creating great impacts on electrical properties including electrical conductivities and defects. In this section, the thickness of the KF layer was studied. During the experiment, the deposition rate of the KF layer was kept the same, while the thickness was controlled via the deposition duration. A post-annealing process was not carried out, to avoid negative effects. The box plot of the 1-Sun J-V parameters of as-deposited as well as R.T._KF treated CIGS solar cells is shown in supplementary material (Fig. S5). It is clearly that compared to as-deposited CIGS absorbers, the FF of CIGS solar cells with thinner KF layer is lower. However, the significant improvement in Jsc compensates for the FF degradation, leading to improved cell efficiencies compared to the as-deposited case. For the CIGS solar cells with moderate KF layer thickness (~10\u00a0nm), all the parameters are increased. In another set of experiment (not shown), the KF thickness was increased to 15\u00a0nm and the cell efficiencies were strongly reduced (to about 6%). Therefore, to reduce the detrimental effects of the KF-PDT on FF, the thickness of the KF layer should be within the range of 10\u201315\u00a0nm. According to the literature, high-efficiency CIGS solar cells usually use a KF layer thickness of around 15\u201325\u00a0nm [7]. Additionally, the 22.9% world record CIGS solar cell was made by Solar Frontier K.K with R.T. evaporated KF followed by high-temperature (350\u00a0\u00b0C) annealing in a Se/S-containing atmosphere [42]. In contrast, in our work the optimized KF-PDT method is not obviously dependent on the deposition temperature of KF layer; thickness and post-annealing conditions dominate the final performance instead. Thus, a cost-effective method is to develop modified post-annealing process to stimulate the positive effects of R.T._KF. The optimized KF-PDT method that enhances the solar cell efficiency is highly dependent on the CIGS absorber conditions, including crystallinity and elemental distribution.  In this contribution, the influences of alkaline doping of CIGS absorbers by a post-deposition treatment were investigated systematically. Three factors that influence the CIGS solar cell properties were investigated: (i) deposition temperature, (ii) post-deposition annealing, and (iii) the thickness of the KF layer. From our characterisations, the addition of a KF layer was shown to improve the solar cell performance mainly via an improved Jsc (~30%) and an improved Voc (~5%). The surface morphology studies showed that the CIGS grain size and the surface roughness are not affected by the potassium evaporation process. Furthermore, the CdS deposition process is also not significantly affected. It was found that all the KF remnants from the evaporation process can be removed with an ammonia solution. From XPS analysis, K-induced Cu depletion was found at the CIGS surface. This facilitates the formation of CdCu antisites during CBD process. An important finding was that the VCu are more effectively occupied by K instead of In, preventing the formation of InCu antisites. The formation of KInSe2 compound was not directly observed in our work. From the diode analyses, it was found that the KF-PDT enhances both Voc and Jsc by suppressing interface recombination, whereas the FF is reduced by KF-PDT, due to increased total recombination and thickness of MoSe2 layer. Meanwhile, the C-V profiling showed extraordinarily increased charge density of CIGS solar cells with KF-PDT, which is attributed to numerous bulk defects introduced by K diffusion. More evidence from thermal admittance spectroscopy measurement demonstrates that a deeper acceptor defect was identified for KF-PDT treated CIGS absorbers. Thus, KF-PDT not only improves the junction qualities at CIGS/CdS hetero-interface; but also affect the defect properties of CIGS bulk. The post-annealing process reduces Voc and FF due to increased total. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "recombination and poorer junction quality, and we found that the post-annealing process strongly impedes the effectiveness of KF-PDT in surface modifications. Without post-annealing process, the effects of deposition temperature on overall solar cell performances are less obvious. This substantially indicate the influence of K diffusion on the defect properties of bulk CIGS during the post-annealing process. The importance of chemical compositions, such as GGI and CGI ratio, on the structural defects of CIGS bulk during KF-PDT should be focused on in the future research. To achieve higher efficiencies of CIGS solar cells, the temperature and the ambient atmosphere of the post-annealing process should be modified since they play important role in K diffusion and redistribution in the CIGS bulk. The optimal KF thickness should be less than 15\u00a0nm according to our experiments, but the value is highly dependent on the amount of VCu on the CIGS surface. Our work indicates that the KF-PDT is an effective surface treatment method to improve the performance of two-stage process deposited CIGS absorbers. Furthermore, it is found that the effect of the temperature of the KF deposition on solar cell efficiencies is negligible; only if, the post-annealing process enables homogenous potassium distribution and well-crystallized CIGS absorber. These conclusions might help to reduce the production cost of large-area CIGS PV modules.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Additionally, KF-PDT can reduce the amount of impurities in the CIGS cell, improving the cell's performance."}, {"Q": "How does the KF-PDT process work to improve the crystal structure of the CIGS absorber?", "A": "The KF-PDT process works by depositing a layer of KF (potassium fluoride) on the surface of the CIGS absorber. This layer acts as a diffusion barrier, preventing the migration of impurities from the substrate into the CIGS cell. At the same time, the KF layer also provides a potential source of fluoride ions, which can be used to improve the crystal structure of the CIGS absorber."}, {"Q": "What is the role of the annealing process in the KF-PDT method?", "A": "The annealing process is used to drive the diffusion of potassium ions into the CIGS absorber.

While TCO coating can improve the efficiency of CIGS cells, it is not as effective as the KF-PDT process in reducing the amount of impurities in the cell.

While joining techniques are application-specific (since the pair of materials and their operating conditions vary dramatically ), one of the common challenges is the difficulty in promoting the wetting and spreading of liquid metals on oxide surfaces caused by the dissimilar bonding nature of metals versus oxides . This poor wetting reduces the metal-ceramic contact area and promotes the formation of voids, resulting in a joint with low strength . For solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications, metal/oxide interfaces are commonly encountered when sealing the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte layer to a stainless steel (SS) support with a metallic braze and when producing an electronically conductive metal layer that distributes/collects current to/from ceramic SOFC electrode components . For the brazing application, the popular Ag-CuO reactive air braze (RAB) relies on the formation of a CuO surface layer to turn the non-wetting Ag/YSZ interface into a sandwiched Ag/CuO/YSZ structure with wetting Ag/CuO and CuO/YSZ interfaces . Recently, one novel approach has been to use a porous nickel interlayer to promote the wetting and spreading of Ag on YSZ. This technique is technologically promising as it produces high quality braze joints and has the potential to be extended to bond Ag-based circuit pastes on oxide electrodes . It is also fundamentally interesting as it enhances wetting by modifying the chemical and physical properties of the interface. In general, overall wetting behavior is controlled by both intrinsic and extrinsic interfacial properties . Each interface has its own intrinsic properties that govern the ideal wetting behavior on a smooth and homogeneous surface, resulting in the intrinsic wetting angle. On top of that, there are extrinsic wetting factors such as physical heterogeneities. Surface roughness is inevitably a random physical heterogeneity that alters the apparent (extrinsic) wetting angle . Hierarchical surface structures (needle-shaped wax tubes covering micro-scale protrusions of various heights) on lotus leaves, for instance, turns the slightly hydrophobic surface into a superhydrophobic one . Similarly, the micro and nano fibers on a gecko\u2019s feet are the key to achieving large adhesive forces via weak van der Waals interactions . In an analogous manner, oxide surfaces can be modified by introducing structural features on them or by adding chemical functionalities. The intrinsic and extrinsic factors together determine the overall wetting and spreading behavior. To deconvolute these factors, computational studies have the advantage that they can tune the various factors independently . Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been used to calculate surface/interface energies and derive macroscopic properties such as the work of adhesion and intrinsic wetting angle. DFT is a powerful quantum mechanical method to compute the ground state energy and electron density distribution. The electron distribution naturally reflects the chemical bond formation across the interface. The atomic charge (used in the classical picture) can be also defined by partitioning electrons to atomic cores. Typically, the energetically favorable surface and interface configurations (including surface termination, reconstruction, chemical composition, etc.) will be obtained by comparing DFT computed energetics, to represent the surface or interfaces most likely to occur experimentally . In addition, the effects of temperature, pressure, and chemical potentials on the surface and interface configuration and energetics can also be determined by combining DFT calculations with thermodynamics . However, DFT calculations typically assume flat interfaces and surfaces because they are limited by the small and periodic simulation cells used. With atomic potentials or force field (FF), large scale classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo simulations have also been used to directly obtain the intrinsic wetting angle by visually characterizing the geometry of droplets on a flat surface. The visual characterization method is straightforward and closer to experiments but obtaining accurate force fields for metal/oxide interactions remains a challenge. MD simulations can also capture wetting and spreading behavior on physically heterogeneous surfaces . For example, Koishi et\u00a0al. investigated the Wenzel/Cassie behavior of water droplets on pillared hydrophobic surfaces. Khan and Singh and Chen et\u00a0al. extensively studied the effects of pillar height and surface fraction of the pillars. In addition, MD simulations were used to simulate wetting on chemically heterogeneous surfaces . In these studies, the flat surfaces were made up of two chemically different components with striped or other patterns. While most previous MD studies have demonstrated physical and chemical effects separately; understanding how patterned Ni particles enhance the wetting and spreading of liquid Ag on oxide surfaces requires capturing both the chemical and physical heterogeneity at the interface simultaneously. Given the advantages and limitations of the two methods, it is important to capture the interfacial bonding and interaction accurately with DFT on a flat surface, then fit the interface interactions with an efficient FF to explore large scale and kinetic effects with MD simulations. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to determine how Ni particles can promote Ag spreading, how to maximize the Ag wetting area with the optimal Ni patterns, and how to generalize this technique to other materials through the development of an analytical model for joining and other applications, with a broader aim of providing a guidance to the interfacial bonding formation. This was achieved by a sequential multi-scale model to combine the accuracy of DFT calculations with large scale MD simulations by parameterizing the interface force fields.  An overview of the multi-scale modeling approach is summarized in the flowchart shown in Fig. S1. First, the manybody Sutton-Chen (SC)-type FF parameters for describing Ni-Ag, Ni-YSZ, Ag-YSZ interactions were developed. The manybody SC-type FF was employed because it can describe a range of physical properties, including melting, of Ni-Ag alloy systems . To obtain accurate Ag-YSZ interactions, the FF for YSZ was parameterized by fitting it to the DFT-computed energy of adhesion at various interface separations, Eadh(d). Second, MD simulations were performed to reveal the wetting and spreading of Ag droplets on flat or Ni patterned YSZ substrates. In the MD simulations, the atomic positions of the YSZ substrate. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "and the Ni particles were fixed, as their motions could be neglected compared to that of the liquid Ag. Therefore, the Ni-YSZ interaction was not of interest in this work. Because the YSZ substrate was fixed and only its interaction with Ag was required to influence the dynamics of Ag atoms during MD simulations, the YSZ substrate was modeled as an FCC crystalline structure to make it compatible with the SC-FF, and the substrate was referred to as YSZ*. By doing so, it was possible to reduce the complexity of simulation compared to Ref. . The universal binding energy relation (UBER) has been widely used to describe the binding energy at metal-ceramic interfaces . A good fit to this relationship indicates that the FF parameters can describe the interfacial interaction between oxides and metals. The analytical form of the UBER is expressed as: Eadh(d)=\u2212Wadh(1+d\u2212d0l)exp(\u2212d\u2212d0l) where Eadh(d) is the energy of adhesion at the separation distance d, Wadh is the calculated ideal work of adhesion at the equilibrium distance d 0, and l is a scaling length. Here, this analytical function was fit to the DFT-calculated energy of adhesion, Eadh, using the nonlinear least squares fitting technique. All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The cut-off energy was set to 500\u00a0eV for all calculations and a 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 k-point mesh was used. Electronic exchange and correlation were described with a spin-polarized local density approximation (LDA). LDA was chosen because 1) it previously yielded a work of adhesion of Ni for YSZ of 1.42 J/m 2 that agreed better with the experimentally-determined value of 1.48 J/m 2, than those generated using a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (0.49 J/m 2) and 2) GGA typically underestimates surface energy . A sandwich structure of Ag-YSZ-Ag (as shown in Fig. S1) was constructed to compute Eadh(d). The modeled 6 layers of the O-terminated-YSZ (111) slab had 4 Y atoms, 20 Zr atoms, and 46 O atoms, so its composition (Y2O3)0.09(ZrO2)0.91 was close to the most widely used YSZ composition for SOFC applications (Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92. This O-terminated-YSZ (111) surface with subsurface oxygen vacancies has been identified as the most stable surface configuration by several previous DFT studies . A detailed explanation of how the structure was built can be found in Ref.. The interplanar separation distance, d, was defined as the averaged z-position difference between the Ag atoms and the O atoms at the interface. The DFT calculated Eadh at the separation distance of d was defined as: Eadh(d)=EAg/YSZ(d)\u2212(EAg+EYSZ)2S where E Ag/YSZ(d) is the total energy of the sandwich structure of Ag-YSZ-Ag at the separation distance of d, EAg and EYSZ are the total energy of the slab of Ag and YSZ, respectively, and S is the interfacial area. The factor of 2 accounts for the two identical interfaces in the simulation cell. The E Ag/YSZ was calculated via DFT at 11 discrete separation distances, d, ranging from 1.6 \u00c5 to 7.0 \u00c5. To maintain a clearly defined d, the E Ag/YSZ(d) was first calculated with the unrelaxed interface; then the interface structure was relaxed with the atoms in the most outer layers of the Ag-YSZ-Ag sandwich model refrained from moving in a direction perpendicular to the surface, which is referred to as constraint relaxation. The SC-type many-body FF was selected for MD simulations because it includes both short- and long-range interactions and is able to reproduce surface properties . Its simple analytical form also allows convenient fitting to the UBER. For the SC-type of FF, the total energy of the system (Utot) is expressed as : Utot=\u2211i[12\u2211i\u2260jBijV(rij)\u2212ciBi\u03c1i1/2] where V(rij) refers to the pairwise repulsive potential, V(rij)=(\u03b1ijrij)n, and \u03c1i is the local energy density, \u03c1i=\u2211j\u2260i(\u03b1ijrij)m where rij is the atomic distance between atom i and atom j. The square-root dependence of \u03c1i in Eqn. (3) was inspired by the second-moment approximation to the tight-binding density of states for transition metals , but later was extended to represent the cohesive many-body contribution and has successfully described both transition and non-transition metals . Bi and Bij are parameters with the dimensions of energy, ci is a dimensionless parameter scaling the attractive term relative to the repulsive term, and \u03b1ij is a parameter with the dimensions of length to have a dimensionless form for V and \u03c1. The interaction parameters for different types of elements were determined based on a numerical average for m, n, and \u03b1, and a geometric average for B as described in Ref. . The five tunable FF parameters, m, n, c, B, and \u03b1 for Ag and Ni used in this study are the values reported previously in Ref. , where the parameter values were successfully fitted to experimental properties such as cohesive energy, density, and phonon frequencies by considering the zero-point energy effect. Here, the parameters for YSZ* were optimized by fitting the Eadh(d) calculated using a force field (EadhFF(d)) to DFT results (EadhDFT(d)). Based on the mean squared error method, the deviation (\u0394) between the EadhFF and the EadhDFT was minimized to correctly predict the trend in the UBER curve obtained from our DFT calculations: \u0394=1N\u2211d[EadhDFT(d)\u2212EadhFF(d)]2 where N is the number of data points. In Eq.\u00a0(6), the EadhFF was calculated via FF using Eq.\u00a0(2) where YSZ was replaced with YSZ* with a FCC crystalline structure based on Cu. The Ag-YSZ*-Ag sandwich structure consisted of two six-layered Ag slabs and a five-layered YSZ* slab in a 15 \u00c5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 13 \u00c5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 47 \u00c5 simulation box, as shown in Fig. S1. All MD simulations were carried out using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) in the NVT ensemble condition with a time step of 1 fs. In order to construct a liquid Ag droplet, a faceted FCC cluster of Ag atoms was created using the Wulff construction . The cluster consisted of 10,677 atoms and was placed in a 120 \u00c5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 120 \u00c5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 120 \u00c5 simulation box with vacuum space. First, the crystalline Ag cluster was overheated by increasing the temperature from 0\u00a0K to 2,800\u00a0K in the NVT. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "ensemble over 100\u00a0ps to ensure the Ag was melted. Then, the temperature was lowered to 1,300\u00a0K which is slightly higher than the melting temperature of Ag (1,235\u00a0K) over 100\u00a0ps. A liquid Ag droplet with a diameter of \u00a0\u2248\u00a074 \u00c5 was resulted and Fig. S2 presents the radial distribution function for the liquid Ag droplet, agreeing with the experimental measurement of pure molten Ag . Each Ni particle was prepared using the Wulff construction, and had 807 Ni atoms with a size of \u00a0\u2248\u00a025 \u00c5. The Ni particles were patterned on the YSZ* surfaces in different configurations. All Ag wetting simulations on various types of surfaces were performed using a NVT ensemble at 1,200\u00a0K in a 200 \u00c5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 200 \u00c5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 190 \u00c5 simulation box. After the system reached the equilibrium state where the property of interest became stationary (the variation of its average with time was close to zero), the last 450\u00a0ps were used as the production run over which relevant averaged values were calculated. The wetting area was defined as the area covered by Ag atoms within a distance of 5 \u00c5 from the YSZ* surface, where the base area covered by Ni particles was excluded. The geometric area occupied by the Ag atoms in this 5 \u00c5 thick liquid slab was projected on to the xy surface (Fig. S5(b)) and pixelized into 4 \u00c5 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 4 \u00c5 bins (Fig. S5(c) as an example). Then, the number of pixels covered by Ag atoms were counted to determine the wetting area. The enhancement in the wetting area (Apatterned/Abare) due to the patterned Ni particles was defined by the ratio between the wetting area when Ni particles were present on the surface (Apatterned) and the wetting area on the flat, bare YSZ* surface (Abare), as noted in Fig. S1. Here the traditional Sessile Drop method was employed based on Refs. due to its simplicity determining the wetting angle from atomic structures. By assuming the droplet geometry was a spherical cap, as shown in Fig. S6, the intrinsic wetting angle (\u03b8) was calculated by using the following equation : cos\u03b8=1\u2212h/rsrs=h/2+rc2/2h where h is a height of the droplet on the surface, rs is a radius of the whole sphere containing the spherical cap, and rc is a radius of the spherical cap (See Fig. S6). In this study, the instantaneous \u03b8 was obtained by measuring h and rc during the MD simulations and the average \u03b8 was calculated over the last 450\u00a0ps of the production run. To define h, the position of the interface between the liquid Ag and vacuum needed to be identified. Therefore, the density profile along the z-axis, the coordinate normal to the interface, was obtained by binning the simulation cell into 1 \u00c5 thick layers. The density distribution across the liquid-vapor interfacial region was described in a hyperbolic tangent functional form : \u03c1(z)=\u03c1l2[1\u2212tanh2(z\u2212ze)di] where \u03c1(z) is the density at the position z, \u03c1l is the density of the bulk liquid, ze is the position of the Gibbs\u2019 dividing interface between liquid/vapor, and di is a measure of inerfacial width. As an example, Fig. S4 shows the equilibrium density profile of an Ag droplet on the YSZ* surface at 1200\u00a0K and t=800 ps, indicating the Ag density dropped from 8.7 g/cm 3 (liquid) to zero (vacuum) at a position of ze=53.7 \u00c5, which is the droplet height, h. The base radius of the droplet spherical cap, rc, was calculated from the wetting area (i.e., Abare in Fig. S5(b)), assuming it had a circular shape.  Fig.\u00a01 shows the DFT-calculated adhesive energy (Eadh(d)) as a function of interfacial separation distance, d, from both relaxed and unrelaxed simulations. Atomic relaxation did not change the adhesive energies in the attractive region much, with a maximum energy difference of 0.068 J/m 2 between the two methods. However, in the repulsive region, the energy was dramatically reduced by the constraint relaxation in which the top and bottom layers of the sandwich structure were held fixed. When removing the constraint, the fully relaxed interface structure gave a Wadh=0.53J/m2 at d0=2.43 \u00c5 . Therefore, only the attractive region was used for fitting, as is typically done for this type of analysis . The adhesive energies in the attractive region were fit to the UBER formula. The obtained UBER parameters from these two methods yielded comparable Wadh values of 0.49 and 0.53 J/m 2 at a d 0 of 2.44 and 2.51 \u00c5 respectively, as shown in Fig.\u00a01. The interfacial bonding at the metal-oxide interface is mainly provided by the metal-oxygen bonds at the atomistic scale . The DFT calculated Wadh for the Ag/YSZ interface is about 0.5 J/m 2, which is much lower than the Wadh for the Ni/YSZ interface (1.4 J/m 2). This difference is caused by the differences in the metal-oxygen bond density and bond energy of the two interfaces . Since the unrelaxed interfaces provided clearly defined Eadh and d values for Ag on YSZ, in both the repulsive and attractive regions, they were further used for developing the FF parameters of YSZ*. The fitted SC FF yielded good agreement with the DFT calculated Eadh(d) and the corresponding UBER curve, as plotted in Fig.\u00a01. The optimal FF parameters for YSZ* listed in Table\u00a01 were obtained by minimizing the mean squared deviations between the DFT-computed energies and those obtained from the potential, as described by Eqn.\u00a06. The resulting potential yielded a minimum deviation of 0.048 J/m 2 based on Eqn.\u00a06. Here, it is noticeable that the FF in the repulsive region (d\u00a0<\u00a0d 0) yielded relatively worse agreement where the deviation was 0.104 J/m 2; however, in the attractive region (d\u00a0>\u00a0d 0) it provided a more accurate value of 0.015 J/m 2. This suggests that the obtained FF could describe the adhesive energies precisely in the overall separation distance range, but it exaggerated the repulsion between Ag and YSZ* by \u00a0\u2248\u00a0 0.104 J/m 2 when they were closer than the equilibrium distance of 2.4 \u00c5. Figs.\u00a02 (a)\u2013(d) show snapshots of MD simulations with two. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "different surfaces: one is the bare YSZ* surface (Figs.\u00a02(a) and (b)), and the other is the Ni particle linearly patterned YSZ* surface (Figs.\u00a02(c) and (d)). Fig.\u00a02(a) shows that the Ag droplet on the bare YSZ* surface started as a spherical shape with a point contact on the YSZ* surface initially and evolved during the first 100\u00a0ps until it reached the equilibrium state. At the equilibrium state, the Ag droplet on the bare YSZ surface formed a typical dome-like shape with a contact angle of 116\u2218. In comparison, in Fig.\u00a02(c), the liquid Ag droplet was initially placed in the middle of two Ni particles. Ag completely wetted the Ni surface (Fig. S3) but did not wet the YSZ* surface (Fig.\u00a02(a)). Therefore, once the droplet reached the Ni particles, the Ni particles anchored the liquid Ag droplet and Ag tended to stretch towards the Ni particles. Due to the stronger adhesion between Ni and Ag, the wetting area could be elongated in the direction of the Ni particles (Fig.\u00a02(d)). To quantify the effect of the Ni particles on the wetting of Ag, the wetting area of Ag was tracked in the MD simulations. Fig.\u00a02(e) shows the time evolution of the Ag wetting area on the bare YSZ* surface (Abare) and on the YSZ* surface with two Ni-particles, as an example of a patterned surface, (Apatterned). The spreading of the Ag droplet occurred in the first \u00a0~\u00a0150\u00a0ps and the wetting area was stabilized after 200\u00a0ps. Therefore, the average wetting area was reported over the last 450\u00a0ps of the 800\u00a0ps production run. The average wetting area of Ag on the bare YSZ* was 4577 \u00c52 and that on the linear-Ni-patterned YSZ surface was 6322 \u00c52, yielding a 38 % enhancement of the wetting area, i.e., Apatterned/Abare=1.38. Therefore, it is obvious that Ni particles are beneficial for enlarging the Ag wetting area. After confirming the mechanism by which the wetting area can be enhanced when introducing Ni-particles on the YSZ* surface, it became of interest to investigate if different configurations of Ni particles would affect the magnitude of the enhancement; and if so, which configurations would maximize the wetting area. To address these questions, four different configurations were analyzed as shown in Fig.\u00a03 (a): a linear configuration with two Ni particles, a triangular configuration with three Ni particles, a square configuration with four Ni particles, and a hexagonal configuration with six Ni particles. In each configuration, the interparticle spacing, defined as the distance between the nearest Ni particles, a. was varied. Fig.\u00a03(b) shows the enhancement of wetting area with respect to the interparticle spacing in each configuration. The error bars are the standard deviation during the MD simulations. The wetting enhancement first increased with interparticle spacing until a critical spacing, where the Ag no longer interacted with all Ni particles, was reached. The magnitude of the wetting enhancement increased with the number of Ni particles but the critical spacing decreased with the number of Ni particles. With the line configuration, as the interparticle spacing increased, the enhancement was also improved. The enhancement showed a maximum at a=105 \u00c5, beyond which the Ag droplet could no longer interact with both Ni particles. The gap between two Ni particles at the maximum interparticle spacing was \u00a0\u2248\u00a080 \u00c5 (=a\u22122\u00d7D/2) which is slightly larger than the size of the Ag droplet (2R\u00a0\u2248\u00a074 \u00c5). This implies that, on a per Ni unit cell basis, the optimal interparticle spacing is related to the size of the Ag droplet and of the Ni particles. It is also worth noting that when a was smaller than 40 \u00c5, the enhancement was slightly less than 1, meaning the Ni particles exerted a negative effect on enhancing the wetting area. This is because when the Ni particles are too close, they cannot elongate the Ag droplet, but just block the available YSZ* surface for Ag to wet. The critical interparticle spacing for other configurations was also revealed, indicated as asterisks in Fig.\u00a03(b). Especially when using the triangular and the square configuration, the enhancement ratio dropped beyond the critical interparticle spacing and then followed along the linear configuration plot. This was because the distribution of Ni particles was so sparse that only two Ni particles among the three/four Ni particles took part in pulling the Ag droplet. In the case of the hexagonal configuration, the maximum interparticle spacing was a=55 \u00c5. When a was slightly larger than the maximum spacing, only four Ni particles were involved in the enhancing mechanism; when a increased more (a\u00a0>\u00a057 \u00c5), three Ni particles were involved. Thus, the enhancement ratio did not fall and follow the plot of the linear configuration. Fig.\u00a03(b) shows that the maximum wetting area enhancement can be achieved by using a hexagonal configuration. Specifically, the pattern in Fig.\u00a03(b) shows that the wetting area was improved by a factor of 2.24. Considering all five 2D Bravais lattices (monoclinic, rectangular, centered rectangular, hexagonal, and square), for a given size of Ag droplet, the maximum wetting area is reached by the reducing the overall height of the Ag droplet until it completely spreads over the substrate to a circular shape, which is nearly achieved by the hexagonal configuration of Ni particles. Based on these insights into wetting area enhancement, an analytical model was developed to determine the maximum amount by which the wetting area could be enlarged by patterning Ni particles on different surfaces. Given the radius of the initial spherical Ag droplet R, the size of the Ni particles, D, and the intrinsic wetting angle of Ag on the bare surfaces, \u03b8, it was assumed that the Ag droplet was spread into a truncated cone-like shape (with a circular base) by the patterned Ni particles (Fig.\u00a04 ). Specifically, it was assumed that the Ag in region (I), the spherical cap above the height of D as the striped region in Fig.\u00a04 (left), would mainly contribute to the enhancement of the wetting area by moving downward into the final truncated cone-shaped droplet. A base radius of region (I) was denoted. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "as rt and that of whole spherical cap was rc. Fig.\u00a04 shows two scenarios: (a) rc\u00a0>\u00a0rt mainly for droplets which wet the surface and (b) rc\u00a0<\u00a0rt mainly for non-wetting droplets. The analytical model had to treat these two scenarios separately. In scenario (a), the peripheral region outside of the cylinder had to be included due to wetting. In scenario (b), the spread droplet had a cylinder-like shape with a radius of rm. Thus, the enhancement of wetting area was: ApatternedAbare={(rm+rc\u2212rt)2rc2forrt<rcrm2rc2forrt>rc. The detailed derivation is presented in the Supplemental Material and the analytical equation for these radii are listed in (Table S1). Based on the analytical equations, it can be seen that the wetting enhancement with the patterned Ni particles is dependent only on R, D, and \u03b8. Specifically, the model indicates that using smaller Ni particles leads to a thinner Ag cone-shaped disk that covers a larger area. This model holds true when h\u00a0>\u00a0D, or (1\u2212cos\u03b8)2(2+cos\u03b8)>4(R/D)3, and suggests the enhancement increases with increasing wetting angles (Fig. S7). The developed analytical model was validated with MD simulations of four different metal-oxide interface systems. The intrinsic wetting angle of a liquid on a substrate (\u03b8) is related to the work of adhesion of the liquid to a solid substrate (Wadh) and the surface tension of the liquid (\u03b3l), according to the Young-Dupre equation : Wadh=\u03b3l(1+cos\u03b8). Thus, a change in Wadh leads to a change in wetting angle when the same liquid metal (\u03b3l is constant) spreads on different substrates. Based on this principle, new FF parameters for different substrate materials were generated. The depth of the adhesive energy curve (Wadh) is mainly subject to the values of B and c in Eqn. (3). Specifically, c contributes to the attractive pair potential and B is responsible for both the attractive and repulsive pair potentials. Table\u00a01 lists the FF parameters representing various substrate materials, namely YSZ*, slightly wettable (W1), largely wettable (W2), and non-wettable (NW) cases used here. The four FF parameters yielded different values of Wadh, \u03b8, as well as different adhesive energy curves, Eadh(d), as shown in Fig.\u00a05 (a). The calculated wetting angles and the cross-sectional views of the Ag droplet on various surfaces are depicted in Fig.\u00a05(b). The Wadh of the W1 case and that of the NW case differed from that of the YSZ* surface by about \u00a0\u00b1\u00a0 0.3J/m 2, respectively. As such, they represent a difference of the Ag wetting behavior on more/less wettable surfaces compared to the YSZ* surface. Additionally, the W2 case was investigated to clearly represent a wetting surface because the wetting angle of Ag on the W1 surface was 83.9\u2218 which is only slightly less than 90\u2218 which serves as a wetting/non-wetting criterion. Since the calculated wetting angle of the W2 case was 68.5\u2218; the W2 surface was undoubtedly wettable. In Table\u00a02 , the mean wetting angles calculated from MD simulations are listed with their standard deviations. Standard deviations of the mean value are attributed to fluctuation of the h and rs values in Eqn. (7). The wetting angle on the bare Ni surface was seen to be approximately 0\u2218 since the Ag droplet fully wet the entire Ni surface as shown in Fig. S3, agreeing with the experimentally observed wetting angle of 9\u2218 . The calculated wetting angle on the YSZ* surface was 115.8\u2218 which is in between two different experimental observations, \u00a0120\u2218 at 550\u2218 C and \u00a096\u2218 at 1,000\u2218 C , and all cases showed that liquid Ag does not wet YSZ. The analytical model was compared with the results from MD simulations with four different substrate materials: NW, YSZ*, W1, and W2. In Fig.\u00a06 (a), the analytical model is plotted by a solid line and the data points indicate the results from the MD simulations. The vertical error bars represent the standard deviation of the area enhancement and the horizontal error bars indicate the standard deviation of the wetting angle. The analytical model and the MD simulation results show the same trend: the effect of Ni-patterning on the enhancement of wetting area becomes more significant as the wettability of substrate becomes worse. The Ni particle will introduce certain surface roughness. Palasantza and Hosson have systematically studied the effect of surface roughness parameters on the apparent (extrinsic) wetting angle . The Ni-particle patterned surface should have a low roughness exponent and the D/a ratio is similar to the long-wavelength ratio defined in Ref. , where they found the effect of low roughness exponent on contact angle is more distinct. However, surface roughness alone generally amplifies the original wetting behavior . Fig\u00a06 shows that the wetting area all increased, implying that all wetting angles decreased, due to the patterned Ni particles regardless of the initial wetting angle. This further confirmed that Ni particles introduced combined chemical and physical effects, that can even change a non-wetting surface to almost complete wetting. In the case of the YSZ* surface, the maximum enhancement ratios of the four different configurations (Fig.\u00a03) are plotted in Fig.\u00a06(a). They are the maximum enhancement ratio with a given configuration and are also indicated as asterisks in Fig.\u00a03(b). When the Ni particles were patterned in a hexagonal shape, the maximum enhancement ratio from the MD simulation was 2.24, which agrees well with the analytical result of 2.20. The fact that the hexagonal-patterned Ni provides a wetting enhancement that is only less than 2% different than the maximum wetting area enhancement predicted by the analytical model, indicated it is an optimal 2D pattern for increasing wetting area of the liquid droplets. As seen in Fig.\u00a03(a) and in Section\u00a03.1.4, the hexagonal configuration with 6 Ni particles allowed for an Ag droplet to be spread the most. Based on this finding, the maximum enhancement for NW, W1, and W2 surfaces was determined based on the hexagonal configuration by varying the interparticle spacing, a. Fig.\u00a06(a) shows good agreement in the main trends between the analytical model and the MD simulations. The average difference between them was about 3.5% with a maximum difference of 8.3% for the W1. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "case. For two wettable cases (W1 and W2), the analytical results were found to be slightly underestimated compared to the MD results due to the simplifications of the analytical model. There are some details excluded from the analytical model, leading to the slight discrepancy between the analytical and MD results. The obvious one is that the analytical model underestimates the wetting enhancement on wetting interfaces (W1 and W2). The analytical model assumed the height of Ag spread on a surface is the same as the height of the Ni particle (D). In Fig.\u00a06(b), a solid red line indicates a position of the D. On W1 and W2 surfaces, the upper surface of Ag appears like a concave meniscus, implying that the height of the Ag disk in the middle is smaller than D. This is related to a capillary force resulting in a liquid bridge connecting two solid bodies . Ignoring this effect in the analytical model leads to slight underestimation of the wetting area under wetting condition. Other details include the shape of the peripheral region and the shape of Ni particle. The analytical model assumed the wetting angle of Ag was maintained in the peripheral region, indicated by the red arrow in Fig.\u00a06(b), while it wraps around the Ni particle in the MD simulations. The analytical model assumed the Ni was a perfect sphere, so it doesn\u2019t cover any contact area; but it has a shape in the MD simulation, although its base area was deducted from the contact area of Ag. Overall, these details are not significant and cancel each other out; therefore, it is not likely that their effects affect the main trend.  Liquid silver cannot wet and spread well on oxide surfaces at joint interfaces for silver circuits and current collectors in various applications such as SOFCs, solar cells, and silicon-based electronic devices . The recent experimental studies of Zhou et\u00a0al. , [], Hu et\u00a0al. , and Nicholas et al. [] showed that porous Ni interlayers could be used to promote Ag wetting on YSZ, sapphire, and other substrates. However, the optimal design of the Ni structure has been unknown. This study showed that extrinsic wetting factors overcame the intrinsic non-wetting behavior by using the multi-scale modeling method. That is, even if the intrinsic wetting angle of Ag on the oxide surface was greater than 90\u2218, the wetting area could be increased by patterning Ni particles on it. In detail, it was found that the good wetting of Ni by Ag allowed the Ag droplets to anchor themselves to the Ni particles. By doing so, the wetting area of Ag was able to be more than doubled with hexagonally patterned Ni particles with an interparticle spacing of 55 \u00c5 for Ni particles 25 \u00c5 in diameter. Further, an analytical model was developed to formulate the enhancement of the wetting area as a function of the intrinsic wetting angle, size of Ag droplet, and size of Ni particles. The analytical model was validated with MD simulations on substrates representing four different adhesion properties with Ag. It was clearly shown that the patterned Ni contributed to a much larger enhancement on non-wetting surfaces (with increasing intrinsic wetting angle) than on wetting surfaces. This study also showed the maximum wetting enhancement could be achieved with only a monolayer of hexagonal patterned Ni particles at a distance that is comparable to the Ag particle size. Hence, the porous structured Ni particles initially used in experiments to enhance wetting may not be necessary. Furthermore, the lower amount of Ni particles used in the monolayer hexagonal pattern (compared to porous nickel structures) may also reduce any undesirable impacts of Ni oxidation on the overall joint adhesion and electronic contact. The idea of introducing a patterned third-body particle layer (P) for enhanced wetting, spreading and adhesion of liquid material A on a substrate (S) can be generalized to other metal, ceramic, or polymer systems. As long as the third-body particles are insoluble in/wet by material A as well as adhere to the substrate S, with or without pre-sintering, they can chemically-and-physically change the non-wetting S surface to wetting for liquid material A. Further, once the intrinsic wetting angle of A on S is identified, the maximum enhancement in the wetting area can be readily predicted by the analytical model.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The collision of ions onto a surface leads to a large variety of processes often strongly dependent on the projectile parameters, projectile kinetic energy, impact angle and surface temperature as well as crystal orientation [5]. The projectile may be adsorbed to [6] or implanted into [7,8] the surface, predominantly concomitant with neutralization. The projectile may also be scattered from the surface, often in a different charge state or sometimes chemically modified due to fragmentation [9] or reactions with surface atoms [10]. Momentum transfer to atoms of the target surface can result in the emission of atoms or ions from the surface (sputtering). Hollow cathode [11,12], glow discharges [13] and magnetron sputtering [14] are common tools for physical vapor deposition and thin film formation. For insulating surfaces, efficient removal of neutral and ionized target particles due to the potential rather than the kinetic energy of impinging slow, highly charged ions, has been reported (potential sputtering) [15]. Electron emission from the target surface is another common reaction. For electron bombardment, the ion induced electron emission yield (IEEY) has been investigated in great detail for various materials [16,17] and the presence of oxides [18,19] or adsorbate layers [20,21]. Many of these studies have been motivated due the importance of the ion induced electron emission yield for scanning electron microscopy [22], electron accelerators [23] and high-power microwave devices [24]. For ions as projectiles, substantially fewer studies are found in the literature [25\u201327]. The ion induced emission of electrons is the first step in the detection of ions in a secondary electron multiplier device [2,28]. As in the case of sputtering of surface atoms, the emission of electrons from a surface is promoted by the kinetic energy (kinetic emission) [29] and the potential energy (potential emission) [30\u201332] of the projectile. Potential emission can be related to electronic transitions between the projectile and the surface before the collision has taken place. It arises from an Auger-type process [30] and has a threshold energy that is twice the surface work function of the target. In contrast, kinetic emission is initiated after the projectile makes contact with the surface. If the energy deposited into the electrons of the target surface is sufficiently high, more than one electron can be emitted. Ion induced emission of electrons is essential in many technical plasma devices as an important source for generating further ions, including magnetron sputtering sources. In a recent study, Raggl et al. [33] investigated the plasma parameters during direct current magnetron sputtering of molybdenum targets made by different manufacturing processes. A significantly enhanced electron density was found for the target with the smallest grain size. Differences in electron densities during magnetron sputtering have a pronounced impact on the performance of sputtering targets used in industrial applications since the deposition rate is governed by the sputtering yield. Higher electron densities result in more ions that can sputter more efficiently the target. Raggl et al. proposed that a different ion induced electron emission yield \u03b3 is the reason for the observed target dependent electron density [33]. In order to shed light onto this hypothesis, a new instrument has been designed and constructed to measure \u03b3 with high spatial resolution. For targets with a grain size in the millimeter regime the IEEY of individual grains with different orientation can be measured as well.  For singly-charged projectile ions, as used in the present study, the ion induced electron emission yield \u03b3 can be determined by measuring the current of the projectile ions and the current of the emitted electrons: \u03b3=Ie/Ii It has to be considered that the current, measured on the target, is the sum on the incoming projectile current and the outgoing electron current. Spatial resolution of ion beams below 50\u00a0nm has been achieved for kinetic energies in the several ten keV energy range [3,34]. However, the energy range of interest for magnetron sputtering is a few 100\u00a0eV only. In combination with the required high current densities for efficient sputter cleaning of the target, the resulting high ion density leads to space charging which inevitably increases the spot size of a focused ion beam. The design of our instrument, schematically shown in Fig. 1 , is similar to a previously published setup by Choi at al. [25]. However, important differences will be explained below. Ions are formed by electron ionization in an ion source with a similar design as a hot-cathode pressure gauge. Electrons are emitted from a heated filament and accelerated to a cylindrically shaped grid that is kept at a potential 120\u00a0V positive with respect to the filament. Thereby, the electrons ionize argon inside the grid close to the maximum of the electron ionization cross section [35,36]. In contrast, Choi at al. [25] accelerate the electrons from a heated filament into the direction of the ion beam. The potential of the region where the electrons can ionize rare gas atoms is ill-defined which reduces the ionization efficiency and leads to a wide distribution of the kinetic energy of the ions. In the present setup the ions are extracted from the opening at the bottom of the grid by a weak penetrating field which guarantees a narrow kinetic energy spread of the ion beam. The ions are accelerated and focused by a set of electrostatic lenses to the target surface. The beam is collimated by a 0.5\u00a0mm aperture that also shields the electron collector from the incoming ion beam. The width and shape of the ion beam at the surface was determined by measuring the current on a 0.03\u00a0mm diameter wire that was mechanically moved across the ion beam in\u00a0x\u00a0and y-direction. Fig. 2 shows this measurement and the resulting ion beam profile. The full width at half maximum of the ion beam is 240\u00a0\u00b5m. This is about three times the beam width stated by Choi et al. [25]. Deconvolution with a. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Gaussian profile corresponding to the width of the wire does only reduce the measured curves insignificantly, i.e., to 238\u00a0\u00b5m. Choi et al. [25] used a pair of deflectors to move the ion beam across the target surface. Thereby, the impact angle is reduced from 90\u00b0 at the center to smaller values off the beam axis. In the present case, a piezo stage (Physik Instrumente \u201cPI Q-521.34U\u201d, bidirectional repeatability 50\u00a0nm) controls the target position. The whole stage is insulated from the target and kept on ground. It is fitted into a vacuum chamber pumped by a turbo molecular pump (Pfeiffer HiPace 700) and an oil free rotary vane pump. The base pressure is 5.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 Pa. The argon can be inserted by a gas pressure controller (pressurecontrolsolutions.nl) which is driven by a PID control loop. The feedback is taken from the analog signal of the pressure gauge (Pfeiffer IKR 251). The valve system can be operated via PC. The experiment was designed with a CAD software (Solidworks) and the file was taken as an input to simulate the flightpath of the argon ions with a computer software (Simion 8.1). The impact energy was set to 420\u00a0eV. By collision with the surface, secondary electrons are ejected from the surface and get accelerated to the Faraday cup that is biased 10\u00a0V positive relative to the surface. With two picoampere meters RBD 9103, the currents on the target surface and on the Faraday cup are measured every 500\u00a0ms for typically 150\u00a0s. Both currents exhibit a temporal behavior that can be fitted by exponential curves (see Fig. 3 a). Impurities like adsorption layers of water, hydrocarbons or metal-oxides on the surface will be removed by the projectile ion beam. During this time, the values of both currents drop asymptotically to the values of the pure surface material. After some time, these asymptotic values can be determined by exponential fits to the recorded data. The ion induced electron emission yield determined from the corresponding current values (see Fig. 3b) exhibits also a clear exponential decay which corresponds to an asymptotic value that would be reached after longer irradiation times. This asymptotic value \u03b30 can also be determined via exponential curves fitted to the data. Most of the time, \u03b3 decreases exponentially with the irradiation time (see Fig. 3b), which agrees well with the removal of a thin oxide layer [19,37] or an adsorbate film from a metal surface. The accuracy of \u03b30 increases with the measurement time. Reliable results could be achieved for irradiation times as low as 40\u00a0s. However, after an irradiation of typically 150\u00a0s, the target surface is moved by the two-dimensional linear piezo stage to the next spot of the surface. Andrianova et al. observed a strong dependence of the IEEY for glassy carbon materials on the temperature and ion current density [38]. Pronounced jumps of \u03b3(T) are assigned to a reduced annealing temperature for increasing current density. In the present study, the ion energy is a factor 100 and the current density almost five orders of magnitude lower than in ref [38]. Thus, we expect that under the present conditions, radiation induced defects and their annealing will be of less importance. Furthermore, Andrianova et al. did not observe this effect for other carbon-based materials [38]. The setup is controlled by a self-written software. For the user interface open frameworks based on HTML5, CSS and JavaScript are used, so it can run on every modern internet browser in the same network. Requests from the user interface are handled by a python-based web server using the Django framework. Communication to measurement devices and power sources is done via USB and RS-232 serial connections. For each position of the linear stages, data points are truncated by the first 10 values to exclude influences of the moving stage and possible setting of the pico-ammeters. The resulting points are fitted by an exponential decay function (see Fig. 3b). If the decay rate is not in a reasonable range, which happens in less than 1% of the cases, \u03b30 is determined from a median fit of the last third of the measured current values. The deviation from the asymptotic value of this approximation is less than 2%. The \u03b30 value of a corresponding position on the target surface results in a color-coded pixel of a map of the ion induced electron emission yield of the target surface. A stainless-steel surface was cleaned with Piranha solution (50:50 v/v solution of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and concentrated sulfuric acid 95\u201398%(H2SO4), both obtained from Sigma Aldrich). An image of the Tyrolian heraldic eagle was cut from an adhesive film using a laser CNC cutter and glued to the clean stainless-steel surface. The target surface was then loaded into a PVD sputter coater (safematic CCU-010) and a 50\u00a0nm thick Au layer was applied starting from a sputtering target (Au 99.99%). (The layer thickness was measured using the built-in quartz microbalance. By pulling off the eagle shaped adhesive film, an eagle made of stainless steel was surrounded by a 50\u00a0nm thick Au layer. SEM images of the target sample were measured utilizing a Raith Nanofabrication eLine Plus instrument. The optical images were taken with a reflected light microscope Leica ZG APO with a Leica DFC 420 Camera. The individually recorded partial areas were put together to form an image using the panorama photo stitcher software Hugin. XPS was performed with a Thermo MultiLab 2000 spectrometer with an alpha 110 hemispherical analyzer (Thermo Electron) [39] in the constant analyzer energy mode (surveys with pass energy 100\u00a0eV, energy resolution 2\u00a0eV; detailed spectra with pass energy 25\u00a0eV, energy resolution 0.8\u00a0eV). A twin crystal monochromator provided Al K\u03b1 radiation (1486.6\u00a0eV) with a focus of 650 \u00b5m in diameter. After background subtraction, the areas of the detected XPS core-level peaks were used to calculate the atomic concentration (at. %) of each constituent, taking into account the analyzer\u2019s transmission function and the sensitivity factors of the elements.

At the border between the gold covered section and the region that was covered with the adhesive film, additional material most likely from the glue is found. In the photo it appears as a bright rim and in the microscope image as a dark region. In order to obtain more information on the film structure and the border region of the gold film, images with a scanning electron microscope were taken at various magnifications and shown in Fig. 5 . SEM images of the right wing of the eagle and enlarged sections of the gold-steel transition region. The gold film is not completely covering the steel substrate and exhibits holes and scratches. The removal of the adhesive film was leading the ruptures and backfolding of the gold film and some additional impurities, most likely from the glue. For a chemical analysis, XPS scans were taken at various positions of the sample. The spot size of the Al K\u03b1 X-ray beam (1486.6\u00a0eV) was focused to a diameter of 0.65\u00a0mm, which enabled the detailed chemical analysis of the gold film (Fig. 6 a), the eagle shaped stainless-steel region (Fig. 6b), and of the border regions (Fig. 6c). Four sections where selected that cover the region where specific XPS peaks for the elements Au, C, O and Fe can be found. The gold film shows a clear peak of the Au4f and its spin\u2013orbit component at 84\u00a0eV and 87.7\u00a0eV, respectively. Much less gold can be seen at the border region (b) and even less at the stainless-steel region (c). Except for the border region, the well-known C1s peaks for C C bonding and C O bonding at 284.8\u00a0eV and 288.5\u00a0eV can be resolved. At the transition region from the gold to the stainless-steel region (b), an intense peak is observed that is shifted towards lower binding energy. Nevertheless, this measurement confirms our assumption that residues of the glue from the adhesive film are present in this region. The presence of the iron Fe2p peaks (metallic iron at 706.7\u00a0eV and Fe2O3 at 710.8\u00a0eV, as well as their spin\u2013orbit components with a \u0394metal of 13.1\u00a0eV) at the gold film (a) indicates that the 50\u00a0nm thick film is not covering the stainless-steel surface completely. The O1s peak at 530\u00a0eV binding energy can be assigned to metal oxides, i.e., Fe2O3 and the peak at 531.7\u00a0eV binding energy matches perfectly organic C O. During a 227-hour measurement, the ion induced electron emission yield \u03b3 has been measured for the center region of the target surface (13.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016\u00a0mm) with a step width of 0.2\u00a0mm. The resulting color coded \u03b3 values are shown in Fig. 7 . A more detailed scan of two sections, indicated by red rectangles were measured with a step width 0.1\u00a0mm. As expected, a different value of \u03b3 is measured for the gold and stainless-steel surface with only very small deviations. Scratches and holes in the gold film are also confirmed by this measurement. The border region of the gold film that appears very bright in the photo and dark in the optical and electron microscope image exhibits the lowest ion induced electron emission yield. This agrees well with organic material as indicated by the XPS analysis. At an impact energy of 420\u00a0eV the dominant mechanism for ion induced electron emission upon Ar+ collisions is potential emission [29]. The average \u03b3 value for the gold film of 0.107\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006. This is more than twice the value determined by Lakits et al. for polycrystalline gold irradiated with Ar+ at 400\u00a0eV, which is 0.04 [29]. A possible explanation is the presence of doubly-charged argon ions in our projectile ion beam. The average \u03b3 value for the eagle shaped stainless-steel part of the surface is 0.069\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005 and for the glue covered parts of the target 0.023\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005. A polycrystalline Si target with a grain size of a few mm was used to probe a possible ion induced electron emission dependence on the crystal orientation. The sample was cut from a polycrystalline silicon sheet obtained from Herbert Arnold GmbH & Co.KG, used for solar cell production. The root-mean-squared roughness was determined via AFM (Naio AFM, Nanosurf AG) measurements at various positions of the sample to be 0.9\u00a0\u00b5m. Fig. 8 a) shows a photo of a 12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0mm2 region of the sample and the differently colored regions might be assigned to different grains with different orientation. In Fig. 8b) a color-coded plot of the ion induced electron emission yield for the same region is shown. The \u03b3 values range from 0.05 (yellow) to 0.08 (blue-green) with an average value of 0.065\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016 for the selected region. The structures clearly visible in the optical image cannot be seen in the ion induced electron emission yield. However, a clear pattern is also observed in Fig. 8b) which could be exactly reproduced during a second 2d-scan of the surface. A scanning electron microscope image of the very same sample (Fig. 8c) shows the ion induced electron emission yield for electrons colliding with 25\u00a0keV with the silicon target. The agreement between the two images that represent ion induced electron emission upon Ar+ and electron bombardment is much better then with the optical image (Fig. 8a). Please note that the scanning electron microscope image nicely shows the scanning pattern of the Ar+ ion beam. According to the literature the sputtering efficiency depends on the crystal orientation [40]. The present results indicate that the grain size dependent electron densities determined by Raggl et al. [33] is not the result of the crystal orientation, but on the chemical composition, such as oxidation or adsorbed species. With decreasing grain size, the relative amount of grain boundaries increases. Oxidation of a surface preferentially happens at grain boundaries and the ion induced electron emission yield for metal oxides is typically larger than for pure metallic surfaces. This agrees very well with the oxygen concentrations determined by Raggl. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "et al. [33] for their molybdenum targets. The oxygen content of their samples was inversely proportional to the average grain size.  With a new experimental setup, the ion induced electron emission yield upon Ar+ impact at 420\u00a0eV onto a surface can be determined with a special resolution of 240\u00a0\u00b5m. The current density as well as the kinetic energy of the projectile beam is comparable to DC magnetron sputtering with argon. When irradiating a new target position, the ion induced electron emission yield exhibits typically an exponential time dependence which can be associated with sputter cleaning of the surface and the removal of an adsorbate layer. From the temporal dependence, a steady-state value can be determined which is highly reproducible. The method was thoroughly tested with a gold covered stainless steel sample. The ion induced electron emission yields determined at various regions of the surface agree well with the elemental analysis performed with XPS. In case of a polycrystalline silicon wafer with an average grain size of about 5\u00a0mm, the ion induced electron emission yield does not depend on the crystal orientation and also the grain boundaries cannot be resolved. The same is also true for the ion induced electron emission yield upon 25\u00a0keV electron bombardment utilizing a scanning electron microscope. The electron density in the plasma of magnetron sputtering is an important parameter that determines the sputtering yield, which is strongly influenced by the ion induced electron emission yield of the sputtering target. Whereas Raggl et al. recently demonstrated a grain size dependence of the ion induced electron emission yield for differently produced molybdenum sputtering targets [32], our results indicate that both the chemical composition of the surface itself as well as possible oxide and adsorbate layers also have a strong effect on the ion induced electron emission yield and thus the sputtering yield.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2020.147095.txt", "paper": ["Zinc oxide is a promising semiconductor material with a wide application field that includes light emitting diodes (LEDs) [1,2], field-effect transistors [3], photodetectors [4,5], artificial intelligence systems [6\u20137], and solar cells [8]. It exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties such as a direct bandgap of 3.37\u00a0eV, an exciton binding energy of 60\u00a0meV, piezoelectricity, and transparency [9\u201312]. ZnO films have been fabricated by different techniques, including chemical vapor deposition [13], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [14,15], radiofrequency magnetron sputtering [16\u201318], sol\u2013gel methods [19\u201321], spray pyrolysis [22\u201323], and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [24\u201326]; these previous studies have shown that the ZnO film thickness is crucial in determining the properties of both doped and undoped ZnO thin films and ZnO-based devices. Table 1 shows that the film thickness has various effects on different properties of ZnO films, including growth orientation, defect (mainly oxygen vacancy) concentration, conductivity, band gap, and root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness. The film thickness effect on the properties of Al-, Ga-, and Cu-doped ZnO materials have also been investigated [17,19,21,23]. Baek et al. studied the influence of the thickness of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) front contact layers on the efficiency of radial p\u2013n junction silicon solar cells; when the thickness was increased from 15 to 48\u00a0nm, the short circuit current and power conversion efficiency increased, but they both decreased when further increasing the thickness to 80\u00a0nm due to the reduced film transmittance [14]. Lahmar et al. investigated the effect of the ZnO buffer layer thickness on the properties of electrodeposited p-Cu2O/n-ZnO/n-AZO/fluorine-doped tin oxide heterojunction solar cells, finding that a 50\u00a0nm value resulted in higher transmittance and current density compared to thicker ZnO buffer layers since the Cu2O crystallinity and conductivity decreased when the ZnO thickness exceeded 50\u00a0nm [8]. Oxygen vacancies (Vo, a kind of n-type defect in ZnO) are another important factor for the properties of ZnO films because they are a kind of intrinsic n-type defects that can prevent the formation of p-type ZnO with high carrier concentration and conductivity. The Vo concentration of ZnO films prepared by sputtering, PLD, or metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) can be controlled by using oxygen partial pressures [27\u201332]. Both Xiong et al. and Singh et al. reported a conversion from n- to p-type for ZnO films fabricated by sputtering when increasing the oxygen partial pressure [27,28]; it happened because the oxygen vacancies are easily formed in ZnO at low oxygen partial pressures but can be suppressed at higher partial pressures, enabling the formation of p-type ZnO. Yu et al. stated that increasing the oxygen partial pressure can decrease the Vo defect concentration and the oxygen vacancy-induced green-yellow photoluminescence (PL) emission intensity in PLD-prepared ZnO films [29]. Ma et al. also demonstrated that an oxygen partial pressure increase in MOVPE systems can decrease the Vo defect concentration and the carrier concentration, enhancing the ZnO film resistivity [30]. Moreover, MOVPE-prepared p-type ZnO films have been obtained under high oxygen partial pressures as a result of the decreased Vo defect concentration and increased Zn vacancies [31]. However, for the aforementioned preparation methods, a decrease in ZnO film crystallinity was also observed when increasing the oxygen partial pressure [28,30,31]. In recent works, we have suggested a method to passivate the oxygen vacancies in ZnO films with totally c-axis growth prepared through ALD by using H2O2 as the oxygen precursor, which can provide an oxygen-rich environment for the ZnO growth [33,34]. Despite the studies about the effect of film thickness on ZnO films prepared by various methods, the role of the film thickness in determining the properties of ALD-prepared ZnO samples with the properties of oxygen vacancy-passivated and totally c-axis growth has not been reported, yet. However, previous researches have demonstrated that oxygen vacancy in ZnO plays different roles as the thickness increases [22,24]. H2O is the oxygen precursor commonly used for preparing ZnO films via ALD and the resulting material usually exhibits a large Vo defect concentration and coexistence among the growth orientations of (1 0 0), (0 0 2), and (1 1 0) [34\u201336]; nonetheless, an investigation about the thickness effect on the properties of oxygen vacancy-passivated ZnO prepared via ALD would better approximate the real thickness effect on perfect ZnO films (i.e., without defects). Therefore, it is important to study the thickness effect on the growth orientation, surface morphology, grain size, strain, transmittance, optical bandgap, Vo defect concentration, and Hall properties (carrier concentration, carrier mobility, and resistivity) of oxygen vacancy-passivated and c-axis grown ZnO films prepared via ALD. The results showed an interesting difference with respect to the previous research about ZnO films fabricated by ALD with H2O as the oxygen precursor [15]. And it can also provide the basic knowledge about the thickness effect on the properties of ALD prepared oxygen vacancy-passivated and c-axis grown ZnO using H2O2 when used to prepare ZnO-based devices.  The ALD preparation was carried out with a traveling wave-type Lucida D100 system (NCD Technology, Inc.). Diethylzinc (DEZ) (Hansol Chemical Co., Ltd.) and H2O2 (50% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the Zn and O precursors, respectively, and kept separate. N2 gas (99.999%) was used as both the purge and transport gas, at a flow rate of 20 sccm. The precursor dosing sequence was as follows: DEZ (0.1\u00a0s)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2 (10\u00a0s)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0H2O2 (0.1\u00a0s)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2 (10\u00a0s). Meanwhile, the substrate temperature was kept at 80\u00a0\u00b0C, which favors the preparation of ZnO thin film with low Vo defect concentration according to previous work [33,34]. The ZnO film thickness was varied by using different ALD cycles, namely, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, and 1600 cycles; the corresponding samples obtained were labeled as ZnO-100, ZnO-200, ZnO-400, ZnO-800, ZnO-1200, and ZnO-1600, respectively. All these sample films were deposited on both liquid crystal display (LCD) glass (Fusion 1737) and Si substrates so as to measure their various properties. The crystal structure of the fabricated ZnO films was characterized by using an XRD diffractometer (D/MAX-2000, Rigaku) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00.154\u00a0nm). We also performed grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXD) analysis at the 9A beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Republic of Korea). The surface morphology. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of the samples was investigated with a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) system (JEOL, JSM 7001F); the film thickness was measured via both FESEM and ellipsometry (L117 C, Gaertner Scientific Corporation) with a laser of 632.8\u00a0nm. The RMS surface roughness was studied by using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) device (XE-100). The PL analysis was carried out with a LabRam Aramis spectrometer (Horriba Jovin Yvon) using a 325\u00a0nm laser source at room temperature; the optical transmittance spectra were recorded by an ultraviolet (UV)\u2013visible\u2013near infrared spectrophotometer (V-750, JASCO) in the 200\u20131000\u00a0nm wavelength range. The resistivity (\u03c1), carrier mobility (\u03bc), and carrier concentration (n) of the ZnO films were measured according to the van der Pauw method (This method uses a four-point probe placed on the perimeter of the sample. It can provide an average resistivity of the sample and a linear array provides the resistivity in the sensing direction) by using a Hall effect measurement system (Ecopia HMS3000) at room temperature under a magnetic field of 0.57\u00a0T.  First, the thickness and growth per cycle (GPC) of the various ZnO films was investigated (Fig. 1 ); the increased thickness with increasing ALD cycles was in good agreement with the ALD mechanism, which grows a uniform atomic layer per cycle [35]. The GPC almost stays the same in crystalline samples (as shown in Fig. 2 ) ZnO-400, ZnO-800, ZnO-1200, and ZnO-1600. The decreased GPC value with the increase in ALD cycles agrees with the reported work about ALD prepared aluminum oxide, [37] and it can be explained by the simultaneous formation of Si-based oxide in the first few ALD cycles (due to the use of a Si substrate) as ZnO film was formed, which results in the measured GPC value in the first few ALD cycles being bigger than the actual GPC of ZnO film [37]. With the increase in ALD cycles, the proportion of Si-based oxide decreases and results in the decrease in GPC to a value close to the actual GPC of ALD prepared ZnO film. Fig. 2 displays the XRD patterns of the samples, showing no diffraction peak was observed for the ZnO-100 and ZnO-200 samples. A negligible (0 0 2) plane diffraction peak was observed at 34.198\u00b0 in the spectrum of the ZnO-400 sample but its intensity increased with the ALD cycles. To investigate the effect of the ALD cycles (i.e., of the film thickness) on the film crystallinity, we calculated the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of this peak for the ZnO-400\u2013ZnO-1600 samples (inset (a) of Fig. 2). Its value sharply decreased (around 2.5 times) from ZnO-400 to ZnO-800, revealing a weak crystallinity of the former sample and its obvious improvement for the latter. When further increasing the ALD cycles over 800, the FWHM value showed a moderate reduction, indicating a slight and continual increase in the film crystallinity. Similar phenomenon of the increased crystallinity with the increased ALD cycles also was observed in ALD prepared ZnO using H2O [38,39]. A better understanding of the ZnO growth mechanism was enabled by the GIWAXD analysis. This is because the information depth in a GIWAXD analysis depth matches the thickness of ZnO films, and it can detect the growth orientation of ultra-thin films better than any other diffraction tool. To determine the two-dimensional (2D) intensity distributions for the various samples, we plotted the in-plane (horizontal) and out-of-plane (vertical) components of the scattering vectors qz and qy along the vertical and horizontal axis, respectively (Fig. 3 (a\u2013f)). Then, the one-dimensional (1D) scattering patterns (Fig. 3(g\u2013l)) were taken along the in-plane, out-of-plane, and 45\u00b0 directions, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 3 (e). Both the 2D and 1D GIWAXD patterns showed a weak (0 0 2) plane diffraction signal for the ZnO-100 and ZnO-200 samples, suggesting that the ZnO thin film growth mechanism was the (0 0 2) preferred growth orientation even in these ultra-thin films. For greater film thicknesses, the (0 0 2) plane diffraction intensity clearly increased and a (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) diffraction signal also emerged in the in-plane directions, a consequence of the dominant (0 0 2) crystal orientation (Fig. 3(c\u2013f, i\u2013l)). The ZnO growth mechanism revealed by the GIWAXD analysis agrees well with the XRD results ((0 0 2) preferred growth orientation and increased film crystallinity with the increase in ALD cycles). This was also confirmed by the FESEM observation (Fig. 4 ), a more evident columnar-like structure perpendicular to the substrate (i.e., along the (0 0 2) growth orientation) was observed when increasing the ALD cycles (i.e., the film thickness). Our XRD results of totally (0 0 2) growth orientation of ZnO films, which is independent of the film thickness, differ from previous results about the ZnO films prepared via ALD by using H2O as the oxygen source [15,38]. As shown in Table 1, Singh et al. reported a variation in the preferred growth orientation of the ZnO films from (0 0 2) to (1 0 0), along with the emergence of some sub-diffraction peaks, as the ALD cycles increased from 200 to 1000 [15]. Both Kang et al. and Choi et al. observed the coexistence between the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), and (1 0 1) growth orientations in ZnO films fabricated through various ALD cycles on Si substrates when using H2O as the oxygen source (as shown in Table 1) [38,39]. In the present work, the use of H2O2 instead of H2O as the ALD oxygen source can provide an oxygen-rich environment for the ZnO growth that [33,34,40], in turn, can result in the totally (0 0 2) preferred growth orientation. It agrees well with previous results that the preferred growth orientation of ALD prepared ZnO transforms from only the (1 0 0) plane with only a water-pulse as the oxygen source into only the (0 0 2) plane with the pulse of oxygen after the water-pulse [40]. Fig. 4 shows the AFM images of the various ZnO films prepared. The derived RMS surface roughness values. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of the ZnO-100 and ZnO-200 samples were, respectively 0.34 and 0.40\u00a0nm; they were very close to each other and smaller than the others, probably due to the weak film crystallinity. From 400 to 1600 ALD cycles, the RMS surface roughness increased gradually from 0.58 to 1.59\u00a0nm. This trend can be attributed to the increased film crystallinity. Moreover, the AFM images confirmed the improved columnar-like structure grain as a result of the increased film thickness, consistently with the XRD, GIWAXD, and SEM results. Table 1 also compares the thickness effect on the RMS surface roughness for ZnO films prepared via ALD (with H2O2 as the O precursor) and other methods. ZnO films with the coexistence of (1 0 0), (0 0 2), and (1 0 1) growth orientations generally exhibited a relatively large surface roughness due to their non-uniform surface morphology [16,17]. The small surface roughness value observed for our samples can be attributed to both the uniformly (0 0 2) film growth orientation and the advantage of ALD method which favors the preparation of uniform films. The grain size of the ZnO-400\u2013ZnO-1600 samples was derived from the (0 0 2) diffraction peak by using the Scherrer equation; the results (Fig. 5 (a)) revealed that it increased along with the ALD cycles. It can be attributed to the increased crystallinity (as shown in Figs. 2 and 3) with the increased thickness and the decreased Vo defect concentration (as shown in section 3.3). The lattice parameter of the c-axis (perpendicular to the substrate) and the strain along the same direction were also calculated by using, respectively, the XRD data and the following strain equation: strain (%) = (c\u2013c0)/c0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100, where c is the lattice parameter of the c-axis as calculated for each sample and c0 is the one of unstrained ZnO (0.5206\u00a0nm) [41]. As shown in Fig. 5 (b), both the c-axis lattice parameter and strain sharply decreased when increasing the ALD cycles from 400 to 800, moderately decreased with a further increase to 1200 ALD cycles, and remained almost unchanged up to 1600 ALD cycles. The lattice parameter of c-axis in sample ZnO-1200 and ZnO-1600 was close to the bulk value (0.5206\u00a0nm) with almost no strain and this corresponds to the good film crystallinity in these samples. The previous studies on ZnO films prepared via ALD by using H2O have reported a similar relation between lattice strain and film thickness but, the analyzed samples exhibited more than one XRD peak and their preferred growth orientation changed dependent on the film thickness [15]. Moreover, the ALD prepared ZnO with the similar condition in present study but with a different oxygen source (H2O) in the author\u2019s group also showed various growth orientations and dependency on film thickness [38,39]. Therefore, our present results indicate that increasing the thickness of ZnO films prepared via ALD with H2O2 can increase their crystallinity and grain size, decrease the c-axis lattice parameter, and release the c-axis tensile strain, with no change in the preferred growth orientation, which remains (0 0 2). This can be explained by the oxygen-rich condition provided by H2O2 for the ZnO film growth, which favors the thermodynamically preferred growth orientation along the (0 0 2) plane with the lowest surface energy [34,40]. To investigate the thickness effect on the intrinsic oxygen vacancy of ZnO thin films, we recorded the PL spectra of all the samples in the 325\u2013700\u00a0nm range in Fig. 6 . We observed two main signals: a peak at around 370\u00a0nm, attributable to the ultraviolet near-band-edge emission (UV-NBE-emission), and a broad band at around 560\u00a0nm, probably related to the oxygen vacancy defects (Vo-emission) in the ZnO films [33,34,43\u201345]. As the thin film became thicker, the intensity of both the UV-NBE- (from 100 to 1600 ALD cycles) and Vo-emission (from 100 to 1200 ALD cycles) increased. Previous studies have reported that the crystal quality and thickness of ZnO films can influence the PL emission peak intensity and have used the ratio between defect emission and UV-NBE-emission peak intensities to evaluate the defect concentration in samples with different thickness and crystal quality [15,19,26,46]. Therefore, due to the thickness and crystallinity increase resulting from the increase of the ALD cycles, we also calculated the ratio between the Vo- and UV-NBE-emission peak intensities (IVo and IUV, respectively) as a function of the ALD cycles (inset of Fig. 6) for a better understanding of the thickness effect on Vo defect concentration. The intensity of IVo and IUV may be proportional to the Vo defect numbers and near band edge emission intensity (material\u2019s volume), respectively. The IVo/IUV value decreased when increasing the ALD cycles, which indicates a relative Vo defect concentration decrease for thicker ZnO films; in fact, if the Vo defect concentration would have not decreased with the film thickness increase, the IVo/IUV value should have not changed. This variation can be explained by the increased crystallinity and decreased grain boundaries resulting from the grain size increase along with the film thickness, which can decrease the Vo defect (easily formed at the grain boundaries) concentration. It agrees with the previous works reporting a Vo defect concentration decrease in ZnO films when increasing the crystallinity [18,19,26]. Therefore, compared with other methods (Table 1), especially ALD based on H2O, the preparation of ZnO films via ALD by using H2O2 as the oxygen precursor has the advantages of totally c-axis (0 0 2) growth orientation, low RMS surface roughness, and passivated oxygen vacancy. The optical transmittance of each sample was measured in the 200\u20131000\u00a0nm range (Fig. 7 (a)); the average values within the visible light range (380\u2013780\u00a0nm) of LCD glass, ZnO-100, ZnO-200, ZnO-400, ZnO-800, ZnO-1200, and ZnO-1600 were 91.9% \u00b1 0.3%, 90.6% \u00b1 0.3%, 88.8% \u00b1 0.3%, 85.2% \u00b1 0.3%, 79.0% \u00b1 0.3%, 77.7% \u00b1 0.3%, and 79.4% \u00b1 0.3%, respectively. The ZnO-100 transmittance was very close to the uncoated LCD glass, probably due to its ultrathin film thickness. The decrease in the ZnO film transmittance when increasing the ALD cycles from 100 to 800 can be attributed to the correspondingly. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "increased film thickness. The transmittance values of ZnO-800, ZnO-1200, and ZnO-1600 were very close (but the shape does change considerably), which indicates that the film thickness has almost no effect on the average transmittance value in their thickness range in the case of good crystallinity. Fig. 7 (b) shows the optical bandgap of each sample calculated via the Tauc relation, which plots (\u03b1\u0570\u03bd)2 vs \u0570\u03bd (where \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient of the ZnO films on the LCD glass, h is the Planck constant, and \u03bd is the frequency of light) and extrapolates the fit of the linear region to \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00. The \u03b1 value was calculated as follows [47]: \u03b1=-1tlnTr where t and Tr are the film thickness and transmittance, respectively. The optical bandgaps of ZnO-100, ZnO-200, ZnO-400, ZnO-800, ZnO-1200, and ZnO-1600 were 3.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, 3.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, 3.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, 3.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, 3.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, and 3.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0eV, respectively. This reduction in the optical bandgap when increasing the ALD cycles might be due to the redshift of the absorption edge as a result of the increased crystallinity and released compression strain [47]. The interatomic spacing in the highly crystalline samples was relatively smaller than that of weak crystalline samples, as suggested by Fig. 5(b), this reduction in interatomic spacing can increase the conduction and valance bandwidth, resulting in a decreased optical bandgap in the highly crystalline samples [15,47]. Moreover, the decreased Vo defect concentration can result in the reverse Burstein\u2013Moss effect, which can reduce the Fermi level and optical bandgap [33,48,49]. The carrier concentration, Hall mobility, and resistivity are shown in Fig. 8 . With the increase in the ALD cycles, the film carrier concentration decreased; this might be attributed to the higher crystallinity and grain size (decreased grain boundaries) in the thicker samples, which can decrease the concentration of Vo defects (sources of free carriers that are easily formed at the grain boundaries) and, consequently, that of carriers. This outcome agrees with the PL results shown in Fig. 6, which suggested a Vo defect concentration reduction when increasing the ALD cycles and a film quality improvement. Our findings are also consistent with previous studies on ZnO films fabricated via sputtering and PLD method, which have reported improved film quality and decreased defect (such as Vo) and carrier concentrations with the increase in film thickness [18,19,26]. However, our results differ from those of Singh et. al; they prepared ZnO films via ALD by using DEZ and H2O as the precursors and observed an increase in both carrier and defect (such as Vo) concentrations when increasing the film thickness [15]. This can be attributed to the difference between H2O and H2O2 since the latter can provide more oxygen atoms for the ZnO film growth, which can passivate Vo defects [33,34]. The enhanced Hall mobility resulting from the ALD cycle increase can be attributed to the decrease in grain boundaries and Vo defect concentration because an oxygen vacancy is a charged point defect in the ZnO atomic lattice that can serve as a scattering center for the carriers and, therefore, a reduction in the concentration of such defects can promote the carrier mobility in the ZnO film. Moreover, the decrease in grain boundaries can further suppress the carrier scattering and increase Hall mobility. Both the carrier concentration and Hall mobility variations can lead to a change in resistivity. Fig. 8 shows the film resistivity raised when increasing the ALD cycles from 100 to 1200; this resulted from a huge carrier concentration reduction in the corresponding samples, while the respective Hall mobility exhibited only a moderate increment. When the ALD cycles were further increased from 1200 to 1600, only a slight change of carrier concentration, Hall mobility, and resistivity were observed. This relation between resistivity and film thickness differs from that reported for ZnO films prepared via ALD by using H2O, namely, a resistivity decrease with the film thickness increase [15]; such a different trend is observed because a thickness increase in ZnO films prepared with H2O can increase in defect (such as Vo) and carrier concentrations and, thus, decrease the resistivity.  We investigated the thickness effect on the properties of ALD-prepared ZnO film that used H2O2 as the oxygen precursor that showed passivated oxygen vacancies and total c-axis growth. The results of this totally c-axis growth, independent on the film thickness and confirmed by the XRD and GIWAXD analyses, differed from those previously reported about other ALD-prepared ZnO films, which have shown a variation in the preferred growth orientation depending on film thickness. The difference is attributed to previous studies using H2O instead of H2O2 as the oxygen precursor. Increasing the film thickness gradually improved the crystallinity and grain size, releasing the c-axis tensile strain, decreasing the c-axis lattice parameter, and increasing the RMS surface roughness. The resulting higher crystallinity and grain size (and reduced grain boundaries), in turn, further decreases the n-type intrinsic defects, i.e., the oxygen vacancies, in the ZnO films and, as a consequence, the carrier concentration decreased as film thickness increased. Reducing Vo defect concentration and grain boundaries suppresses the carrier scattering and increases the carrier mobility. The increased resistivity was observed with the increased film thickness due to the decrease in carrier concentration. The increase in film thickness resulted also in optical bandgap shrinking, which can be attributed to the increased crystallinity and released c-axis tensile strain. Both the film transmittance and optical bandgap decreased with the increase in film thickness.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Especially for TiO2, since Fujishima and Honda discovered the phenomenon of water splitting in 1972 , a number of researches have been carried out for TiO2 photocatalyst, because the TiO2 crystals can serve for environmental pollution in the direction of degrading pollutant, toxic, etc. At present, the TiO2 crystals have been considered as the most suitable photocatalyst owing to its chemical stability, low cost, long-term stability and non-toxic. However, it can only use about 4% of solar spectrum in the UV region because of its wide band gap (about 3.20 eV for anatase and 3.00 eV for rutile) . So various strategies have been going on to improve the photoelectric performance of TiO2, such as tuning crystal size, crystalline and structure , doping metal or nonmetal elements , loading metal nanoparticles , sensitizing with other narrow band gap semiconductors , synthesizing heterojunctions . The semiconductor of p\u2013n heterojunction, such as Ag2O/TiO2 , Cu2O/BiVO4 , CuBi2O4/TiO2 , NiO/TiO2 , is an effective strategy to improve the charge carrier's separation and collection efficiency. Several advantages can be achieved by adopting p\u2013n junction: (1) more effective charge separation; (2) rapid charge transfer to the catalyst; (3) longer lifetime of the charge carriers; (4) separation of locally incompatible reduction and oxidation reactions in nanospace . These features endow the p\u2013n heterojunction semiconductor photocatalyst an enhanced photocatalytic activity. Recently, well oriented TiO2 nanorod-array has captured much more attention because of its good charge transport property due to its particular microstructure. It can offer direct electrical pathways for photogenerated carriers, shorten diffusion distance and then increase the electron transport rate , has been applied in quite a few fields. On the other hand, CuCrO2, one kind of p-type delafossite ternary oxides, inherits the structures with CrO6 octahedra and Cu planes, forming O Cu O dumbbell bond with Cu, O along c-axis and exhibits p-type conductivity. Due to its excellent optical transmittance, low valence band energy position and fast hole diffusion coefficient, it has attracted much more researcher's attention on transparent conducting oxide, solar cells, catalyst and so on . As mentioned above, we developed a novel p\u2013n heterostructure photocatalyst, which is consisting of CuCrO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorods. The enhanced photocatalytic performance (for degrading methylene blue) of CuCrO2/TiO2 also confirmed the advantage of p\u2013n heterojunction photocatalyst as mentioned before. In this work, we successfully prepared a series of CuCrO2/TiO2 through simple spin-coating method, by employing CuCrO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorod-array film. With the help of XRD, SEM/EDS, TEM/EDS, XPS, photocurrent response measurements, we studied the effects of synthesis conditions on the morphology and composition of CuCrO2/TiO2. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance was evaluated by degrading methylene blue (MB), a model pollutant, under UV irradiation. Finally, we also proposed the photocatalytic mechanism of CuCrO2/TiO2 with p\u2013n heterostructure. To our knowledge, this is the first report to synthesize CuCrO2/TiO2 heterostructure photocatalyst and obtain an enhanced photocatalytic performance.  All chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. Both TiO2 nanorod-array film and CuCrO2 nanoparticles were synthesized through facile hydrothermal synthesis method. Firstly, the TiO2 nanorod-array film was synthesized according to the literature . Typically, 30 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5\u201338% by weight), 5 ml saturated sodium chloride solution and 25 ml water was mixed with continuous stirring, followed by the addition of 1 ml titanium butoxide. After stirring to a dispersed dissolution, a cleanly 3 \u00d7 5 cm2 FTO glass (F:SnO2, NSG company) substrate was put in with the conducting side facing down. The hydrothermal condition was controlled at 150 \u00b0C for 10 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. When the hydrothermal reaction finished, the autoclave was cooled by flowing water for 20 min and the FTO substrate was rinsed by deionized water and ultrasonic cleaning slightly. Secondly, the CuCrO2 nanoparticles were also synthesized according to our previous work . Typically, 15 mmol Cr(NO3)3\u00b79H2O and 15 mmol Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O were dissolved in 70 ml water followed by adding 5.0 g NaOH with magnetic stirring. The solution was maintained at 220\u223c240 \u00b0C for 60 h in a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave. When the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the obtained product was washed with diluted hydrochloric acid and alcohol for several times in a centrifugal cleaning machine. Finally, CuCrO2/TiO2 was fabricated by employing a simple spin-coating method. A certain amount of CuCrO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed in pure alcohol with magnetic stirring for 24 h, which is for further use in spin-coating experiments. When we coated the CuCrO2 nanoparticles onto a FTO substrate (which was deposited with the TiO2 nanorod-array film), the volume of CuCrO2 suspension remain unchanged every time. We got a series of CuCrO2/TiO2 with different loading amount of CuCrO2 by adjusting the suspension concentration (0.25\u20131.00 gL\u22121) and the number of spin time (5\u201315). After the composite films were sintered at 300 \u00b0C for 1 h in air, the CuCrO2/TiO2 photocatalyst can be achieved successfully. X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Cu K\u03b1 radiation) was used to examine the crystal phase of as-obtained samples. The morphology and composition were observed with field emission scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (FESEM/EDS, Ultra Plus-43-13), transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM/EDS, Tecnai G2 20). The surface chemical status was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Multilab 2000). The photocurrent was measured by an electrochemical analyzer (760E, Shanghai) in a standard three-electrode system under irradiation of UV light with Na2SO4 aqueous (0.1 mol L\u22121) as the electrolyte. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by adopting methylene blue (MB) as a model pollutant under the illumination of ultraviolet tubes (purchased from Philips) with the intensity of 1.2 mW cm\u22122. The MB aqueous solution with initial concentration of 5 \u03bcmol L\u22121 in the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "presence of film photocatalyst was filled in a quartz container, and the temperature of reaction solution was maintained at approximately 25 \u00b0C. Prior to irradiation, the solution with photocatalyst was placed in the dark for 1 h to establish the adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. The degradation of MB aqueous solution was monitored by UV\u2013vis spectrometer (UV-1601, Shimadzu) at \u03bb = 664 nm at certain reaction intervals, the detailed experimental method was according to our previous works .  In this work, we first prepared CuCrO2/TiO2 through simple spin-coating method, the crystal phase and structure, morphology and chemical composition of CuCrO2/TiO2 were examined by XRD, SEM/EDS, TEM/EDS, XPS measurements. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of CuCrO2/TiO2 was evaluated by degrading methylene blue (MB) under UV irradiation. Finally, we characterized the photocurrent and discussed the photocatalytic mechanism of CuCrO2/TiO2. Detailed experimental conditions and photocatalytic activities are listed in Table 1 . The crystal structures of bare TiO2 nanorod-array film as well as CuCrO2/TiO2 were revealed by XRD (Fig. 1 ) analysis. The curve (a) in Fig. 1 revealed that all the diffraction peaks could be assigned to tetragonal rutile phase TiO2 (P42/mnm, JCPDS No. 21-1276) and tetragonal SnO2 (P42/mnm, JCPDS No. 46-1088), no impurity phase could be detected. The main peaks at 2\u03b8 = 54.3\u00b0, 62.7\u00b0 could be indexed to the (2 1 1), (0 0 2) crystal planes of TiO2, because the TiO2 nanorod-array film oriented growth with (0 0 2) direction in this work. Besides the diffraction peaks of TiO2 and SnO2 on curve (b), the additional diffraction peak around 31.4 \u00b0could be identified as CuCrO2 (R-3m, JCPDS No. 39-0247), which is corresponding to the (0 0 6) crystal planes of hexagonal CuCrO2 . Furthermore, the intensity of characteristic peak is weakly which can be attributed to the small amount of CuCrO2 nanoparticles in CuCrO2/TiO2. Fig. 2 shows the typical field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of TiO2 nanorod-array film and CuCrO2/TiO2. Top and cross-sectional views of pure TiO2 nanorod-array film are shown in Fig. 2a, the average diameter and length for TiO2 nanorods are around 90 nm and 1.8 \u03bcm, respectively. Fig. 2b\u2013d presents SEM images of CuCrO2/TiO2, which were prepared from different concentrations of CuCrO2 nanoparticles suspension solution, are corresponding to 0.25 g L\u22121, 0.50 g L\u22121 and 1.00 g L\u22121, respectively. The insets with high magnification in these SEM images show that CuCrO2 nanoparticles with the size around 20 nm located on the surface and top of TiO2 nanorods. Compared to the SEM images in Fig. 2b and d, it could be seen that more CuCrO2 nanoparticles were coated on the surface and top of TiO2 nanorods while a higher CuCrO2 concentration, maybe due to the higher concentration caused more amounts of CuCrO2 nanoparticles were loaded in dispersed suspension. Moreover, the chemical composition and element distribution information of the CuCrO2/TiO2 were analyzed by SEM-EDS mapping scan, the results are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be observed that all of the elements distributions of Ti and O, Cu and Cr are similar, the mapping of Ti and O in Fig. 3a and b show several irregular dim areas, which indicates that there were less TiO2 nanorods in these areas. Because the morphology of TiO2 nanorod-array film is not a dense and uniform films, there be much space or gap exist between these nanorods. Moreover, the morphology of TiO2 nanorod-array film is shown in Fig. 3d, which is consistent with the EDS mapping results of Ti and O. Furthermore, Fig. 3c and d shows the Cu and Cr elements homogeneous distribution with lots of pore spaces. The mapping results for Cu and Cr show clearly images with a large number of voids in comparison to that of Ti and O, may be due to the small amount CuCrO2 nanoparticles were loaded on the surface of TiO2 nanorods. Moreover, Fig. 3f shows the element percentages of Cu (0.21 at.%), Cr (0.19 at.%) nearly match well with the stoichiometric proportion of CuCrO2 (1.11: 1). In order to study the detailed microstructure of CuCrO2/TiO2, TEM and HRTEM observations were carried out to examine the morphology of sample E, as shown in Fig. 4 . The low-magnification TEM image of the CuCrO2/TiO2 is displayed in Fig. 4a. It is clearly showed that the composites display heterostructures, and the composite are composed of CuCrO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorods. This TEM image also revealed that the crystal size of CuCrO2 nanoparticles around 20 nm and the diameter of TiO2 nanorod about 100 nm, coinciding with the results from the FESEM observations in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, Fig. 4b and c shows the high-resolution image from the connection section of CuCrO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorods. It revealed more detailed structural characteristics of the heterostructures, and we could see the junction displayed two types of clear lattice fringes. More specifically, the interplanar spacings were ca. 0.247 nm and 0.285 nm, which corresponding to the (0 1 2) and (0 0 6) planes of delafossite CuCrO2 nanoparticles, respectively. Besides, another interplanar spacing was ca. 0.325 nm, corresponding to the (1 1 0) planes of rutile TiO2 nanorods. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (at the top right of Fig. 4b) from CuCrO2/TiO2 clearly demonstrated the single crystal nature of the CuCrO2. What's more, the distinguished interplanar spacings and continuity of the lattice fringes at the interface (in black dash circle) between CuCrO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorods may suggest the formation of p\u2013n heterojunction . Moreover, the EDS analysis results are shown in the right bottom of Fig. 4b, the EDS data also confirmed that the CuCrO2/TiO2 is composed of Ti, O, Cu, Cr elements, suggesting the existence of CuCrO2 and TiO2. Furthermore, the element chemical states of the CuCrO2/TiO2 (sample E) were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5 , the full-scale XPS spectrum shows only the Ti, O, Cu, Cr and C existed at the surfaces (Fig. 5a), indicating the formation of multi-phase oxide as CuCrO2 and TiO2. There were two. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "peaks located at 458.4 eV and 464.1 eV in Fig. 5b, which could be attributed to the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, the characteristic peaks of Ti4+ in TiO2 . In addition, Fig. 5c shows that the peaks located at approximately 931.3 eV and 951.2 eV are corresponding to the binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, could confirmed the monovalent state of copper in the samples. The peaks close to 575.9 eV and 585.8 eV (Fig. 5d) are corresponding to the binding energies of Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2, which confirm the trivalent state of chromium (Cr3+) . The XPS data also confirmed the existence of CuCrO2 and TiO2 in the composite once again. The photocatalytic performance of TiO2 and CuCrO2/TiO2 were carried out by degrading MB aqueous solution under UV irradiation. For a better comparison, we analyzed the kinetic linear simulation of degradation of MB, which following the pseudo-first-order kinetics model due to the low initial MB concentration. The equation is described as : r=dC/dt=kKC/(1+kC) where r is degradation rate of reactant (mg L\u22121 h\u22121), C is the concentration of reactant (mg L\u22121) and t is irradiation time. When the initial concentration is very low, the equation can be simplified to an apparent first-order model : ln(C0/C)=kKt=Kappt where C 0 is the concentration of MB after the adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium, Kapp is the apparent first-order rate constant (h\u22121). The calculated degradation efficiency and apparent first-order rate constant are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1, respectively. It can be seen that both the degradation efficiency and apparent first-order rate constant of CuCrO2/TiO2 were enhanced in comparison to that of pure TiO2. The addition of CuCrO2 nanoparticles plays an important role in the degradation process, so we loaded different amount of CuCrO2 nanoparticles by adjusting the CuCrO2 suspension concentration (0.25\u20131.00 g L\u22121) and the number of spin times (5\u201315) in these experiments. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and b, the sample B which was loaded with 0.50 g L\u22121 CuCrO2 suspension owned the best photocatalytic activity, and the calculated degradation efficiency was 85.3%, about 1.14 times than pure TiO2 (74.6%). The degradation efficiency increased from 74.6% to 85.3% with increasing of CuCrO2 suspension concentration from 0 to 0.50 g L\u22121, the enhanced degradation efficiency could be contributed to the formation of p\u2013n heterojunctions between CuCrO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorods constructed by spin-coating method. The higher photocatalytic activity could be achieved while there be more p\u2013n heterojunction formed and served during the photocatalytic process. However, the degradation efficiency of CuCrO2/TiO2 decreased from 85.3% to 81.1% with increasing the CuCrO2 suspension concentration from 0.50 g L\u22121 to 1.0 g L\u22121. This issue could be due to CuCrO2 suspension concentration is too high, leading to more and more CuCrO2 nanoparticles were coated on the surface of TiO2 nanorods, which resulting in the agglomeration of nanoparticles and increase the recombination chance of electron\u2013hole pairs. On the other side, if there are too much CuCrO2 nanoparticles coated on the surface of TiO2 nanorods, it could fade the absorption of TiO2 nanorods and cause a weakly photocatalytic activity. For the same reasons, the degradation efficiency of CuCrO2/TiO2 decreased from 85.3% to 81.0% with increasing the spin times from 5 to 15, as shown in Fig. 6b. The change trends of apparent first-order rate constant of CuCrO2/TiO2 was similar to that of degradation efficiency, which are shown in Fig. 6c and d. The calculated rate constant of sample B (0.236) was the highest, about 1.39 times higher than pure TiO2 (0.170). To further understanding the heterojunction structure effect to enhanced photocatalytic activity, we carefully investigated transient photocurrent responses of TiO2 and CuCrO2/TiO2. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of TiO2 and CuCrO2/TiO2 photocurrent responses under several on/off UV light irradiation cycles. It can be seen that the photocurrent increased rapidly when the light is on and decay to a constant value later, while it decreased to zero if the light was turned off immediately. In fact, the photocurrent generated by the separation of electron\u2013hole pairs at the interface of semiconductor/electrolyte: holes are trapped or captured by reduced species in the electrolyte, while electrons were transported to the substrate via TiO2 nanorod-arrays . As a result, CuCrO2/TiO2 owns a higher current than TiO2 within several on/off cycles, which demonstrated that the photogenerated electrons and holes prefer to separate and transfer to surface , owing to the p\u2013n heterojunction in CuCrO2/TiO2, resulting in an improved separation efficiency of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. Generally, the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors mainly depends on the separation of excited electron\u2013hole pairs . The excited electron\u2013hole pairs should be captured much more than recombined, thus the electrons and holes can improve photocatalytic activity rather than give off heat by recombination . By employing p\u2013n heterojunction structure, the separation efficiency of photoexcited electron\u2013hole pairs could be increased by an inner field. Based on the above experimental results, the enhanced activity could be owing to p\u2013n heterojunctions between CuCrO2 and TiO2, and the proposed schematic diagram of CuCrO2/TiO2 was elucidated in Fig. 8 . Before the p-type CuCrO2 contact to the n-type TiO2, the Fermi level of CuCrO2 is lower than that of TiO2. When the two type crystals combined together, the electrons transfer from TiO2 side to CuCrO2 side due to the carrier concentration gradient until their Fermi levels align, which result in the electrons diffuse from TiO2 to CuCrO2 and holes diffuse through the opposite direction. Meanwhile, the Fermi level of CuCrO2 was moved up and that of TiO2 was moved down at the same time. As a result, the whole energy band position of CuCrO2 was raised while TiO2 was lowered, which could enlarge the spacing of conduction band position (CB) and valence band position (VB) between CuCrO2 and TiO2. Thus, as mentioned above, the p\u2013n heterojunction was formed finally. Furthermore, the CuCrO2 part possesses negative charges and the TiO2 part possesses positive charges near to the heterojunction regions, which could form an opposing inner electric field. When the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "p\u2013n heterojunction was irradiated by the UV light with the photoenergy equal to or higher than the band gap energy, both CuCrO2 and TiO2 were excited to generate electron\u2013hole pairs. The electrons on the CB of CuCrO2 would flow to the lower CB of TiO2 and the holes could flow from TiO2 to CuCrO2, which were driven by the inner electric field, so the CuCrO2 act as a hole traps and collector . Finally, the electron\u2013hole pairs were separated more effectively through this way, and then the electrons and holes could react with the absorption (i.e. O2, H2O), producing superoxide radical anions (such as O2\u2212, OOH, OH, OH\u2212) species to take part in the photocatalytic process and to degrade the MB dye, and then the enhanced photocatalytic activity by p\u2013n heterojunction could be achieved easily.  In conclusion, by using hydrothermal synthesis and spin-coating method, the p-type CuCrO2/n-type TiO2 heterojunction nanorod-array film with different amount of CuCrO2 nanoparticles were successfully fabricated. Crystal phase, morphology, chemical composition and photocurrent response of CuCrO2/TiO2 were examined by various measurements. These results indicated that the p\u2013n heterostructure was formed between CuCrO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorods in CuCrO2/TiO2 composites. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of CuCrO2/TiO2 was evaluated by degrading MB under UV irradiation. Both the degradation efficiency and apparent first-order rate constant of CuCrO2/TiO2 were enhanced in comparison to pure TiO2. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to a better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs, which caused by the formation of p\u2013n heterojunctions in CuCrO2/TiO2. Finally, the proposed photocatalytic mechanism of CuCrO2/TiO2 was discussed for the first time. More importantly, the method presented here may be extended to synthesize other ternary p-type delafossite oxides as well as TiO2 heterostructures for various applications, and our researches are in progress to address such feasibilities.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Therefore, the research and development of high-power energy storage devices is considered to be one of the key elements in practical applications. Batteries have been used in many devices such as the hybrid electric vehicles and light-duty vehicles . However, the majority of vehicles require a higher storage and delivery than what can be obtained by batteries . Compared with batteries, electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also called supercapacitors (SCs) as an alternative or complement, owing to their technical benefits, special chemical/physical properties, and many remarkable electrochemical performances such as high power delivery/uptake (10 KW kg\u22121), excellent cycle stability (over 1 \u00d7 105 cycles), high theoretical specific capacitance, fast full charge/discharge rates and environmental compatibility, are definitely ready for a wide range of researches and applications in solar cell panels, mobile electronic and memory backup devices . Two categories of SCs exist based on the mechanism of energy storage: the electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and the faradic pseudocapacitors (FPCs). Based on high-surface-area carbon electrodes, the EDLCs can store charge by the electrostatic attraction at the interface between electrode and electrolyte . The FPCs based on transition metal oxides, transition metal hydroxides, and conducting polymers as the electrode materials set up by the fast and reversible redox reactions occurring on the surface of the active electrode materials . Compared to the EDLCs, FPCs can provide relatively larger specific capacitance and energy densities because of the different energy storage mechanisms . However, the numerous applications is still restricted by the low energy density of SCs (5\u201310 Wh kg\u22121) . In order to meet the demand, the energy density (E) can be improved though the increase of cell operating voltage (V) and/or cell specific capacitance (C) according to the following calculation formula: E = CV/2 . Fortunately, with the development of the research and application of supercapacitors, the advanced asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) based on the capacitor-type electrode as the power source and battery-type Faradic electrode as the energy source can provide a wider potential windows (\u223c2 V) and higher energy/power density than the symmetric supercapacitors according to the synergistic effects of the two electrodes, which provide a promising way to meet the needs of practical applications . Furthermore, to obtain a relatively high-performance electrodes, providing a suitable electrode material for an electrochemical device is a key factor. The electrode materials can be divided into three types: carbon-based materials, metal compounds (such as oxide, sulfide, hydroxide, and selenide) and conducting polymers . Among the various electrode materials, the transition-metal sulfides (CoSx, NiSx, CuS, CuCo2S4, NiCoSx), have been widely explored as one of the most important electrode materials due to their higher theoretical capacitance and multiple redox reactions, especially the mixing metal sulfides . For example, the NiCo2S4 nanotube array electrode demonstrates the areal capacitance of 2.86 F cm\u22122 at 4 mA cm\u22122 . NiCo2S4 nanotube electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 1093 F g\u22121 at a current density of 0.2 A g\u22121 . Additionally, Shengjie Peng and Linlin design the NiCo2S4-RGO hybrid electrode with the specific capacitance of 1161 F g\u22121 at 5 A g\u22121 . Despite the high capacitance of NiCo2S4 electrodes, the disadvantages still limit their practical applications such as complex synthesis process which involves multistep procedure, high temperature, high pressure, and long reaction time during the hydrothermal process. In this article, we present a facile and general route by a two-step hydrothermal synthesis approach to synthesize NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres which exhibit the outstanding electrochemical properties. Based on the total mass of active materials in negative and positive electrodes, this NiCo2S4/NiS//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor has a stable voltage window of 1.6 V, and also achieves a high energy density of 43.7 Wh kg\u22121. The combined effect of NiCo2S4/NiS can improve the surface roughness, enlarge the surface area, reduce resistance, and increase the electrochemical performances for the NiCo2S4/NiS electrode.  All chemicals were used directly without any purification. Urea and Na2S\u00b79H2O were obtained from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. CoCl2\u00b76H2O and NiCl2\u00b76H2O were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, India. 0.833 g (3.5 mmol) of NiCl2\u00b76H2O, 0.357 g of CoCl2\u00b76H2O (1.5 mmol),and 0.910 g (15 mmol) urea were dissolved in 70 mL of deionized water under stirring condition. Afterwards, the nickel foam (Ni foam) (1 \u00d7 1 cm\u22122) and the mixed solution were transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL). The precursor was achieved by hydrothermal reaction at 130 \u00b0C for 5 h. Subsequently, the as-prepared precursor was cooled to ambient temperature, rinsed several times with distilled water, and then fully dried at 60 \u00b0C for 5 h. 0.1 M of Na2S (80 mL) and the precursor/Ni foam were placed in a beaker, and heated at 60 \u00b0C for 5 h under continuous magnetic stirring, which was then transferred to the Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL). After maintaining at 140 \u00b0C for 5 h, the as-prepare samples were cooled to room temperature naturally, washed with distilled water by ultrasonication and then left at 60 \u00b0C for 5 h. The mass of NiCo2S4/NiS sample in each Ni foam was about 3 mg. The microstructures and morphologies of the NiCo2S4/NiS sample were investigated by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM2100, JEOL, Japan) and the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU8000, Hitachi, Japan, including the energy dispersive spectrometer analyses (EDS)). The compositions and crystal structures of the samples were explored by the X-ray diffraction (XRD, RigakuSmartLab Cu K\u03b1, \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The elemental composition of product was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB250Xi). The electrochemical properties of NiCo2S4/NiS supercapacitor were evaluated in three and two-electrode systems by measurement of electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, 0.01\u2013105 Hz), galvanostatic charge\u2212discharge (GCD), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua Co. Ltd, Shanghi) with a Hg/HgO electrode as the reference, a Pt as the counter, and the NiCo2S4/NiS sample as the working electrode. A long cycle life was carried out by applying a LAND. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "battery program-control test system (CT2001A, LANHE Co. Ltd, Wuhan). The whole electrochemical measurements were measured at room temperature in 3 M KOH alkaline electrolyte.  The typical synthetic procedure of the NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres electrode was illustrated in Fig. 1 . The sample was grown directly on Ni foam, which could make full use of space and enhance the dispersion of the samples, via a facile two-step hydrothermal route. The phase structure and purity of the NiCo2S4/NiS sample are analyzed by means of XRD, as shown in Fig. 2 a. The sample are obtained from the Ni foam by ultrasonic which can avoid the strong influence of Ni foam substrates. As for the hybrid composites, the major diffraction peaks located at 16.5\u00b0, 26.9\u00b0, 31.7\u00b0, 38.4\u00b0, 50.5\u00b0, and 55.3\u00b0 can be perfectly indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of NiCo2S4 (JCPDS, card no. 43-1477), and several peaks at 32.4\u00b0, 34.9\u00b0, 40.8\u00b0, 49.3\u00b0, and 52.9\u00b0 attributed to the reflections of the (300), (021), (211), (131), and (401) planes for NiS (JCPDS, card no.03-0760). Besides, the impurity peak at 19.4 is observed, which attributes to the precursor of (Ni, Co)2(CO3)(OH)2. Nevertheless, no other impurity peaks can be found which demonstrates the high purity of the sample. In order to further explore the as-prepared sample, the chemical compositions are also analyzed by EDS. Fig. 2b shows a typical EDS spectrum with the spectrum data analysis, and the sample is composed of Ni, Co, S, O, and C elements. The atomic ratio of Co, Ni, and S is 1:1.63:1.98, illustrating the existence of NiCo2S4 and NiS. In Fig. 2e\u2013f, the distribution of Co, Ni, and S elements in the detected region exhibited by the elemental mapping images manifests the co-existence of NiCo2S4/NiS furtherly. To further research the chemical state and elemental composition of the detected elements on the near surface, the as-prepare samples is characterized by XPS analysis and shown in Fig. 3 . By the Gaussian fitting method, the Co 2p spectrum is fitted with two shakeup satellites (Sat.), and two spin orbit doublets (Co 2p3/2: 778.67 eV, and Co 2p1/2: 798.17 eV) . The two peaks are separated by the energy difference of 19.5 eV confirming the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+ oxidation state in the sample . In addition, a similar situation is also observed in Fig. 3c, the spin-orbit splitting values of low energy band (Ni 2p3/2, 857.12 eV) and the high energy band (Ni 2p1/2, 874.97 eV) are over 15 eV which indicate the presence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ oxidation state . In Fig. 3d, the spectrum of S 2p shows a shakeup satellite, a 2P1/2 and a 2P3/2 peak at 169.27 eV, 162.87 eV, and 161.72 eV, respectively. Through the analysis of XPS patterns, the sample is composed of Co2+, Co3+, Ni2+, Ni3+, S2\u2212, C and O, which is consistent with the relevant literature information . The surface morphologies of samples are further investigated by FESEM. A low-magnification FESEM images in Fig. 4 a displays the pristine Ni foam with a smooth surface, and Fig. 4b, c indicate that the orderly NiCo2S4/NiS nanospheres are successfully grown on the skeleton of Ni foam after hydrothermal treatments. A high-magnification FESEM image in Fig. 4d exhibits the unique hollow nanospheres which can enhance the specific surface area, improve efficiency of utilization and provide abundant electroactive sites. At the same time, the microstructures and morphologies of the NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres are further investigated by TEM and HRTEM. In order to maintain the reliability of test results, the sample of TEM pictures is also scraped from the nickel foam. As shown in Fig. 4e, hollow nanospheres of NiCo2S4/NiS with the uneven surface is explicitly identified, which is in good agreement with the FESEM results. The HRTEM image displayed in Fig. 4f reveals several visible lattice fringes with the lattice spacings of 0.544 and 0.235 nm corresponding to the (400) and (111) theoretical interplanar planes of NiCo2O4. In addition, the inter-planar distances of 0.48 and 0.277 nm are consistent with the (110) and (300) planes of NiS, which correspond to the XRD investigation. All of the above test results illustrate that the NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres are successfully grown on nickel foam via a simple two-step hydrothermal process. In order to accurately estimate the electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres, the electrochemical measurements are processed by EIS, CV GCD, and cyclic stability measurements in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. In Fig. 5 a, the typical CV curves of the unique electrode are also investigated at the different scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s\u22121 in the range of \u22120.1 to 0.7 V. The CV curves show a pair of stronger redox peaks, indicating the obvious capacitance characteristics which are controlled by Faradaic redox reactions. As the scan rate decreases, closed areas of the typical CV curves are reductive, while the redox peaks are separated into two pairs of redox peaks. The redox reaction mechanism of NiCo2S4/NiS can be attributed to the redox reactions of Co2+/Co3+, Co3+/Co4+, and Ni2+/Ni3+ which are as follows : NiS: NiS + OH\u2212 \u2194 NiSOH + e\u2212 NiCo2S4: NiS + OH\u2212 \u2194 NiSOH + e\u2212 CoS + OH\u2212 \u2194 CoSOH + e\u2212 CoSOH + OH\u2212 \u2194 CoSO + H2O + e\u2212 Additionally, as the increase of the reversibility of redox reaction, the redox peaks shift to more negative and positive potential, respectively. To obtain the charge storage capacity, the GCD measurements are conducted with the potential window 0\u20130.4 V at different current densities ranging from 3 to 40 mA cm\u22122. The specific capacitance (Cm/Cs) is calculated according to the following Eqs. (1) and (2) : Cm = I\u2206t /m\u2206V Cs = I\u2206t /S\u2206V Where Cm (F g\u22121) is the specific capacitance of active materials, Cs (F cm\u22122), I (A), \u0394t (s), \u0394V (v), S (cm\u22122), and m (g) designate the area specific capacitance, discharge current, discharge time, charge/discharge window, and area of electroactive materials, respectively. The capacitance also can be calculated according to the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "following equation : Cs=\u222bI(V)dV/2vS\u0394V Where I(V) (A) represents the response current, V (V), v (V s\u22121), S (cm\u22122), and \u0394V (V) are the potential vs. Hg/HgO, the scan rate, the effective area of the electroactive materials, and the potential window, respectively. In Fig. S1, the area specific capacitance values are 4.85, 3.16, 2.18, 1.43, and 1.09 F cm\u22122 at the various scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s\u22121, respectively. The discharge curves for the NiCo2S4/NiS electrode tested between 0 and 0.4 V at different current densities are displayed in Fig. 5b. Moreover, Fig. 5c displays the variation in the Cm/Cs of NiCo2S4/NiS electrode as a function of discharge current density. In order to observe the specific discharge capacitance values easily, the values are calculated from the CD curves according to Eqs. (1) and (2), which are shown in Table. 1 . Encouragingly, the NiCo2S4/NiS electrode exhibit excellent performance which is superior to many previously reported about the pure NiCo2S4 or NiS supercapacitors . However, the Cm and Cs gradually reduce with the increase of current density because of the shortage of the active material at a higher current densities of the redox reaction . In addition, a higher current density prevents the diffusion of ions, and only a small amount of surface ions can be used for charge storage . Comfortingly, even at the high current density of 40 mA cm\u22122, the specific capacitance still maintains 50%, indicating the high retaining ratio and the excellent specific capacitance of the NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres. Fig. 5d shows the corresponding Nyquist plots with an equivalent circuit model which displays the resistance components of impedance, and the curves before and after cycling obtained by cycling at 10 mA cm\u22122 for 1000 continuous cycles. In the high frequency region, the semicircle is equal to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) which is connected with the microstructure corresponding to electrical conductivity of the unique electrode and the electrolyte-accessible area , and the internal resistance (Re) is represented by the intersection of the real axis. As we all know, the slope of the straight line in the low-frequency region is associated with the Warburg resistance (Zw), according to the ionic diffusion in the electrode materials . After cycling for 1000, the Re, Rct and Zw of the NiCo2S4/NiS electrode become a little bigger than that of the original electrode. Based on the equivalent circuit model, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) data are obtained for the before and after cycling (Re increases from 0.68 \u03a9 to 0.98 \u03a9, and Rct increases from 1.14 \u03a9 to 1.60 \u03a9), illustrating that the favorable stability and the fast ionic diffusion of the NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres electrode facilitate the electrolytes into the electrode material and reduce electrical resistance. These excellent capabilities can be attributed to the supplementary and synergy of the NiCo2S4 and NiS electrode materials, and the nickel foam which provides the porous conductive network for the materials. As shown in Fig. 5e, the long-term cycling performance of the NiCo2S4/NiS electrode, which is one of critical element for an excellent electroactive material in practical application, is also carried out by a galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge measurements within the potential window of 0\u20130.4 V at the current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. After 1000 charge\u2013discharge cycles, the specific capacitance remains at 90.3% of the initial value exhibiting a remarkable electrochemical cycling behavior, and the decrease of capacitance can be due to the disruption of the surface samples. In conclusion, the outstanding electrochemical performance provides a guarantee for the huge potential applications in supercapacitors. To investigate the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2S4/NiS material in potential applications, the NiCo2S4/NiS//activated carbon (AC) hollow nanospheres asymmetric supercapacitor is designed by the NiCo2S4/NiS material as the positive electrode and the low-cost activated carbon which provides a good connection between the electrochemical workstation and the device as the negative electrode. The weight ratio between negative electrode material and positive electrode material can be obtained from the following charge balance and mass balance equations: q+ = q\u2212 m+/m\u2212 = Cm\u2212\u2206V\u2212/Cm+\u2206V+ Where Cm+ and Cm- are the specific capacitance for positive electrode and the negative electrode in the three-electrode system, respectively. \u0394V+/\u0394V\u2212, q+/q\u2212, and m+/m\u2212 represent the potential window, charge and the weight for positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Therefore, the total mass (area) of the active materials is 12.4 mg (2.5 cm2). The electrochemical performances of the NiCo2S4/NiS and AC electrodes are evaluated by GCD and CV measurements within the 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte in a three-electrode system. In Fig. 6 a, the CV curve of the NiCo2S4/NiS electrode exhibits an obvious oxidation-reduction peaks on the potential window of 0\u20130.7 V which attribute to the redox reaction of NiCo2S4/NiS. In contrast, the CV curve for AC electrode under a potential window from \u22121 to 0 V provides an almost rectangular shape without any redox peaks due to the electrical double layer capacitive behavior. Fig. 6b shows the GCD curve of AC electrodes at a charge-discharge current density of 1 A g\u22121, and the Cm value of AC electrode calculated from the GCD curve through Eq. (1) is about 250 F g\u22121. The detailed CV and GCD curves, the specific capacitances at different scan rates/current densities, and the Nyquist plot of AC electrode are shown in Fig. S2 (a\u2013e), respectively. Besides, Table S1 displays the values of specific capacitance at various scan rates/current densities. Fig. 7 a and b show a series of CV and GCD curves of the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC asymmetric supercapacitor with different potential windows varying from 0 to 1 V to 0\u20131.6 V. As expected, the CV curves demonstrate a rectangular shapes as the increase of potential windows, indicating the excellent pseudocapacitive properties of the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC ACS. As shown in Fig. 7b, the GCD curves exhibit an ideal capacitive behavior without obvious polarization phenomenon of the curves, even at a large voltage windows of 1.6 V. Significantly, the calculated area specific capacitance values are 228, 425.8, 563.6, and 615 mF cm\u22122 when the potential window increases from. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "1 to 1.6 V, which demonstrate that the energy density may be able to markedly increased by at least 590% (Eq. (6)). In practical application, a high voltage which are available to meet the required output voltage can reduce the number of devices in series , and the enhancement of voltage windows is one of the critical factors to improve the electrochemical performance of these devices. Furthermore, the negative electrode can produce H2 when the electrode is measured at a higher voltage . To sum up, in order to obtain a superior performance of the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC asymmetric supercapacitor, the potential window of CV and GCD test can be set from 0 to 1.6 V. A group of CV curves at different scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s\u22121 are shown in Fig. 7c. The distorted rectangular shape of the curves is almost similar with varying scan rates, indicating the excellent pseudocapacitive and the electric double layer capacitive behaviour. The energy/power density of asymmetric device are calculated from the CD curves at different current densities according to the formulas given in Eqs. (6) and (7): E=Cm\u0394V2/2 P=E/\u0394t Where E (Wh kg\u22121) and P (W kg\u22121) is the energy density and power density, respectively, Cm(F g\u22121) is the specific capacitance which obtained from Eq. (1), \u0394V is the operating voltage window excluding the IR drop during the GCD measurement, \u0394t is the discharge time. Fig. 7d exposits the CD curves at various current densities from 1 to 5 mA cm\u22122, while the changing law of area specific capacitance shows in Fig. 7e. According to the Eqs. (1) and (2), the specific capacitances of the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC asymmetric supercapacitor are calculated to be 615, 550, 512, 485, and 463 mF cm\u22122 (123, 110, 102.4, 97, and 92.5 F g\u22121) at various current densities ranging from 1 to 5 mA cm\u22122, respectively. Among them, the highest specific capacitance of 123 F g\u22121 is far larger than usual activated carbon-based symmetric capacitors (\u223c20 A g\u22121) , suggesting the excellent pseudocapacitive furtherly. The energy densities of the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC ASC device are calculated to be 43.7, 39.1, and 36.4 Wh kg\u22121 at a power density of 160, 320, and 480 W kg\u22121, respectively, which exhibits obvious advantages over other reported results, such as the NiCo2S4//AC (25.5 Wh kg\u22121 at 334 W kg\u22121) , the NiCo2O4//AC (14.7 Wh kg\u22121 at 175 W kg\u22121) , Ni(OH)2/3D Ni//AC (21.8 Wh kg\u22121 at 0.66 W kg\u22121) , and the NiCo2O4-rGO//AC (23.3 Wh kg\u22121 at 324.9 W kg\u22121) . EIS analysis, as one of the most reliable and important method in practical applications, is measured with an amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range of 0.01\u2013105 Hz. Fig. 7e displays the Nyquist plots of the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC asymmetric supercapacitor before and after 3000 cycles. Compared to the Nyquist plots of the 1st cycle, the Re after 3000 cycles grows rarely (from 1.00 to 1.18 \u03a9), which demonstrates that the electron conductivity of the ACS is relatively well maintained. In addition, the Zw also shows a tiny change after 3000 cycles, indicating that the ion diffusion resistance has slightly increased. The small change of these resistances further certifies the good stability of the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC ACS and relatively high reversible redox reactions. To evaluate the application potential of the ACS furtherly, cycling performance was measured between 0\u20131.6 V at the current density of 1 mA cm\u22122 (Fig. 7g). It is worth noting that the specific capacitance continually increases until it reaches the maximum (158.1 F g\u22121) at the 120 cycle, and at last about 94.8% of the initial capacitance is remained after 3000 cycles, indicating the outstanding cycling stability. In summary, the excellent capacitive performances have provided guarantee for the energy storage devices in the potential applications, and it can be largely attributed to the following aspects: (1) The nickel foam as the substrate offers a large surface area for electrode materials, and promotes the fast transport of the electrolyte ions between the electrolyte and electrode. (2) Adding NiS to NiCo2S4 can not only improve the surface area of electrode materials, but also increase the surface roughness, and enhances the spread of the electrolyte ions. (3) This asymmetric supercapacitor consisting of the negative electrode of AC and the positive electrode of NiCo2S4/NiS can achieve a high energy/power densities and a wide potential window.  In summary, a simple and rapid approach to synthetize the NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres electrode materials with exceptional shape-invariant, useful features such as a lower cost and environmentally friendly, and outstanding energy storage material is put forwarded. The NiCo2S4/NiS hollow nanospheres are grown directly on the nickel foam which integrates the features of a shorter distance of migration and diffusion paths between electrolyte ions and electrons via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The electrode exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance (1947.5 F g\u22121 at 3 mA cm\u22122), as well as an excellent cycling stability (capacitance retention of 90.3% after 1000 cycles). Furthermore, the NiCo2S4/NiS//AC asymmetric device also shows a good energy density (43.7 Wh kg\u22121 at a power density of 160 W kg\u22121) and a superior capacitance retention (94.8% of the capacitance retained after 3000 cycles). The encouraging results we achieved can provide evidently efforts for the practical application in energy conversion/storage devices, especially in supercapacitors.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Numerous applications of this II\u2013VI compound have been proposed or realized in the form of thin films. For example, n-doped ZnO with high electron mobility is a good candidate as transparent conductive electrode [1], whereas the intrinsic ZnO has been used as buffer layer in solar cells [2,3] and transistors [4]. Moreover, the high absorption coefficient at photon energies larger than 3.3 eV makes ZnO suitable as UV radiation protective layer for organic solar cells (OSCs), if its deposition temperature can be low enough during manufacturing [5]. Thin films of ZnO can be prepared by solution methods such as spray pyrolysis, sol-gel, and chemical bath deposition. During the preparation of electronic devices, these methods can only be used for the first layers because the solution itself might damage the former deposited materials. Physical methods like pulsed laser and sputtering are widely used for metal oxide deposition, although they require high vacuum, and the temperature could be too high for organic substrates. An important alternative is the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, e.g. atomic layer deposition (ALD), among others. In ALD, two precursors are feed to a reaction chamber in a sequential way, so they react separately with the substrate to form an atomic layer of the desired compound. Because of the reactions are superficial and self-limiting, the ideal ALD leads to a homogenous composition and good thickness uniformity of the grown film. As a result, several properties of the ALD ZnO films have been found to be better than those of films obtained with other methods like metal organic CVD [6] and sputtering [7]. The incorporation of ALD layers into solar cells technology has also been studied, mainly to improve their efficiency or substituting hazardous materials such as cadmium sulfide. Applications and prospects of ALD films for photovoltaics have been summarized in a recent review [8]. In particular, 0.1\u2013100 nm of ZnO [9,10] or 150 nm of ZnO:Al thin films [11] have been used as electron selective layers or transparent conductive oxides, respectively, in OSCs. In this work, crystalline ZnO films, from 90 to more than 500 nm thick, were deposited by ALD at 150 and 175 \u00b0C. These are suitable temperatures for further application in several types of solar cells (e.g. OSCs, CIGS, etc.), where values under 200 \u00b0C are mandatory to avoid degradation [8]. The effect of the ALD deposition temperature and the number of cycles, on the thickness and roughness of the films were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and confirmed through the analysis and numerical fitting of their ellipsometric spectra. A typical behavior of the complex refractive index was also determined as a function of the deposition cycles for ZnO samples deposited at both temperatures.  ZnO thin film deposition was carried out in a Savannah-200 ALD system of Cambridge NanoTech Inc., with diethylzinc (DEZ, Aldrich 52%) as the metal precursor and deionized water as the oxygen source. The films were deposited on p-type silicon (1 0 0) wafers (c-Si) and Corning\u00ae glass. The glass slides were washed with neutral alkaline soap and cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with water and acetone for 10 min each. c-Si pieces of 2 \u00d7 2 cm2 were immersed in a 5% HF solution during 90s to remove the native oxide. Then the substrates were placed into the heated ALD chamber at 150 or 175 \u00b0C, depending on the case. Ultrapure N2 (99.9999%) was used as purging gas and it was kept at a flow rate of 20 sccm (cubic centimeters per minute at standard temperature and pressure). The film formation consisted of sequential pulses of: DEZ (0.2 s), N 2 (2 s), H2O (0.6 s) and N2 (2 s), which form a deposition cycle of 4.8 s. Films of 400, 800, 1200, 1600 and 2000 cycles were prepared in this work. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples deposited on c-Si were obtained with a Rigaku DMAX-2200 X-ray diffractometer at glancing angle of 0.5\u00b0. The crystal size of each sample was calculated through the Scherer formula, in which the instrumental widening was determined with the LaB6 standard. The Williamson-Hall (W-H) method was not used to estimate the crystal size and microstrain, since the XRD peaks of the samples could not be fitted as Lotentzian profiles. SEM cross section micrographs were taken in a Hitachi FE-SEM 5500 microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were made in a Perkin Elmer PHI 5100 equipment. The chemical analysis by XPS was calibrated by taking the carbon 1 s peak (284.6 eV) as reference. The specular reflectance and transmittance spectra of ZnO on glass were obtained with a spectrophotometer Jasco V-670 in a wavelength range from 240 to 840 nm. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements of ZnO/c-Si samples were made with a Horiba Jobin Yvon UVISEL DH10 Phase Modulated ellipsometer, in the photon energy range of 1.5\u20135.0 eV at angle of incidence of 70\u00b0. The experimental data of SE are a set of measurements of the \u03a8 and \u0394 angles which are related to the complex reflectance ratio (\u03c1) as follows [12]: \u03c1 = rp/rs = tan \u03a8 exp(i\u0394), where rp and rs are the complex Fresnel coefficients of the studied system (e.g. air/ZnO film/c-Si substrate), for polarization parallel (p) and perpendicular (s) to the plane of incidence. Moreover, the Fresnel coefficients at each interface are functions of both the intrinsic material properties (e.g. complex refractive index) and the structural parameters (e.g. thickness and roughness). Therefore, \u03a8 and \u0394 data implicitly contain the information of real refractive indices (n) and extinction coefficients (k) of air, ZnO and c-Si, as well as the thickness of the ZnO film (d). To determine the values of n, k and d of ZnO from \u03a8 and \u0394, a model dependent analysis has to be performed by fitting model parameters to minimize the mean square root error between the experimental and model\u2013calculated \u03a8 and \u0394 spectra, evaluated through a figure of merit (\u03c7. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "2) based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [12].  The stoichiometric reaction between DEZ and H2O in an ALD cycle is assumed to be [13]: Zn(C2H5)2(g)+H2O(g)\u2192ZnO(s)+2C2H6(g). Ideally, after the surface reaction the unique solid product should be a ZnO monolayer on the substrate. However, the XPS spectra of the obtained ZnO thin films suggest non stoichiometric ZnO and the presence of carbon and oxygen peaks. Fig.\u00a01 a gives the survey of XPS spectra of two ZnO samples deposited at 150 and 175 \u00b0C after 2000 cycles. For both samples Zn and O are identified. The presence of C could be the contamination from the sample handling, and also from the incomplete reaction of DEZ. Fig.\u00a01(b) shows the high resolution XPS spectra of the Zn 2p doublet with binding energies at \u223c1023.3 and \u223c1045.5 eV, those could be assigned as Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 binding states of ZnO, respectively [14\u201316]. In the literature, the binding energy of Zn 2p3/2 of a bulk ZnO is reported as 1022.0 \u00b1 0.4 eV [14]. Due to the reaction of H2O during the ALD process, the slight shift to higher energy of the Zn 2p3/2 signals in the final products suggests the presence of hydroxide species, as observed precisely in ZnO compound [17]. Fig.\u00a01c gives the high resolution XPS spectra of O1s that contain two signals: the 530.8 eV signal is attributed to Zn O bond [18\u201320]. The second, at 532.5 eV, is related to chemisorbed oxygen [18] or superficial hydroxyl groups [19,20]. As will be seen in the following XRD analysis and the bandgap determinations, the crystalline ZnO phase predominates in the ALD samples. The higher intensities of 532.5 eV signals suggest that the OH groups should be on the surface of ALD samples. O2 and H2O in the ambient also contribute to these signals. Finally, Fig.\u00a01(b)\u00a0and\u00a0(c) clearly show an increase in the ZnO related signals with the deposition temperature, which is explained by an increase in completion or extension of the reaction of the Zn precursor during the ALD process. To confirm the formation of the crystalline ZnO phase in the ALD films, Fig.\u00a02 a\u00a0and\u00a0b shows XRD patterns of all the films deposited at both temperatures (Fig.\u00a02a\u00a0and\u00a0b). The diffraction peaks coincide quite well with the crystalline planes of the hexagonal wurtzite (PDF#36-1451), with the differences in the preferential orientation: the (1 0 0) plane (at 2\u03b8 = 31.8\u00b0) has the maximum intensity in those ALD films, while for the wurtzite, it is the (1 0 1) plane (at 2\u03b8 = 36.2\u00b0) with the maximum value. Only the wurtzite phase exists in the ALD films; no other crystalline zinc compound was found in this case. In the same figures, the effect of the deposition temperature on the diffraction patterns of the products is observed in the relative intensities of a couple of crystalline planes; the intensities of the (0 0 2) and (1 0 3) planes of the samples deposited at 175 \u00b0C are greater than those of the films deposited at 150 \u00b0C. It suggests that the temperature promotes changes in the crystalline orientation, as it is well documented in the literature [21,22]. The absolute intensity of each diffraction peak increases with the deposition cycles, which is an indication of increment in the crystallite population, but not necessarily of the crystal size. By using the Scherrer formula, the crystal sizes of the ALD films were estimated from each crystalline plane. Fig.\u00a02c shows that whereas the crystal size, corresponding to the (0 0 2) plane, tends to reach its maximum for samples of 1200 and 1600 cycles, the sizes corresponding to the (1 0 1) plane as well as the averaged size over 7 or 8 crystalline planes, increase with the cycles number. Furthermore, the higher the temperature, the greater the average crystal size, as the cycles number were greater than 800 (Fig.\u00a02c). From XRD results, it can be concluded that the ZnO films were polycrystalline with crystal sizes between 12 and 21 nm. These small crystals are arranged in larger columnar clusters, as observed in the SEM micrographs of the tilted cross section of the film deposited at 175 \u00b0C after 2000 cycles (Fig.\u00a03 a). It can be seen that small clusters were formed on c-Si at the beginning of the ALD process. As the cycles increase from 400 to 2000, larger grains (Fig.\u00a03c) grow on the previous ones (Fig.\u00a03b) and piled up as columns perpendicular to the surface of the substrate (Fig.\u00a03a). The surface of the film with 2000 cycles (top view of Fig.\u00a03a\u00a0and\u00a0c) shows large pyramidal grains between 50 and 300 nm long. Comparing these micrographs with the crystal size data from XRD (Fig.\u00a02c), it is inferred that those large vertical columns and pyramidal grains of ZnO consist of smaller crystals with the wurtzite structure. The influence of the temperature was reflected, not only on the crystal sizes (Fig.\u00a02c), but also on the surface topology of the deposited films. Fig. 4 gives the cross section micrographs of the ALD samples after 2000 cycles at 150 and 175 \u00b0C. It is seen that the surfaces of the films are quite rough and their roughness increases with the deposition temperature. From Fig.\u00a04a it can be roughly estimated that the thickness of the film deposited at 150 \u00b0C falls between the highest (540 nm) and lowest (470 nm) points leading to a rough layer of about 70 nm. In the case of 175 \u00b0C (Fig.\u00a04b), the highest and lowest points were 610 and 505 nm, respectively, resulting in a roughness of about 100 nm. A systematic estimation of the thickness and roughness, together with the optical properties of the ALD films, can be obtained by SE [12]. ZnO is a semiconductor with direct bandgap, which presents a complicated behavior in the neighborhood of this band to band electronic transition. The existing excitons strongly couple with the probe light and their absorption is superposed to the structure of critical points (interband transitions). Furthermore, there exist other electronic transitions, which occur at energies higher than the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "bandgap [23]. Thus, the full understanding of the optical properties of ZnO in the bandgap region would require a theoretical analysis of its band structure and such study is beyond the scope of this work. Here, the Tauc-Lorentz model [24] with two oscillators, was chosen to approximate the optical response of the ALD films because of the polycrystalline structure observed in their diffraction patterns. The second oscillator is added to help reproducing the optical response in the bandgap region and the electronic transitions at higher energies. The structure of the proposed model for the data fitting was a multilayer system consisted of air/roughness (50% air\u201350% ZnO)/homogeneous ZnO film/c-Si substrate. The roughness was represented by the effective medium approximation (EMA) of Bruggeman [12]. The fittings matched quite well with the experimental data for all the ALD samples; Fig. 5 only shows those corresponding to the film deposited at 150 \u00b0C after 1200 cycles. In the whole photon energy range, all the SE spectra present two types of behavior around 3.3 eV. Below that energy, the signals were oscillatory, characteristic of a transparent zone. Above that energy, monotonic lines were observed and the material starts absorbing light. It indicates that the bandgap of all the ALD samples is about 3.3 eV, corresponding to the crystalline ZnO compound as observed in XRD. Moreover, the number of oscillations increases with the deposition cycles number (or thickness of the films) in the transparent zone, and the absorption zone looks alike independently on the deposition cycles number. These phenomena confirm the formation of thicker ZnO films with the ALD cycles number. After the fitting process, the adjusted parameters, i.e. the thickness of the homogeneous layer (d 1), the roughness (d 2), n and k of ALD samples were obtained. Taking into account that these fall within the reliability limit and were corroborated by the comparison between the experimental and calculated reflectance spectra (not shown here), the values of d 1, d 2 and the total thickness, dT = d 1 + d 2, were plotted as a function of the deposition cycles number. It is shown in Fig.\u00a06 (a) that after 400 cycles, n was 90.4 \u00b1 0.2 nm for 150 \u00b0C and 89.7 \u00b1 0.1 nm for 175 \u00b0C, corresponding to deposition rates of 0.226 and 0.224 nm/cycle, respectively. The averaged deposition rate slightly increases after 800 cycles: 0.233 nm/cycle for 150 \u00b0C and 0.238 nm/cycle for 175 \u00b0C. The same trend was observed after 1200 cycles: 0.237 nm/cycle (150 \u00b0C) and 0.239 nm/cycle (175 \u00b0C). It suggests that until 1200 cycles, the total thickness of the ALD films did not show any dependence on the temperature, and the deposition rate increased slightly with the cycles from about 0.224\u20130.239 nm/cycle. However, as the cycles were over 1200, the effect of the temperature on the film thickness was notable; the deposition rate was 0.245 and 0.249 nm/cycle for films deposited at 150 \u00b0C in the cases of 1600 and 2000 cycles, respectively, and 0.246 nm/cycle for the corresponding films deposited at 175 \u00b0C. The final thickness dT of the film deposited at 150 \u00b0C after 2000 cycles was 521.6 \u00b1 5.0 nm and that of the film deposited at 175 \u00b0C was 538.5 \u00b1 21.3 nm. These values were smaller than those estimated from SEM, but the same trend was proved. Through analyzing the d 1 and d 2 curves in Fig.\u00a06b, it is observed that the thickness of the homogeneous ZnO films, d 1, did not varied with temperature. However, the thickness of the roughness, d 2, notably changed for cycles number greater than 1200. For example, d 2 was 29.6 \u00b1 0.7 nm after 2000 cycles at 150 \u00b0C and 47.5 \u00b1 12.7 nm for deposition at 175 \u00b0C. These phenomena were corroborated with the data obtained from SEM images (Fig. 4), although the absolute values of the roughness differ. A plausible explanation for this disagreement between SE and SEM data can be obtained from the simultaneous increases of the \u03c7 2 values and the roughness, with the deposition cycles number. This behavior was caused by the sensitivity of the ellipsometric measurements to the light scattering at highly rough surfaces, which leads to a decrease of the accuracy of the SE results due to depolarization effects. Together with the results from XRD, it gives us an insight about the growth mechanism of the ALD films. On the one hand, the negligible effect of the two temperatures, 150 and 175 \u00b0C, on the growth rate could be interpreted as the coincidence in the dynamic equilibrium between the extension of the DEZ reaction and the consumption of OH groups. It seems that a higher temperature the completion of the reaction of DEZ increases and, at the same time, the amount of OH groups is reduced (Fig. 1), resulting in similar deposition rates at both temperatures (lower temperatures, 125 and 100 \u00b0C, induced water condensation that impacted negatively on the quality of the films due to the difficulty to purge water at such temperatures). On the other hand, the same dynamic equilibrium impacts on the roughness of the films. From application point of view, a rough ZnO film could work as a light trapping inducer, augmenting the path of the light travelling inside the material and creating more excitons (electron-hole pairs) in an OSC. The other achievement from the fittings of the SE spectra is the extraction of the information about the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of ALD samples. Fig. 7 shows those of the films deposited at 150 \u00b0C. In the transparent wavelength region (400\u2013700 nm), all the films showed an increment of the n values with respect to the cycles and k = 0, irrespective to the film thickness (cycles). In this wavelength range the obtained n values are similar to the reported ones [25\u201327]. In the absorption region (250\u2013380 nm), as the wavelength is closer to or lower than the bandgap (around 380 nm), k increases and it reaches its maximum. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "at about 370 nm and then decreases. Meanwhile, the corresponding n of the same samples decreases continuously with the wavelength from about 2.55 to 1.9 as the wavelength goes from 380 to 250 nm. ZnO is an anisotropic material, however, it is well documented that with the regular configuration of the ellipsometer, it is not possible to differentiate between the ordinary and the extraordinary contributions to the refractive index [27]. Thus, the optical properties shown here are an average and the differences observed between them could have their origin in the changes in crystalline orientation observed in XRD. The effect of the roughness on films deposited at cycles number greater than 1200 is another reason of the different behavior of the optical properties in the absorption zone. Finally, Fig. 8 shows n & k spectra of films after deposition of 1200 cycles at 150 and 175 \u00b0C. In this case, the effect of the temperature on the optical properties of films was negligible, as indicated in Fig. 8. In that figure, the bandgap of the ZnO films was estimated as 3.26 eV for both deposition temperatures. On the other hand, by measuring the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the corresponding ALD films deposited on glass and using the Tauc plots, the bandgap of all the ALD films showed values between 3.26 and 3.30 eV, (inset of Fig. 8 for samples of 1200 cycles), which were close to the reported values for ZnO compounds [25\u201327]. The bandgap values determined by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy confirmed again that the main compound inside all the ALD films studied in this work is zinc oxide.  Polycrystalline ZnO films with columnar microstructure were deposited by ALD at relatively low temperatures (150 and 175 \u00b0C) with different deposition cycles (400\u20132000). OH groups were found in all the samples, with a larger content in the lower temperature deposited ones, which should be concentrated at the surface of the ALD samples. The total films thicknesses were linearly dependent on the number of deposition cycles, in agreement with the typical ALD growth. The roughness of the films increases with the deposition cycles, and modified the refractive index and extinction coefficient of corresponding films in the absorption zone. The roughness on the surface of ZnO films also increases with the deposition temperature when the deposition cycles number is greater than 1200. The observed correlations between the structural, morphological and optical properties of the ALD ZnO films and their deposition conditions, can serve as decisive factors in the selection of their final role as semiconductor thin films for electronic or optoelectronic applications.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Polymers are among the most explored materials that have been contributed to the field of renewable energy [1,2]. One of the most useful applications of polymers is the manufacture of polymer electrolyte (PE), which is performed by dissolving an ionic salt into the macromolecular chain of polymers. Environmental and eco-friendly polymers derived from natural and renewable resources have emerged as promising options for synthesizing PEs. Most researched electrochemical energy devices have shown the eligibility of PEs in applications such as batteries, capacitors, and solar cells. Furthermore, PEs have various advantages like good safety, acceptable thermal and mechanical stability, inexpensive, and excellent compatibility. While, some drawbacks include low ambient conductivity and high resistance at the interfacial region with electrodes. These drawbacks can be minimized using different approaches such as blending, incorporation of nanoparticles, and plasticizing [3-5]. In nature, many materials contain biopolymers with their high affinity for solvents, cheap, and stability. The most commonly used biopolymers in solid-state PEs are chitosan (CS) [6], cellulose with its derivatives [7], and starch [8]. Due to its solid-state behavior, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) can overcome the challenges in liquid electrolytes, such as leakage problems and necessity of a separator to avoid contact between electrolyte and electrodes, which can significantly reduce the production cost [9]. Usually, the backbone of polysaccharides includes oxygen-containing functional groups that are attached to them. These oxygen atoms possess single pair of electrons to interact with cations from the dopant salt [10]. Methylcellulose (MC) as a promising biopolymer has been widely employed in electrochemical devices. MC is well-known for its good mechanical and electrical characteristics and acceptable film-forming quality. In addition, MC contains various functional groups like ester (RCOOR\u2019), alcohol (ROH), and ether (ROR\u2019), which are favorable for ionic conduction mechanisms [11,12]. Besides, dextran (DN), with its two significant functional groups of (glycosidic bond and hydroxyl) ensured its capacity to operate as a polymer host. In polymer-based electrolytes, optimizing ionic conductivity is one of the key factors that should be considered. Among various approaches, polymer blending method is found to be effective and it can result in high conductivity compared to single polymer based electrolytes [2,4]. This can be correlated to the lowering of crystallinity degree and glass transition temperature upon blending, which easy the ionic conduction process [4]. Another viable technique to enhance ionic conductivity is plasticization. In this technique polymers combined with a low molecular weight plasticizer, which aids in the dissolution and dissociation of salts; while, increasing charge carrier mobility via the increment of the channels for ion conduction. Regarding this, glycerol was employed in many electrolyte systems in energy storage devices to enhance ionic conductivity and other crucial parameters [13-15]. Aside from minimizing environmental contamination caused by the usage of lithium salt, many researches have demonstrated that ammonium salt possesses desirable PE properties with elevated ions dissociation [16]. Furthermore, ammonium salts are frequently utilized in the formation of PE systems due to their capacity to achieve high ionic conductivity while keeping good compatibility and thermal stability [17]. Therefore, a combination of ammonium salt along with natural or bio-based polymer like MC and DN for electrolyte preparation and employment in energy device application are of great importance to reduces the impact of electronic wastes and environmental contamination [4,18]. Moreover, this approach can minimize the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, which is the main cause of global warming [18,19]. This is due to their interesting properties of these bio-polymers, like eco-friendly nature, non-toxicity, biodegradability, and sustainability [2,4]. Buraidah and Arof [20] have used ammonium iodide (NH4I) for their PE system, and it was reported that the (NH4I) improved the ionic conductivity compared to other ammonium salts. Nowadays, natural SPEs have gained interest in electrochemical devices such as supercapacitors (SCs), fuel cells, and proton batteries. SCs provide a low-cost solution with superior performance like outstanding charge\u2013discharge current ability, high-temperature ranges, and high efficiency [21-23]. Electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) is one of the most promising energy storage systems due to its long-life cycle compared to a secondary battery, and relatively high-power density along with, high capacitance, safety and maintenance-free compared to conventional capacitors [24]. Usually, in the EDLC device, an electrolyte with two electrode materials is connected. The EDLC is typically fabricated with carbon-based electrodes, for instance, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, graphite, activated carbon (AC), and carbon nanosized electrodes [25,26]. AC has been chosen in this study due to its high porosity (with its width of 2\u00a0nm), large surface area (i.e., more ions could be absorbed), cost-effectiveness, chemical stability, and high conductivity [27]. The ECHDs based on environmental friendly biopolymers are the focus of many research groups due to their low toxic behavior. Our research group is intensively works on preparation of electrolyte based on biopolymers. This study explore the eligibility of ecofriendly polymer based electrolyte system for energy device application, using MC and DN biopolymers as a host matrix and NH4I as dopant salt, with the aid of glycerol as plasticizer. Intensive literature survey has revealed that such a combination of polymer based electrolyte system has not been investigated yet. In the current work the electrochemical behavior of the best conductive electrolyte system will be studied and then used in EDLC application. In this investigation, 40\u00a0wt% of NH4I was added to 60\u00a0wt% MC: 40\u00a0wt% DN host blend system with different concentrations of glycerol to reach the highest ionic conductivity that eligible for energy device application.  MC, DN, NH4I, and glycerol were used for the preparation of the electrolytes. Sigma-Aldrich (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) provided all the above mentioned materials. Magma value also provided carbon black (CB) and AC as well as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF). The MC-DN blend polymer was made by dissolving and stirring 60\u00a0wt% of MC and 40\u00a0wt% of DN separately in a 1% solution of acetic acid (50\u00a0mL) for\u00a0\u223c\u00a02\u00a0h at room temperature. Next, these solutions were blended and stirred by a magnetic stirrer for\u00a0\u223c\u00a04\u00a0h to make the blend. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "solution homogenous. Subsequently, a fixed amount of NH4I (40\u00a0wt%) has been dissolved in the blend solution to obtain PEs based on MC-DN- NH4I. Afterwards, in steps of 14\u00a0wt%, glycerol was loaded from 14 to 42\u00a0wt% to the MC-DN- NH4I mixture, and constantly stirred to produce plasticized PEs. The electrolytes were coded as MDNG1, MDNG2, and MDNG3 for the MC-DN- NH4I containing 14, 28, and 42\u00a0wt% of glycerol, respectively. After that, the solution casting procedure in the designated Petri dishes was performed by leaving the electrolytes at ambient temperature to evaporate slowly. Finally, the free-solvent films were obtained and then transferred to a desiccator to dry further. The Spotlight 400 spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to record FTIR spectra spanning from 550 to 4000\u00a0cm\u22121 to confirm the creation and complexation of the plasticized electrolytes. EIS was used to study the electrochemical properties of the samples. The spectra were collected from a 3532\u201350 LCR HiTESTER (HIOKI, Nagano, Japan) at the frequency range between 50\u00a0Hz and 5\u00a0MHz. The electrolytes were set at a thickness of 150\u2013152 \u00b5A and placed between two stainless-steel (SS) electrodes. The cell was linked to a computer and configured to determine the imaginary (Z'') and real (Z') parts of complex impedance spectroscopy (Z*). The transference numbers of ions (tion) and electrons (tel) were determined by polarizing a cell of SS/uppermost conducting electrolyte/SS at a voltage of 0.2\u00a0V via transference number measurement (TNM). At room temperature, the transport numbers of the samples were determined using a DP 3003 Digital DC power supply (V & A instrument, Shanghai, China). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measured the maximum operational potential for the highest conducting system. A Digi-IVY DY2300 potentiostat was used to carry out the LSV. The LSV was measured at 10\u00a0mV/s scan rate with a working voltage range of 0 to 2.5\u00a0V. The EDLC fabrication process has been described in great depth in our previous publications [16,28].  The interactions between ions and atoms of the MC-DN blend systems were investigated using the FTIR technique. In the electrolyte systems, such interactions cause a change in the vibration modes. Fig. 1 shows the FTIR spectra for the plasticized MC-DN-NH4I systems in the wavenumber range from 550\u00a0cm\u22121 to 4000\u00a0cm\u22121 [7]. FTIR spectra demonstrate how hydrogen bonding develops via changing the stretching vibration. A broad peak that appeared at\u00a0\u223c\u00a03400\u00a0cm\u22121 is associated with the O-H stretching, while the ether band can be observed through appearing the peak at\u00a0\u223c\u00a01060\u00a0cm\u22121. From Fig. 1, both symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of (COO\u00af) can be found at wavenumbers of\u00a0\u223c\u00a01400\u00a0cm\u22121 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a01600\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively [29,30]. A narrow peak observed at\u00a0\u223c\u00a01025\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponds to the C-O bond in the ether band. While, the peak intensity changes as the glycerol content has increased. The appearance of this peak is correlated to the high chain flexibility around the glycosidic bond in DN. Moreover, DN is also exhibits the observed (C-H) stretching peak at\u00a0\u223c\u00a02890\u00a0cm-1. The peak at\u00a0\u223c\u00a0950\u00a0cm\u22121 is induced by the glycosidic bridge and covalent vibrations of the C-O-C bond, which verifies the glycosidic bond. In the MC-DN blend system, the NH4 + ion is clearly formed from the NH4I in association with the oxygen atoms of the (O-H) and (R-O-R\u2019) groups. By altering the (C\u00a0=\u00a0O), (C-O) bond in ether and (O-H) groups, these interactions enhance protonation to the PE system [28,31,32]. According to previous study, irregular peaks and changes in the intensities of functional groups could be used to detect the interaction among the constituents of the PE [33]. Overall, the addition of glycerol plasticizer into the MC-DN-NH4I system caused changes in the band intensities. Glycerol causes to dissociate more salts into ions, resulting in a high number of ions available to interact with the MC-DN blend systems. It is worth mentioning that the variation of bands intensity is strongly associated to variation in macromolecular order. The obtained outcome is regarded as a clear evidence for the complexation occurrence and achieving good miscibility, which is vital in the preparation of PE systems. EIS is a non-destructive and successful routine for studying ionic conductors. It is a powerful technique in analyzing performance of electrochemical double-layer capacitors, ionic liquids, ionically conducting polymers, fused salts, rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, and glasses. Furthermore, EIS is used to analyze device properties and transport investigations in ionic conductors [34]. Fig. 2 exhibits the Cole-Cole plot for the MS-DN-NH4I containing different weight percent of glycerol. As hypothesized, the impedance plots show a spike without semicircle. The high-frequency responses could study ion transport through the electrolyte bulk. Whereas, the low-frequency responses could be used to detect ion generation at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces, which denotes a double-layer capacitance formation where a spike emerges [35-37]. In this study, the half-circle has been vanished as a consequence of ion migration to the interfacial area between the surface of the electrodes and electrolyte. Using the data points, the Rb is calculated at the position where the tail meets the real (Zr). The ionic conductivities of all samples are determined through the (Rb) and sample thickness using eqtion (1): \u03c3dc=1Rb\u00d7tA For the electrolyte, A specifies its surface area; while, t defines its thickness. Table 1 presents the ionic conductivity (\u03c3dc \u03c3dc) of glycerol plasticized in the MC-DN-NH4I systems. In the above equation, it is clear that there is inverse proportionality relation between the (\u03c3dc \u03c3dc) and Rb. It can be seen that loading the glycerol from 14\u00a0wt% to 42\u00a0wt% has caused a reduction in the Rb value, implying an increase in ionic conductivity. The relationship between ionic conductivity, mobility (\u03bc) and ion density (\u03b7) is well-known and mathematically can be expressed as: \u03c3=\u2211\u03b7q\u03bc Here q represents the electric charge [38-40]. It is of great importance that the obtained ionic conductivity of the PE lies in between the range of 10\u22123 to 10\u22125 S/cm, so as to be applied in energy storage devices such as EDLCs. The maximum ionic conductivity recorded in this study is found to be (3.24\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124) S/cm for the electrolyte containing 42\u00a0wt% of glycerol. The ionic conductivity attained in this study is promising for device. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "application, and it is comparable to the glycerolized CS-MC- ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) system that employed in energy storage application [41]. Maheshwari et al. [42] have documented the ionic conductivity value of (1.66\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123) S/cm for their electrolyte system based on DN-polyvinyl alcohol doped with ammonium nitrate. EIS data fitting technique is a frequently used method to achieve a better view of the entire system using the equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) model. The circuit presented in this model comprises essential electrical components, such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors. The elements must be based on the physical electrochemistry of the systems in order to be usable. The EEC technique is employed to study the EIS because it is straightforward and gives a complete view of the system. The EEC model generally consists of a double constant phase element, namely (CPE1) and (CPE2), with included Rb for the charge carrier motion in the bulk region. The EEC model represents Rb in parallel with CPE1 in the high frequency and Rb in series with CPE2 in the low frequency. The CPE spike is caused by the double-layer capacitance inhomogeneity of the electrode surface [40,43]. Due to the absence of a semicircle in the low frequency, the impedance plot in Fig. 2 can be approximated by an EEC consisting of Rb in series with CPE2. The impedance of CPE (ZCPE) is determined using equation (3) [44]: ZCPE=1C\u03c9pcos\u03c0p2-isin\u03c0p2 Here, C signifies the capacitance of the CPE, p stands for the deviation of the plot from the axis, and \u03c9 denotes the angular frequency. Furthermore, the real and imaginary parts of impedance can be written as: Zr=Rb2C1\u03c9p1cos\u03c0p12+Rb2RbC1\u03c9p1cos\u03c0p12+Rb2C12\u03c92p1+1+cos\u03c0p22C2\u03c9p2 Zi=Rb2C1\u03c9p1sin\u03c0p122RbC1\u03c9p1cos\u03c0p12+Rb2C12\u03c92P1+1+sin\u03c0p22C2\u03c9p2 Here, both the C1 and C2 are represent the capacitance of the CPE1 in the bulk electrolyte and CPE2 at the sample-electrode interfaces. Also, both p1 and p2 represent the deviation of half-circle from the imaginary axis and spike from the real axis, respectively [44]. The fitting parameters of the EEC for the MC-DN-NH4I systems containing varying quantities of glycerol are summarized in Table 2 . In this study, several equations have been used to calculate the transport parameters of diffusion coefficient (D), ion density (n), and ion mobility (\u00b5) from the impedance data, which comprise a spike only. At the beginning, the following relationships were used to compute D of ionic species: D=Doexp{-0.0297[lnDo]2-1.4348lnDo-14.504} Do=4k2l2Rb4\u03c9min3 where, l signifies the sample thicknesses, \u03c9 min is the angular frequency at the lowest Zi value. Also, equation (8) is used to calculate the ionic mobility: \u03bc=eDKbT where, the Boltzmann constant is denoted by Kb; while, T stands for the absolute temperature. Since \u03c3dc \u03c3dc is well-known, it is easy to determine n using equation (2) [13,29]. It can be seen that the glycerol as a plasticizer has played the key role in improving the transport parameters, as demonstrated in Table 2. This enhancement is owing to the increased chain flexibility as a result of the glycerol inclusion, which consequently the ionic conductivity of the system boosted. The dissociation of NH4I salt is also facilitated by a glycerol molecule, which is another factor to increase the charge carrier density. Additionally, the attraction forces between oppositely charged ions are significantly reduced, thereby the chance of ion association is minimized, that is crucial for maintaining maximum conductive ions. This technique is among the most common procedure for decisive the transference number, which is used to assess whether the conductivity in biopolymer-based electrolytes is caused by ions or electrons [45]. The ion transport in PEs have to be close up to an perfect value of 1, so as to be applicable in the EDLC applications. Fig. 3 displays the polarization curve alongside time for the maximum conducting sample (MDNG3) at a working voltage of 0.2\u00a0V. It is noteworthy that, a high current value of 54.8 \u00b5A can be noticed at the onset of the polarization, indicating that both electrons and ions have been conducted. Then, the current is dropped to 11 \u00b5A after 10\u00a0s. At this point, some of the ions from the PE become trapped at the surface of the SS electrodes, forming a charge double-layer. The drop in the initial current is mainly due to the decrease of charge carriers and increase in electron mobility in the plasticized electrolyte system. Beyond 10\u00a0s, the current slightly declined versus time, and it begins to stabilize at 2.5 \u00b5A. At this step, the cell is wholly polarized, and only electrons could move through the stainless-steel (SS) electrodes. This current waveform is typical for ionic conductors [46\u201348]. The ion (tion) and electron (tel) transport for the uppermost conducting the MC-DN-NH4I-glycerol system was then calculated using the following equations, where it was situated between two SS electrodes: tion=Ii-ISSIi tion=1-tel Here, Ii signifies the initial current covers both ions and electrons, Iss stands for the steady-state current, which includes electron only. From the equations above, the tion in this work is 0.952, verifying the dominancy of ions in the MC-DN-NH4I-glycerol system. Our previous report for the plasticized MC-DN-NH4PF6 displayed the tion value of 0.92, which is lower than this work [30]. In another recent study, an electrolyte system of MC: sodium iodide (NaI):glycerol has shown the tion of 0.963, which is comparable to the current obtained value [45]. In the energy devices study, a breakdown voltage of electrolytes must be evaluated in order to ensure the stability and safety of the device. The LSV analysis could be used to determine the highest potential limit of an electrolyte [49]. Fig. 4 portrays the LSV for the MDNG3 sample of the MC-DN-NH4I-glycerol system. It can be seen that the working potential is from 0\u00a0V to 2.5\u00a0V at the scan rate of 10\u00a0mV/s. One can notice that, very small current can pass through the electrolyte without decomposition until it reaches its breakdown potential of 2\u00a0V. After this point, the current significantly increased above 2\u00a0V due to the breakdown of the sample. This indicates that the anodic stability window of the MC-DN-NH4I-glycerol is 2\u00a0V [51-53]. In proton-based energy device applications, the lowest potential window required. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "for a PE system is usually acknowledged to be 1\u00a0V. This is to ensure that, even in the case of using different electrode materials the electrolyte can withstand the applied voltage and does not undergo decomposition [50]. The stability of the prepared bio-based electrolyte system in this study is way above the suggested value, which highlights the suitability of this system for electrochemical energy device applications. This emphasizes that, the MC-DN-NH4I-glycerol system is acceptable in terms of safety and stability for EDLC application [54]. The current system potential window is higher than the system of PVA-MC-NH4I-glycerol, as reported in the literature [12]. The performance of EDLC is studied using the cyclic voltammetry technique, which reveals the nature of charge storage at specific interfaces in the anodic and cathodic regions and the electrochemical behavior of the material [55-57]. The cyclic voltammogram of the constructed EDLC is shown in Fig. 5 at 10, 20, 50, and 100\u00a0mV/s scan rates. The specific capacitance (Cspe) for the EDLC was calculated using the following relation: Ccv=\u222bViVfIVdV2mvVf-Vi where, the initial and final applied potential were denoted by Vi and Vf, respectively. m and \u03c5 represent the mass of active materials and sweep rate, correspondingly. While, the I(V)dV represents the actual area of the CV curve obtained from the origin 9.0 softwear. In all tested scan rates, the voltammogram had an almost rectangular shape, which is related to ideal polarized electrodes and capacitive behavior, in which no noticeable peaks were identified across the scanned potential area. This phenomenon shows the development of an EDLC. The absence of peaks indicates that electrons play no part in the generation of a supercapacitor, suggesting the presence of a non-Faradaic method that sustains its EDLC properties [58-60]. The small deviation from perfect rectangular form may be attributed to the internal resistance and electrode porosity. The AC electrode porosity is responsible for the leaf-like shape of the CV profile, resulting from a relatively high internal resistance [16]. Table 3 depicts the variation of specific capacitance against scan rates. It is noticeable that the Cspe value and the pattern of the CV plots were affected by the change in scan rates. The number of accumulated charges on the electrode\u2019s surface declined at higher sweep rates due to the smaller contribution of ions for polarization. On the other hand, the approximate rectangular shapes of the constructed EDLC indicate that its properties are close to those of an ideal capacitor [61-63]. To confirm the EDLC\u2019s performance, GCD cycling was performed on the fabricated EDLC at a working potential of 0 to 0.9\u00a0V for the highest conducting sample. The EDLC\u2019s rechargeability was tested by applying a current density of 0.2\u00a0mA/cm2 and recording over 100 cycles, as shown in Fig. 6 . Once the current is applied to the system, the ions migrate from the bulk electrolyte to the interfacial area, producing a charge double-layer. The GCD pattern of the assembled EDLC exhibits an almost linear behavior, indicating the capacitive nature of the EDLC [64]. One can note that the EDLC displays a rapid drop in potential (Vd) at the initial discharging process, as a result a perfect triangular form of the GCD pattern was not obtained. The deviation from ideal triangle shape is due to the bulk electrolyte, internal resistance, and AC roughness. The linearity of the discharge characteristics also demonstrates a pure electrostatic interaction between charged pore surface and ion [65]. Additionally, the symmetric triangles of the GCD profile is regarded as a good evidence for the existence of a non-Faradaic charge storage mechanism. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the drop in voltage (Vd) measured during the four initial cycles was approximately 0.1\u00a0V. This could be corresponding to the increment of the internal resistance and ohmic reductions across the equivalence series resistance (ESR) of the cell, as shown from the following equation [22,66]: ESR=Vdi Fig. 7 shows the ESR relative to the cycle numbers up to 100 cycles. It should be highlighted that the ESR recorded at the first cycle is\u00a0\u223c\u00a0165\u00a0\u03a9 and reaches its optimum value of\u00a0\u223c\u00a0170\u00a0\u03a9 during the 30th cycle due to the highest value of the drop voltage at this stage. The internal resistance of the manufactured EDLC appeared in charge\u2013discharge plot can be correlated to the current collector, and a gap at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces. Overall, the ESR values are found to be in the range of between 165 and 170\u00a0\u03a9, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Interestingly, the ESR value is almost constant throughout the 100 cycles. This value is relatively higher compared to the glycerolized CS-DN-NH4SCN [16], attributing to the inclusion of PVdF in the fabricating of the electrodes. As an insulator, the blended polymers inhibit electron movement in the carbonic electrons [67-69]. Kumar and Bhat [70] documented polymer blend electrolyte for supercapacitor application, and their findings have discovered that high ESR value is mainly due to the decomposition of the electrolyte in the EDLC. Fig. 8 shows the fluctuation of Cspe against cycle number for the EDLC assembly. The charge\u2013discharge (CD) response can be used to determine the Cspe of the manufactured EDLC via the following equation: CCD=ism where, i stands for the applied current, s is the gradient of the discharge area. It can be observed that the initial Cspe value at the 1st cycle is determined to be\u00a0\u223c\u00a044F/g; whereas, it increased to\u00a0\u223c\u00a049F/g once the cycle number has reached 60th cycle. Interestingly, the Cspe value is almost constant up to 100 cycles with its average value of\u00a0\u223c\u00a046F/g, showing excellent cyclic stability. The variation in the Cspe value is caused by the inhomogeneity of the electrode\u2013electrolyte region. In addition, the Cspe value changes slightly due to the variation in ionic polarization. The nearly identical Cspe magnitude was obtained from both the CV and GCD characteristic findings [71\u201373]. Other critical parameters, such as energy density (Ed) and power density (Pd) are determined to complete the EDLC device characterization using equations (14 and 15): E=CsV22 P=V24m(ESR) The Ed and Pd of the constructed EDLC as a function of cycle number are shown. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "in Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. Fig. 9 shows the Ed trend up to 100 cycles. This trend is comparable to the pattern of the Cspe in Fig. 8, where Ed increases from\u00a0\u223c\u00a04.9 Wh/kg to\u00a0\u223c\u00a05.8 Wh/kg between the 1st to 60th cycles. The steady magnitude of Ed throughout 100 cycles with its average value of\u00a0\u223c\u00a05.4 Wh/kg indicates that anions and cations experience the same energy barrier while moving toward the surface of the electrodes [74]. The Ragone plot [75] demonstrates that the energy density of SC varies between 0.05 and 20 Wh/kg. Liew et al. [76] have stated that the Ed value for their constructed EDLC was between 0.40 and 0.55 Wh/kg, which is less than the present study. The reported Ed value for the system of CMC-PVA-NH4Br was identified to be 1.19 Wh/kg [77]. The Pd value represents the amount of energy that could be provided per kilogram. Fig. 10 presents the Pd trend up to 100 cycles, which is almost constant throughout 100 cycles, averaging at 530\u00a0W/kg. The impact of ESR on the Pd output, makes them both exhibits very similar patterns. The presence of high ESR value implies the existence of inadequate gap between the electrolyte and electrodes, thereby energy cannot be transferred effectively [78]. According to the Ragone plot [75], SCs may possess a power density as high as 106 W/kg. Ragone plot is essential to comprehend and differentiate between batteries and SCs. When it comes to power density, SC overcomes batteries and fuel cells; while, it has a lower energy density. The Ed and Pd outcomes for the current constructed EDLC are lower in comparison with our previous study for the MC-DN-NH4SCN-glycerol based biopolymer blend electrolytes, which were 18.3 Wh/kg and 680\u00a0W/kg, correspondingly [79]. This could be related to the lattice energy of NH4SCN salt, which can be more easily dissociated, compared to the NH4I salt.  In conclusion, MC-DN-NH4I-glycerol electrolytes were prepared using a solution casting approach. The changes in FTIR bands and reducing their intensities upon increasing glycerol are evidence of the complexation among the electrolyte components. The highest conductivity of 3.24\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 S cm\u22121 has been achieved for the sample including 42\u00a0wt% of glycerol, with the highest carrier concentration of 3.89\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01020 extracted from the EIS fitting. The TNM techniques have established the dominancy of ions as charge carriers with the 0.952 value compared to the ignored contribution of electron species. The LSV plot revealed that the sample is stable for device application under the applied voltage of not more than 2\u00a0V. The absence of peaks in the CV profile demonstrates that the mechanism of charge storage within the produced EDLC is completely capacitive. The calculated value of Cspe from the CV plot at low scan rates is close enough to the one evaluated from the discharge diagram of the GCD figure. The calculated ESR value is in the acceptable range with good stability in overall cycles. The performance of the fabricated EDLC was found to be highly stable throughout the 100-cycle period, both in terms of Ed and Pd. Despite showing good eligibility of the current biopolymer electrolyte system for electrochemical device application, further study in the future is necessary to enhance the performance of the device through improvement of conductivity and advancing the cyclability of the device.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2021.151259.txt", "paper": ["In the past ten years, organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have greatly progressed for excellent optoelectronic properties, such as bandgap tunability, high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length and high charge carrier mobility [1\u20137]. At present, the highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been reached to 25.5% [8]. Unfortunately, there are lots of interfacial defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite film during solution-based fabrication processes. Many efforts have been made to decrease the defects density in perovskite films, such as interfacial modification engineering,[9,10] low-dimensional perovskite[11,12] and compositional engineering.[13,14] Among them, the interfacial modification engineering has been considered as an effective strategy to reduce defects density in perovskite films. The interfacial modification materials with different functional groups play an important role in solving the above interfacial problems to enhance PCE and stability of PSCs. Liu and co-workers have acquired a high open-circuit voltage (1.18\u00a0V) by employing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to modify the interface of perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD [15]. Zhang and co-workers have firstly used glucose to passivate the MAPbI3 perovskite film and obtained a high PCE up to 20.15% [16]. Zou et al have reported an anionic surfactant modifiable material, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), which can effectively enhance the PCE of perovskite devices [17]. However, these interfacial modification materials displayed a limited passivation effect, which are hard to achieve high- performance perovskite devices with satisfactory PCE and stability. Two main types of defects in perovskite films have been regard as important sources for non-radiative recombination: (1) one-dimensional (1D) point defects resulted from growth or preparation conditions, such as uncoordinated lead ion (Pb2+), FA+ and MA+ vacancies,[18\u201321] (2) two-dimensional (2D) extended defects, including surface and GBs. The 1D point defects become non-radiative recombination centers, reducing the steady-state charge density and then lowering the splitting of the quasi-Fermi level, which ultimately leads to the loss of the open circuit voltage (V oc) and weakens the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs [22,23]. The presence of the surface and a large number of GBs are the main reasons for the instability of PSCs, because the oxygen and moisture in the environment interact with the components of perovskite first from the surface or GBs [24]. Therefore, it is important to simultaneously passivate the 1D point defects by the interaction bond and the 2D extended defects via increasing grain sizes to reduce the number of GBs for achieving highly efficient and stable PSCs. In this study, we adopted a novel interfacial modification material, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBA), which was introduced the interface of perovskite film based on the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (labeled as FA0.85MA0.15) and hole transport layer (HTL). Compared to other interfacial modification materials, owing to the existence of multifunctional groups of \u2013CHO and \u2013OH and the effect of promoting the secondary growth of grains, the HBA can effectively passivate various types of defects in perovskite film, including the 1D point defects of Pb2+ and MA+/FA+ by forming coordination bond and hydrogen bond and the 2D extended defects via reducing the number of GBs. As a result, the PCE is enhanced from 18.84% to 20.89% after introducing the interfacial modifier of HBA. More importantly, the unsealed HBA-modified perovskite devices could maintain around 90% and 80% of their initial PCEs under 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% RH for 1200\u00a0h and at 85\u00a0\u00b0C for 240\u00a0h, respectively.  The formamidine iodide (FAI), methylamine bromide (MABr), lead (II) iodide (PbI2), lead (II) bromide (PbBr2) were obtained from TCI. The isopropanol (IPA), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), lithium bis (trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), titanium (diisopropoxide) bis (2,4-pentanedionate) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were gained from Aldrich. The spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Xi\u2019an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBA) was gotten from J&K Scientific. Other materials were bought from Sino pharm or Alfa and all materials were used without additional treatment. PSCs were prepared based on FTO/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/perovskite/HBA interfacial modifier/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Firstly, the devices were prepared on patterned FTO substrates, which were respectively sonicated in cleaning agent, ultra-pure water and ethanol. Then, FTO substrates were dried by the nitrogen gun and treated by UV-ozone for 10\u00a0min to remove organic residue on the surface. Next, at 450\u00a0\u00b0C, the compact TiO2 solution which included 0.5\u00a0mL of (diisopropoxide) bis (2,4-titanium pentanedionate) and 5\u00a0mL of isopropanol was sprayed on the FTO substrates by employing N2 as a carrier gas. Particularly, the substrates were heated at 450\u00a0\u00b0C for 40\u00a0min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on the surface of compact layer by spin-coating at 4000 r.p.m. for 20\u00a0s. Subsequently, the substrates were annealed at 510\u00a0\u00b0C about 30\u00a0min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were processed by the UV-ozone for 10\u00a0min and transferred into the glovebox for the following steps. 1.5\u00a0M (Pb2+) perovskite precursor solution was obtained by dissolving the stoichiometrically corresponding perovskite component powders in DMF and DMSO mixed solvent (DMF: DMSO\u00a0=\u00a04: 1 by volume). Before using it, the precursor solution was heated at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h under stirring. A typical step spin-coating method with 1100 r.p.m. for 11\u00a0s and then 4600 r.p.m. for 36\u00a0s was employed to obtain the perovskite layers in an airflow glove box (the relative humidity was maintained at about 20%). Meanwhile, chlorobenzene of about 120\u00a0\u00b5L was quickly dripped on the perovskite layer in the final 15\u00a0s. Then, the perovskite films were heated on a heating platform at 105\u00a0\u00b0C for about 30\u201340\u00a0min. Next, the 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde solutions (in IPA) with different concentrations were spin-coated on perovskite films at 3500 r.p.m. for 25\u00a0s, respectively. Then, thermal annealing for 10\u00a0min at 105\u00a0\u00b0C. After cooling to room temperature, 40\u00a0\u00b5L of hole-transport layer, which included 73.5\u00a0mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 1\u00a0mL of chlorobenzene and 29\u00a0\u00b5L of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17\u00a0\u00b5L of Li+ salt and 8\u00a0\u00b5L of Co3+ salt, was coated on the HBA interfacial modifier at 3000 r.p.m. for 30\u00a0s. Finally, around 60\u00a0nm Au was coated on the hole-transport layer via thermal evaporating under high vacuum. XRD patterns of the perovskite films were obtained by a Rigaku smartlab 9KW with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The 2\u03b8 range was 10-50\u00b0 at room temperature. A Schottky field-emission scanning electron microscope (Gemini SEM 500, Zeiss, Germany) was used to the record of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the morphologies of the perovskite films. The UV\u2013vis absorption spectra were obtained on an Ultraviolet-Vis (UV\u2013vis) spectrophotometer (U-3900H, HITACHI, Japan) and the measurement range was from 430 to 850\u00a0nm. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (excitation at 405\u00a0nm and emission at 760\u00a0nm) were measured on a Spectro fluorometer (photon technology international) with a standard 450\u00a0W Xenon CW lamp and analyzed by the software Fluorescence. EIS was tested on an Autolab analyzer (Metrohm, PGSTAT 302\u00a0N, Switzerland) in a dark box with a frequency range from 1\u00a0MHz to 1\u00a0Hz at 0.8\u00a0V. J-V curves were executed on the source meter (Keithley 2420) and the solar simulator (Enli, SS-F5-3A, 3A, 100 mW cm\u22122 illumination AM 1.5G), which was calibrated by using NREL certified silicon reference cell (SRC-2020). The devices were retained an active area of 0.09\u00a0cm2. IPCE spectra with a wavelength range from 300 to 820\u00a0nm were tested with dual Xenon/quartz halogen light source (PV Measurements, Inc), and measured in DC mode with no bias light used. The water contact angles were acquired by using the contact angle measuring instrument (DSA25E, Drop Shape Analyzer). Humidity aging tests were carried out under 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% relative humidity (RH). Temperature aging tests were implemented at 85\u00a0\u00b0C (the devices were maintained at less than 10% RH and kept in the dark.  Here, the solutions of the HBA in iso-propanol (IPA) were spin-coated on the surface of FA0.85MA0.15 perovskite film and the corresponding preparation process was displayed in Fig. 1 a. Then, we employed the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns to explore the influence of the HBA interfacial modifier with different concentrations (0, 1, 3, 5 and 15\u00a0mg/mL) on the crystallization of the FA0.85MA0.15 films (Fig. 1 b). The main diffraction peaks at around 14.2\u00b0 and 28.4\u00b0 can be attributed to (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) crystal planes of the FA0.85MA0.15 films, which has been proved in previous literature [25,26]. The strongest intensity and narrowest full width at half maximum (FWHM) value at (1 1 0) crystal plane represent the best crystallization. According to Fig. 1 c and Table S1 (supplementary Information), it is observed that the perovskite films with HBA interfacial modifier have obviously stronger peak intensities and smaller FWHM values than the control film (0\u00a0mg/mL HBA), meaning that HBA interfacial modifier is beneficial to improve the crystallization of the perovskite film. The HBA-modified (3\u00a0mg/mL) perovskite film displays the strongest intensity and smallest FWHM value than others, implying it owns the best crystal structure. Then, we exploited the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra to evaluate the function of HBA interfacial modifier on the optoelectronic properties of FA0.85MA0.15 perovskite film (Fig. 1 d). By comparing their absorption intensities, the HBA-modified perovskite films show enhanced absorption strength, which is mainly attributed to the improved film quality (improved crystallization and larger perovskite grain sizes) [27]. The HBA-modified (3\u00a0mg/mL) perovskite film owns the strongest absorption intensity. We investigated the effect of varying amounts of HBA interfacial modifier on the surface morphology of the perovskite film by using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cross-sectional SEM image of the HBA-modified perovskite film was shown in Fig. 2 a, we can clearly observe the larger grain sizes and less GBs, the main reason is that the electron pair from C\u00a0=\u00a0O bond in HBA has a strong coordination with Pb2+, which promotes the secondary growth of grains to form larger grain sizes and fewer GBs [28,29]. From top-view SEM images (Fig. 2 b-d), it is clearly seen that the control film (without HBA) exhibits the number of small grains and extremely rough surface. By contrast, there are some larger grain sizes and much smoother surface after the introduction of HBA interfacial modifier. These results proved that the HBA modifier have a positive effect on improving crystallization and surface morphology of perovskite film. To further investigate the improved performance of PSCs with the HBA interfacial modifier. We prepared the perovskite devices with various concentrations of HBA interfacial modifier based on the structure of FTO/m-TiO2/c-TiO2/perovskite/HBA interfacial modifier/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 3 a). The current\u2013voltage (J-V) curves of FA0.85MA0.15 films based on the different amounts of HBA interfacial modifier were exhibited in Fig. 3 b and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters were listed in Table 1 . The HBA-modified devices own improved photovoltaic performance, compared to the control device. The V oc, J sc, FF and PCE increase from 1.10\u00a0V, 22.32\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, 74.80% and 18.42% for the control PSC to 1.13\u00a0V, 23.23\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, 79.46% and 20.89% for the HBA-modified perovskite device, respectively. Meanwhile, a fitted histogram with a Gaussian distribution of the PCE obtained from more than 30 devices was displayed in Fig. 3 c. The average value of PCE increases from 17.24% to 19.72% after the introduction of HBA interfacial modifier. However, when the concentration of HBA is over 3\u00a0mg/mL, the device performance decreases (As shown in Fig. 3b and Table 1.), which results from the quality of the films becomes worse and too much residual photo-inactive HBA will stay at GBs and the surface of perovskite that impedes the charge transfer and leads to the formation of more defect sites with the serious non-radiative recombination. The hysteresis index (HI) of J-V curve is also an important indicator for exploring photovoltaic performance of devices. The smaller value of HI means the less interfacial charges accumulation and less non-radiative recombination. The value of HI is 0.96% for the HBA-modified device and 6.29% for the control PSC. The main reason for reduced HI is the formation of hydrogen bond between hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) and the organic cations (FA+/MA+), which reduces the interfacial charges accumulation by inhibiting the migration of organic cations and finally achieving negligible hysteresis. Detailed photovoltaic parameters and J-V curves were presented in Table S2 and Fig. 3 d. The steady-state measurements of the PCE at the maximum power point were shown in Fig. 3 e. The HBA-modified and the control perovskite devices showed the sable power output of 20.14% and 17.20% at 0.92\u00a0V and 0.90\u00a0V, respectively. Then, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were tested to calculate the J sc. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "values (Fig. 3 f), which are 22.37 and 21.41\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 for the control and HBA-modified devices and the J sc in J-V curves are 23.23 and 22.32\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, respectively. The results verify the authenticity of J sc values gained from J-V curves. Finally, we employed J sc, V oc, and FF distributions of perovskite devices to illustrate enhanced the photovoltaic performance of PSC and the corresponding statistical results were presented in Fig. 3 g-i. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra with different concentrations of HBA interfacial modifier were executed and the corresponding test results were displayed in Fig. 4 a and Fig. S1. By comparing their PL intensities, the HBA-modified (3\u00a0mg/mL) perovskite film owns lowest PL strength than others (the perovskite films were prepared on TiO2), indicating its fewest defects density and the fastest charge transport. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were exploited the interfacial charge recombination behavior of perovskite devices. The Nyquist plots of the perovskite devices were gained at a bias of 0.8\u00a0V in the frequency ranging from 1\u00a0MHz to 1\u00a0Hz in the dark as shown in Fig. 4 b. A semicircle representing carrier recombination resistance (R rec) can be seen at high frequencies,[30,31] the HBA-modified device displays a higher R rec than the control device, which implies that the HBA interfacial modifier is conducive to reducing the R rec inside the devices and results in the improved V oc [32,33]. Then, we performed the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements to accurately calculate the defect density based on devices with hole-only (glass/FTO/PEDOT: PSS/ perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) and the results were shown in Fig. 4 c. The N t values were analyzed by employing the equation: N t\u00a0=\u00a02V TFL \u03b5 0 \u03b5 r/qL2, where the meaning of V TFL, \u03b5 0, \u03b5 r, q and L represent the trap-filling limited voltage, relative dielectric constant of the FA0.85MA0.15 material, vacuum dielectric constant, elemental charge and the thickness of the film, respectively [34,35]. According to the calculation results, the hole trap densities were calculated to be 2.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 and 3.39\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 cm\u22123 for the perovskite film with and without HBA interfacial modifier, respectively. The dark J-V tests were shown in Fig. 4 d. The HBA-modified perovskite device displayed the lower leakage current (J 0) than control one, meaning less charge recombination. These results supported that the HBA interfacial modifier is beneficial to reduce defects density. Besides, to obtain deeper insight of the charge carrier recombination in the fabricated devices, the dependence of J sc and V oc on light intensity (I) were measured and the corresponding experimental results were displayed in Fig. 4 e and f. We employed the power law equation J sc\u00a0\u221d\u00a0I \u03b1 to explain the dependence of J sc on the I and the \u03b1 values are respectively 0.991 for the HBA-modified perovskite device and 0.949 for the control one. Generally, the \u03b1 more deviates from 1, implying the higher bimolecular recombination. Thus, it is found that the control PSC suffers severe bimolecular recombination at short-circuit condition, leading to the low J sc. While, the high J sc is reflected on the device with the HBA interfacial modifier. The value of n obtained from the slope of nkT/q (k, T and q mean Boltzmann's constant, temperature and charge, respectively) can well reflect the trap-assisted recombination [36,37]. The value of n is closer to 1, the trap-assisted recombination is less. Therefore, the HBA-modified device (n\u00a0=\u00a01.49) owns reduced non-radiative recombination, compared with the control PSC (n\u00a0=\u00a01.69), which means that the use of HBA as interfacial modifier can effectively suppress non-radiative recombination by passivating interfacial defects on the surface and GBs in perovskite film. At present, the environmental stability of PSCs has been also one of essential indexes for commercialization. Thus, we systematically explored the humidity and thermal stability of PSCs with and without HBA interfacial modifier. Firstly, we executed the humidity aging tests of the unsealed perovskite devices under 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% RH (at room temperature and in dark) for 1200\u00a0h and the detailed test results were shown in Fig. 5 a and Fig. S2. From the normalized PCE curves, the device with HBA modifier (3\u00a0mg/mL) has the slow degradation tendency and it still retains 90% of initial PCE after 1200\u00a0h. Unfortunately, the control device exhibits a rapid decay tend of PCE. Meanwhile, in Fig. 5 b, the perovskite films with HBA interfacial modifier still display greater UV\u2013vis absorption intensities after humidity aging for 1200\u00a0h in comparison to the control film. Furthermore, to further explore the positive effect of various concentrations of HBA interfacial modifier on improving humidity stability of the devices, the water contact angles were carried out. As shown in Fig. 5 c and Fig. S3, the HBA-modified perovskite films show contact angles of 71.5\u00b0 75.8\u00b0, 74.3\u00b0, and 70.7\u00b0, respectively. Comparatively, the control film just presents contact angle of 65.5\u00b0, indicating that the perovskite films with HBA modifier perform obviously enhanced hydrophobic properties. Then, the thermal aging tests were implemented at 85\u00a0\u00b0C for about 240\u00a0h. The normalized PCE variation curves of the unsealed perovskite devices were displayed in Fig. 5 d. The control and HBA-modified devices (3\u00a0mg/mL) respectively retain about 20% and 80% of their original PCE. Moreover, the morphology of perovskite films (Fig. 5 e) and the peak intensity of PbI2 from XRD patterns (Fig. 5 f-h) before and after thermal aging also confirm that the HBA interfacial modifier is beneficial to enhance thermal stability. The improvement of environmental stability is that the multifunctional groups (\u2013CHO and \u2013OH) of HBA can effectively passivate various types of defects and enhance the quality of perovskite film. On the other hand, the HBA could form hydrogen bond with the organic cations (FA+/MA+) in perovskite to inhibit the migration of organic cations and further enhance stability. Besides, the HBA forms a passivation layer on the surface of the perovskite, which can prevent moisture, oxygen (from environment) and small molecule additives in the HTM layer from reacting with the components of the perovskite, and finally achieving its excellent stability against humidity and thermal. According to the above results, it. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "can be clearly observed that the films with HBA interfacial modifier have better film quality and lower defect density. Thus, the HBA-modified devices show better photovoltaic performance and stability than the control one. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism and detailed reason for the passivation effect of HBA interfacial modifier are unclear. Based on the previous researches and the results of these related tests, we putted forward a possible mechanism, as shown in Fig. 6 a. Specifically, (1) in the aldehyde group (\u2013CHO), the electron pair from the C\u00a0=\u00a0O bond has a strong coordination with Pb2+, which not only significantly passivates defect of under-coordinated Pb2+, but also promotes the secondary growth of grains to obtain larger grain sizes and fewer GBs [29]. (2) In hydroxyl group (\u2013OH), the hydrogen atom could form hydrogen bond with the organic cations (FA+/MA+), which greatly reduce the charges accumulation at the interface by inhibiting the migration of organic cations and achieving negligible hysteresis. On the other hand, the \u2013OH is easier to release hydrogen due to the electron withdrawing effect of the \u2013CHO. These hydrogens can effectively terminate the degradation reaction by neutralizing reactive oxygen species and finally slow down the degradation process of perovskite to enhance stability of PSCs [38]. Obviously, the multifunctional groups in HBA play a crucial role in improving photovoltaic performance and stability of PSC via simultaneously passivate 1D point defects and 2D extended defects. To further verify the rationality of the HBA passivation mechanism we proposed, we carried out the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests as shown in Fig. 6 b-d. Firstly, the XPS of O (one main peak of O 1\u00a0s) for perovskite film with HBA modifier (3\u00a0mg/mL) has higher peak intensity than the control film (a trifling O 1\u00a0s signal from water and oxygen in the environment). meaning that the HBA with functional groups (\u2013CHO and \u2013OH) indeed was introduced in the perovskite film. The Pb signals (two main peaks of Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2), in perovskite film with HBA modifier move toward low-energy direction, verifying that the under-coordinated Pb2+ interacts with the electron pair from \u2013CHO in HBA. Besides, it is found that the N 1\u00a0s signal of the HBA-modified perovskite film obviously shifts toward low-energy direction, verifying that the \u2013OH have interactions of hydrogen bond (-O-H\u2026 N) with MA+/FA+. These results are strong evidences for the functional groups (\u2013CHO and \u2013OH) in HBA can effectively passivate kinds of 1D point defects (under-coordinated Pb2+ and MA+/FA+ vacancies) and 2D extended defects (surface and GBs) for achieving high-performance PSCs.  In summary, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with multifunctional groups (\u2013CHO and \u2013OH) as a novel interfacial modifier was employed for the first time to passivate the defects of perovskite film. The SEM and XRD test results demonstrated that the perovskite film based on FA0.85MA0.15 displays improved film quality (including smoother surface, larger grain sizes and less GBs) after the addition of HBA interfacial modifier. In addition, According to XPS spectra, we successfully proved that the functional groups (\u2013CHO and \u2013OH) in HBA can simultaneously passivate the 1D point defects of Pb2+ and MA+/FA+ by forming coordination interaction and hydrogen bond and the 2D extended defects via promoting the secondary growth of grains to reduce the number of GBs. As a result, the PCE of perovskite device with HBA modifier (3\u00a0mg/mL) is up to 20.89%, in comparison to the control device (18.42%). Moreover, the HBA-modified devices achieve improved environmental stability and negligible hysteresis. The results afford an easy but effective method to passivate defects in perovskite films for highly efficient and stable PSCs.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The poor performance mainly attributed to easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, which could induce heavy p-type self-doping and more Sn vacancies. This in turn leads to rough film morphology and serious charge carrier recombination of their thin films.[14\u201317] Controlling the fast crystallization process of tin perovskite films become a key strategy to form pinhole-free and homogeneous films.[18] To date, considerable works have been devoted to the deposition of high-quality tin perovskite films with retarded Sn2+ oxidation process such as solvent engineering,[19\u201321] additive engineering,[22\u201324] dimensional engineering[25,26] and interface engineering.[19,27,28] Our early work used high polar dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form intermediate adducts with SnI2 to retard the crystallization rate of tin halide perovskite and obtained high-quality MASnI3 (MA+ = methylammonium; CH3NH3 +) perovskite films.[29] Similarly, Chen et al. regulated the crystallization kinetics of tin perovskites with acetic acid modification into the perovskite precursors to control the supersaturation and nucleation rate.[30] Their acidic atmosphere effectively inhibited the Sn2+oxidation and reduced the defect density of the corresponding film. Moreover, Seok et al. used 2-thiophenemethylammonium iodine as a post-treat strategy in Cs0.1FA0.9SnI3 film to passivate the surface defects.[31] The residual strain gradient along the vertical direction of the perovskite film was significantly released. Recently, He et al. reported the directional growth of FASnI3 by constructing 2D/3D structures by 4-fluoro-phenethylammonium bromide with a decreased content of Sn4+ from 15.8% to 7.8%.[32] To date, crystallization modulation for tin perovskite films provides a significant channel to obtain low defect density thin perovskite films. Herein, we introduced a Lewis base thiourea (TU) into perovskite precursor to regulate the crystallization process of tin thin films. The addition of TU significantly slowed down the crystallization of tin perovskite through strong interaction between TU and SnI2, which was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. These approaches obtained high-quality perovskite films with large grains. The manipulated crystallization by TU also suppressed the defects formation and the non-radiative recombination of tin perovskite films. Consequently, the TU-modified inverted device achieved a PCE of 10.07%, which was 24% higher than the device without TU. Moreover, the unencapsulated device showed improved stability with 90% retention of the initial PCE after being stored over 1600\u00a0h in an N2 glove box.  To understand the colloidal chemistry of precursors, the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were applied to investigate the colloidal size of tin perovskite precursors (Fig. 1 a). Two peaks centered around 1.5\u00a0nm and 164.2\u00a0nm were observed in the control solution, whereas the colloidal distribution of TU-added precursor was located at around 2.3\u00a0nm and 458.7\u00a0nm, respectively. Clearly, larger clusters were presented in the target precursor. Those large sizes of embryonic clusters contributed to a better prerequisite for the development of a high-quality crystal. To analyze the effect of TU in perovskite films, we then compared the XRD patterns of perovskites with different concentrations of TU in Fig. 1b. The addition of TU enhanced the intensity of the characteristic peaks at 14.3\u00b0, 28.6\u00b0 and 43.4\u00b0, which correspond to the (1 0 0), (2 0 0) and (3 0 0) crystal planes of tin halide perovskite.[33] Meanwhile, the full width at half maxima (FWHM) along (1 0 0), (2 0 0) and (3 0 0) planes decreased with the incorporation of TU and reached a minimum value at a concentration of 0.026\u00a0mM, which indicates the better crystallinity of perovskite film (Figure S1).[34] The ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) absorption spectra in Fig. 1c showed that the introduction of TU enhanced the light absorption of perovskite film and reached a maximum at a concentration of 0.026\u00a0mM. Fig. 1d\u2013e demonstrated the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the control and target film (with a TU concentration of 0.026\u00a0mM) and it can be seen that the incorporation of TU increased the grain size of tin halide perovskite. The white dots in both films can be attributed to the existence of excess SnI2.[35] The Lewis base nature of TU could affect the crystallization rate of perovskite and increase the grain size through strong interaction with SnI2.[36] To acquire more information about the interaction between TU and perovskite, we compared the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the TU and TU\u2013SnI2 (Fig. 2 a). It is revealed that the stretching vibration of the C\u00a0=\u00a0S bond (732.91\u00a0cm\u22121) in TU shifted to 698.19\u00a0cm\u22121 in TU\u2013SnI2. The shifted signal to low wavenumber indicates a weakening of the C\u00a0=\u00a0S bond interaction, possibly due to the chemical interaction between TU and SnI2.[37,38] In addition, the N-H bond shifted toward lower wavenumbers, indicating a hydrogen bond may be formed with I\u2013.[39] Meanwhile, the XRD results on the powder samples showed a new peak emerged at 20.9\u00b0, thus implying that an intermediate phase of SnI2-TU may be present in the powder samples (Figure S2). In Fig. 2b, the XPS spectra showed two main peaks 486.5\u00a0eV and 495.0\u00a0eV for 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Sn2+, respectively. The introduction of TU shifted the binding energy to 486.1\u00a0eV and 494.6\u00a0eV, respectively. Such a shift around 0.4\u00a0eV toward lower binding energy could be attributed to the interaction between TU and SnI2. Moreover, the content of Sn4+ was reduced in the target film (Table S1), probably due to the introduction of TU making the perovskite films. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "more homogeneous and inhibited the invasion of moisture and oxygen into the films to oxidize Sn2+.[40] The peaks of C\u00a0=\u00a0N and C\u2013NH3 + both shifted compared to the control films, most likely attributed to the presence of C\u00a0=\u00a0S and C\u2013N in TU (Figure S3 and Table S2). The intermediate phase SnI6 4\u2013-TU affects the nucleation process of perovskite through coordination with the Lewis base functional group in TU, and the regulated crystallization process yields high-quality perovskite films. To explore the photovoltaic performance of TPSCs, inverted p-i-n devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag were fabricated (Fig. 3 a). Devices with different concentrations of TU were compared and the results were shown in Figure S4 and summarized in Table S3. The current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) curves in the forward scan for the champion device were illustrated in Fig. 3a. The control device got a PCE of 8.10%, with a short-circuit current (J sc) of 21.55\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, an open-circuit voltage (V oc) of 0.59\u00a0V, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.46%. The target device achieved a PCE of 10.07%, with a J sc of 22.02\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, a V oc of 0.63\u00a0V, and a FF of 72.26%. It is obvious the PCE increase most come from the significant improvements in V oc and FF. Our approach showed great PCE enhancement in TPSCs with PC61BM ETL through Lewis-base strategy as shown in Table S4. Furthermore, Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for both devices and the integrated J int were 21.09\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and 21.71\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 for the control and target device, respectively, thus verifying the reliability of the J\u2013V results. Fig. 3c illustrates the steady-state power output for the control and target device at the maximum power point (MPP) for 150\u00a0s. The target device showed a stable J sc of 18.74\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and a PCE of 9.37% at a bias voltage of 0.50\u00a0V, which was substantially higher than the J sc of 16.15\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and PCE of 7.80% for the control device (at a bias voltage of 0.48\u00a0V). In addition, 25 independent devices were fabricated to check the reproducibility of our devices. The target device showed superior repeatability (Fig. 3d). The improvement in PCE is mainly attributed to V oc and FF (Figure S5). Considering that the oxidation issue is one of the most important challenges limiting the efficiency of TPSCs, we further tested the PCE decay of unencapsulated TPSCs in an N2 environment, as shown in Fig. 3e. The target device retained 90% of the initial PCE when stored for over 1600\u00a0h, whereas the control device dropped to only 73% of the original PCE. A slight increase in PCE of the devices at the initial stage is probably attributed to the lattice strain relaxation of the perovskite.[41,42] The water contact angles of control and target perovskite films were shown in Figure S6. Compared to the control film, the target film showed improved hydrophobicity, which would be beneficial to the stability of the perovskite film. To investigate the carrier excitation and recombination process in the TPSCs, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were characterized as depicted in Fig. 4 a-b. It was observed that the target film showed stronger PL intensity than the control film and an average PL decay lifetime (\u03c4ave) of 10.58\u00a0ns, which was 30% higher than that of the control film (8.15\u00a0ns, Table S5). This result indicated that the target perovskite film had fewer defects and was less involved in non-radiative recombination.[43] The dependence of V oc versus light intensities (from the range of 3.98 to 100 mW cm\u22122) was further illustrated to study the charge recombination process in TPSCs (Fig. 4c) by the equation: Voc=nkBTln(I)/q+constant where the slope deviates from k B T/q (k B, T, and q is Boltzmann constant, temperature and electric charge, respectively), the trap-assisted recombination is involved in the device.[8] The results showed a suppressive effect on trap-state recombination in the target device with a slope of 1.58 k B T/q compared to 1.92 k B T/q for the control device. The space charge-limited current (SCLC) model was further used to quantify the trap-state density in perovskite films. Electron-only devices were fabricated, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4d. At different bias voltages, the J-V curve can be divided into 3 regions, n\u00a0=\u00a01 for the ohmic region, n\u00a0greater than\u00a03 for the trap-fill limit (TFL) region, and n\u00a0=\u00a02 for the child region. The trap-state density (N t) can be calculated using the trap-filled limit voltage (V TFL) equation: Nt=2\u03b5\u03b50VTFLeL2 where V TFL, e, \u03b5 0, \u03b5, L represent the starting voltage at the trap-filled limit, elemental charge, vacuum capacitance (8.8542\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214F cm\u22121), relative dielectric constant (\u223c35) and thickness of the perovskite film, respectively.[22,44] As tabulated in Table S6, the target device exhibited a much lower V TFL of 0.10\u00a0V with a N t of 4.30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 cm\u22123, while the control device had a V TFL of 0.16\u00a0V with a N t of 6.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015 cm\u22123. This demonstrated that regulation of the crystallization process of tin halide perovskite through the addition of TU reduced the defect density in perovskite films, most likely owing to the improved film quality and high crystallinity. The electron mobility (\u03bc e) was further investigated by photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) method in Fig. 5 a-5b with a scaffold of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PC61BM/Ag according to the equation: \u03bce=2d23Atmax2[1+0.36\u0394j/j(0)]if\u0394j<j(0) where d, A, t max, \u0394j, and j(0) correspond to device thickness, extraction ramp, the time at the maximum extraction current, the maximum extraction peak, and displacement current, respectively. The target device showed a faster t max than the control device. The calculated \u03bc e for the target device was 2.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 cm\u22122 V\u22121 s\u22121, which is over 2 times higher compared to the control device (1.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 cm\u22122 V\u22121 s\u22121) under 100 mW cm\u22122 light intensity. (other \u03bc e under different light intensities were displayed in Figure S7 and Table S7) Mott-Schottky (M\u2212S) analysis utilizing the capacitance\u2013voltage (C-V) measurements were performed to explicitly characterize the trap-state density in these devices (Fig. 5c) according to the equation: 1C2=2Vbi-VA2e\u03b5\u03b50Nd where C, A, V,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "e, \u03b5 0, \u03b5, N d, and V bi are the measured capacitance, active area (0.096\u00a0cm2), applied bias voltage, elementary charge, vacuum capacitance, relative dielectric constant, free carrier concentration, the energy barrier of the heterojunction, respectively.[45] The flat-band potential (V bi) was obtained from the x-axis intercept of the Mott-Schottky curve with a straight line.[46] For the control and target devices, the V bi was 0.37\u00a0V and 0.47\u00a0V, respectively. Empirically, a larger V bi contributes to the separation of photogenerated carriers and the suppression of the electron-hole recombination. The doping carrier density of the control device (4.12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 cm\u22123) is higher than that of the target device (3.28\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 cm\u22123). The dark J-V of the devices in Figure S8 demonstrated the lower background carrier density and leakage current in the target device. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed under dark conditions to estimate the charge recombination of control and target devices. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the inset showed that the equivalent model is made up of series resistance (R s), a charge recombination resistor (R rec) and a recombination capacitance (C rec) of the device. According to the fitting results, the target devices had a larger R rec (14.1 K\u03a9) relative to the control devices (11.4 K\u03a9), indicating that charge recombination was inhibited in the target devices, which is consistent with the improved V oc (Table S8). To further understand the carrier dynamics in corresponding TPSCs, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements for both devices as shown in Fig. 5e-f. The photovoltage decay time increased from 5.33\u00a0\u03bcs for the control device to 16.16\u00a0\u03bcs for the target device and the photocurrent decay time decreased from 2.46\u00a0\u03bcs (control device) to 0.77\u00a0\u03bcs (target device), respectively. This result confirmed the introduction of TU effectively reduced carrier recombination and improved carrier extraction in TPSCs.  In conclusion, a Lewis base of TU was applied to regulate the crystallization process of tin halide perovskite by forming an intermediate phase SnI2-TU, resulting in high-quality lead-free perovskite films. Using photoluminescence and a serial carrier dynamics analysis, it was confirmed that the introduction of TU promoted the charge extraction and suppressed non-radiative recombination in the TPSCs. The PCE of TPSCs was boosted from 8.10% to 10.07%. In addition, the target device maintained 90% of the original efficiency after being stored under an N2 atmosphere for more than 1600\u00a0h, better than 73% retention for the control device. Since the regulated coordination environment and crystallization process facilitates the preparation of high-quality tin halide perovskite films, we believe this work will provide a promising path for the development of more-efficient TPSCs.

Compared with the traditional hole injection layer (HIL) of polyethylene dioxythiophene: polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS), recently, inorganic HIL of NiO has shown a great advantage owning to its high work function, low-hole injection barrier, good carrier transportation capability as well as excellent long-term stability [4\u20137]. Actually, during the preparation of NiO, some defects such as nickel vacancies and interstitial oxygen in the lattice of NiO often deviates the composition of nickel and oxygen from stoichiometric ratio (1:1). When the nickel-oxygen ratio is less than 1, the excess oxygen in the lattice will promote the formation of Ni3+ to make it a p-type semiconductor [8\u201311]. In order to improve the quantum efficiency of the device, it is necessary to make some surface modification or post-processing in the process of NiO film preparation to improve its conductivity [1,12\u201314]. For example, Liu [15] et al. regulated the surface morphology, carrier mobility and stoichiometric ratio of NiO by different annealing temperatures and different ultraviolet ozone treatment time. It was found that NiOOH dipole formed on the surface of NiO after ultraviolet ozone treatment, as a result, the vacuum level position of inorganic-organic interface move relatively, which helped to reduce the hole injection barrier in organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). On the other hand, ultraviolet ozone treatment can improve the wettability of NiO film surface, thereby enhancing its adhesion with adjacent luminescent layers. Further, Liu [16] et al. reported that the formation of NiOOH dipole can make the exciton recombination region far away from the surface of the NiO HTL to reduce the roll-down of OLED efficiency. Sasi [17] et al. found that the crystalline structure will change from Ni2O3 to NiO with the increase of annealing temperature. Kim [18] et al. irradiated the copper-doped nickel acetate thin film with ultraviolet ozone as HTL in perovskite solar cells. It was found that the conductivity and the carrier concentration of nickel acetate thin film increased from 4.28\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 S cm\u22121 and 3.53\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 cm\u22123 to 5.66\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122 S cm\u22121 and 2.41\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01016 cm\u22123, respectively, due to the increase of Ni2+ vacancies after ultraviolet ozone irradiation. Nickel acetate film forms a surface dipole, leading to the work function increases from 4.95\u00a0eV to 5.33\u00a0eV. Olson [19] et al. reported NiO thin films prepared by pulsed excitation deposition using oxygen plasma surface treatment. The effects of different power and treatment time on the NiO work function were investigated. Finally, the NiO thin films were applied in solar cells to improve the filling factor of devices to reduce the series resistance of devices. Armstrong [20] team also used ozone plasma to treat NiO and found that there was a dipolar NiOOH on the surface instead of Ni2O3, which increased the surface bandgap of NiO from 3.1\u00a0eV to 3.6\u00a0eV. The surface modified NiO can be used in organic thin film solar cells both to reduce leakage current and increase open circuit voltage. Due to the exsistence of interstitial oxygen and nickel vacancies, some Ni2+ ions will be oxidized to Ni3+ to maintain the electrical neutrality near nickel vacancies. Therefore, oxygen partial pressure has a great influence on the properties of NiO films. For example, Greiner [21] et al. reported that NiO is a nickel vacancy-dominated semiconductor, so its holes concentration depends on oxygen partial pressure in the preparation process. It was pointed out that the work function of NiO prepared in air and oxygen-poor atmosphere was only 5.2\u00a0eV\u20135.6\u00a0eV due to surface hydroxylation, while it was 6.7\u00a0eV in ozone atmosphere. Under high vacuum and low oxygen partial pressure, nickel vacancies are difficult to form, resulting in poor conductivity of NiO thin films. Bawendi [22] et al. used radio frequency magnetron sputtering to obtain p-type NiO thin films with adjustable resistance by controlling the relative partial pressure of oxygen and argon. The higher the partial pressure of oxygen, the lower the resistance of the prepared NiO thin films, for example, when the partial pressure ratio of oxygen to argon increases from 2.5% to 10%, the resistivity of NiO thin films decreases from 5\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm to 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 \u03a9 cm. In summary, it has been reported that excess oxygen plays a key role to improve the conductivity of the films. The excess oxygen formed in NiO lattice can cause non-stoichiometry. Ordinarily, there are two kinds of excess oxygen in NiO lattice, i.e. substituting for oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen. Both of these oxygen defects are beneficial to increase the concentration of holes and the conductivity of NiO film. In this work, NiO nanocrystals were prepared and applied as the hole injection layer of red QLED. NiO films were treated by ultraviolet ozone for different time and annealed in different atmosphere. The carrier mobility and work function of NiO were adjusted by changing the content of nickel vacancies on the surface and the type of oxygen adsorbed. It was found that with the increase of ozone treatment time, the roughness of the films increased, however, the resistivity of the films decreased due to the increase of Ni2O3 phase. The resistivity of films annealed in air was lower than that of those annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere. The corresponding QLED performance improved to a certain extent as well.  All the reagents used in the experiments were in analytic grade (purchased from Aldrich Company) and used without further purification. Quartz substrate or indium tin oxide (ITO) (10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0mm3) was employed as the substrate, which was pre-cleaned ultrasonically in ethanol, acetone, and distilled water for 30\u00a0min, respectively. NiO NCs was fabricated by a sovothermal method using nickel acetylacetonate as solute and tert-butyl alcohol as solvent at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0h [23]. NiO NCs (1\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121 in alcohol) was coated on the ITO substrate by a spin-coating technique at the rotation speed of 3000\u00a0rpm, followed by an ultraviolet ozone, air or nitrogen anneal treatment. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for different times. The thickness of the NiO film measured by ellipsometry is\u00a0~\u00a020\u00a0nm. The coated substrates were then transferred to a N2-filled glove-box for spin-coating of the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs, and ZnO NCs layers. The spin speed for QD emitter layer (15\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121, toluene) and ZnO HTL (30\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121, ethanol) were 2000\u00a0rpm and 3000\u00a0rpm, respectively, followed by annealing at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. These multilayer samples were then loaded into a custom high-vacuum chamber (pressure, ~4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 Pa) to deposit the top Al cathode (100\u00a0nm thick) patterned by an in-situ shadow mask to form an active device area of 4\u00a0mm2. Finally, The QLEDs devices surface were encapsulated by UV curing adhesive and covered with a thin slide glass to isolate from the oxygen and water in air. The structure diagram of the QLED is shown in Fig. 1 . The samples were characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM) (Nanoscope 3d, Veeco Digital Instruments) by a tapping mode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained with a Kratos AXIS-ULTRA XPS equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (Al K\u03b1). For all XPS measurements, the binding energy was calibrated against C1s at 284.8\u00a0eV. The sample surface was not etched by ion beam sputtering. The carrier mobility, carrier concentration and resistivity of NiO films were tested by Hall effect measurements (Ecopia, HMS-5500). Agilent 4255C equipped with a calibrated Newport silicon photo detector was used to measure the current-luminance-voltage characteristics. The devices were measured under ambient conditions. The electroluminescence spectra were recorded using an Ocean Optics high-resolution spectrometer (HR4000). Typically, two parallel QLED devices were tested with 8 points (one sample with four points) to make a statistical analysis with error bars.  Fig. 2 is the AFM image of NiO films treated with ultraviolet ozone for different time. NiO films treated with ultraviolet ozone for 0\u00a0min, 5\u00a0min, 10\u00a0min and 20\u00a0min are marked as sample a, b, c and d, respectively. It can be seen that, there are some small pinholes on the surface of the film with the increase of ultraviolet ozone treatment time. The surface root mean square (RMS) roughness of the film increases significantly from 0.314\u00a0nm to 0.441\u00a0nm, 0.469\u00a0nm and 1.37\u00a0nm. However, the size of the particles does not change distinctly, indicating that ultraviolet ozone treatment will lead to changes in the surface microstructures of NiO films. Especially for the sample d treated for 20\u00a0min, there are some obvious particle dispersion phenomena on the surface. The density and homogeneity of the surface decrease sharply as well. In order to investigate the effect of nickel vacancies both on the conductivity of NiO films and the performance of QLED, the prepared NiO films are annealed for 30\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C in air and in nitrogen (glove box), respectively. Fig. 3 shows the AFM images of NiO annealed in nitrogen and air. The surface of NiO films annealed in air (Fig. 3a) is rougher than that of films annealed in nitrogen (Fig. 3b). The RMS roughness of the two films is 0.16\u00a0nm and 0.10\u00a0nm, respectively. This may be due to the fact that oxygen in air promotes more interstitial oxygen and nickel vacancy on NiO surface during annealing process, leading to the increase roughness of the NiO films to a certain extent, which is also consistent with the conclusion that the surface roughness of NiO films increased by ultraviolet ozone treatment. Fig. 4 shows the O1s XPS spectra of NiO films treated by ultraviolet ozone for different time. It can be seen from the fitted graphs that the relative intensity of Ni2O3 and NiO peaks in NiO films increases clearly with the prolongation of ultraviolet ozone treatment time, and the relative molar ratio of Ni2O3 to NiO increases from 0.42:1 to 0.68:1, 1.03:1, to 2.37:1, indicating that the molar content of Ni3 + in NiO lattice can be increased by prolonging the ozone treatment time properly. We consider that the oxidation reaction between ozone and NiO phase in NiO lattice takes place under ultraviolet irradiation as follows, 2NiO+O3\u2192h\u03bdNi2O3+O2 As a result, the amount of Ni2O3 phase increased. The content of nickel oxide hydroxide (NiOOH) increases to a certain extent as well. NiOOH, as a dipolar, can change the surface dipole of the film to make the vacuum level of the organic-inorganic interface move relatively, thus improving the hole injection efficiency to reduce the leakage current of the device [24]. In addition, excessive O extends the crystal outward by increasing the extra O position. According to the principle of electric neutrality, each additional O must be balanced by generating the corresponding Ni position [25]. The reaction equation is as follows, 13O3(NiO)\u2192h\u03bdOo+VNi2-+2h+ i.e., the normal Ni2+ ions are removed, so each Ni vacancy needs to carry two effective negative charges, expressed as VNi2-. Each additional O requires two electrons, which will be obtained from another NiO lattice to produce an oxygen vacancy Oo and two positive holes h+, eventually leading to the increase of the holes concentration. Ratcliff [20] et al. reported that the work function, energy gap width (Eg) and ionization energy (IE) of NiO treated by ozone plasma increased from 4.7\u00a0eV, 3.1\u00a0eV and 5.2\u00a0eV to 5.3\u00a0eV, 3.6\u00a0eV and 5.7\u00a0eV, respectively. This result is the same as that of increasing the work function of NiO by prolonging the solvothermal reaction time to move the Fermi level to the deep level. As the solvothermal reaction time increases, the relative intensity of Ni2O3 and NiO peaks in NiO increases significantly, that is, the molar content of Ni3+ in NiO films increases, and the content of NiOOH increases to a certain extent [26], which has been confirmed by XPS analysis in Fig. 4. Therefore, we believe that prolonging the solvothermal reaction time and increasing the ultraviolet ozone treatment time are two effective ways to enhance the work function of NiO. Further, the increase of NiOOH amount can improve the surface wettability of NiO films as well [27], thereby enhancing the binding force with PVK layer to improve holes injection. As nickel is a transition metal element, its ions are easy to change. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "valence, so the formation of Ni3+ ions is unstable. The following electron transfer occurs easily in the lattice of NiO film [28,29]: Ni3++Ni2+\u21d4Ni2++Ni3+ The above process is equivalent to the transfer of bivalent and trivalent ions of nickel and to the propagation of a hole, which is the main conductive path of holes in intrinsic NiO thin films. Fig. 5 shows the O1s XPS of NiO thin films annealed in different atmospheres. The XPS peaks were divided and fitted by origin software to automatically deduct background. The relative intensity of Ni2O3 and NiO peaks in NiO films decreases significantly in nitrogen atmosphere. The relative molar ratio of Ni2O3 to NiO decreases from 0.42:1 to 0.13:1, indicating that annealing in nitrogen atmosphere can reduce the molar content of Ni3+ in NiO films. We believe that the decomposition reaction of Ni2O3 phase in NiO occurs in the nitrogen atmosphere (oxygen-poor atmosphere) [30]. 2Ni2O3\u2192N24NiO+O2 As a result, the amount of Ni2O3 phase decreases and the content of NiO phase increases. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between current density and voltage, luminance and voltage of NiO-based QLED with different ultraviolet ozone treatment time. The QLEDs device assembled by NiO film treated by ultraviolet ozone with 0, 5\u00a0min, 10\u00a0min and 20\u00a0min is defined as device a, device b, device c and device d, respectively. The luminance of the device b and c is obviously higher than that of the device a, indicating that the QLED performance can be significantly improved by appropriate time ultraviolet ozone treatment to the NiO film, while the luminance of the device d decreased, which may be that the long time ozone treatment increase the surface roughness of the NiO film to increase the leakage current of the device. Therefore, the current of device d also decreases significantly compared with that of device b and device c. The specific data are shown in Table 1 . Yang [31] reported that a smooth and compact transport interface can provide more effective carrier transport channels and reduce leakage current in the low voltage region. On the contrary, there are many protrusions on the rough surface of the transport interface, leading to a large leakage current, Joule heat or short circuit of the device. In Fig. 7 , it can be seen that the maximum current efficiency and power efficiency of device c are obtained, which may be related to the slower roll-off of efficiency at high current density. The carrier mobility and carrier concentration of NiO film also increased to a certain extent, while the resistivity decreased. Among them, sample c treated with ozone for 10\u00a0min obtained the maximum carrier mobility and concentration. The EQE of device c is lower than those of device a and device b due to the excessive increase of current density, resulting in some carriers flowing directly through the device instead of effectively forming excitons. However, the current efficiency of device d decreases dramatically. The surface roughness of NiO films will increase and the leakage current of the devices will also increase by ozone treatment for a long time. Further, the formation of excessive NiOOH will enhance the exciton quenching effect of the NiO films and greatly reduce the current efficiency [16]. In addition, because the batches of synthesizing NiO NCs are different from the previous section, and the batches of synthesizing and purifying red light quantum dots are different from the previous section as well, there will be some errors in the measurement of QLED performance data in different batches, so the data comparison is only compared with the batches of samples. J-V and L-V curves of NiO-based QLED in different annealing atmospheres are shown in Fig. 8 a. The current density and luminance of QLED annealed in air are higher than those in nitrogen, corresponding to 26953\u00a0cd\u00a0m\u22122, 472.3\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, 22145\u00a0cd\u00a0m\u22122 and 358.2\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, respectively. On the contrary, the open voltage decreases to a certain extent. Fig. 8b shows the relationship between current efficiency and luminance. The current efficiency of NiO-based QLED annealed in air is better than that of corresponding QLED in nitrogen atmosphere, corresponding to 6.1\u00a0cd A\u22121 and 4.5\u00a0cd A\u22121, respectively, as shown in Table 3. The Hall effect measurements is applied to explore the different performance of NiO-based QLED annealed under different atmospheres. The resistivity of NiO films annealed under air is significantly lower than that in nitrogen, and the specific performance parameters should be 2.61\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 \u03a9 cm and 8.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 \u03a9 cm, respectively, as shown in Table 2 . In air, free oxygen in air will adsorb on the surface of NiO to form alternative adsorbed oxygen, which will be decomposed into oxygen vacancy during annealing [32], 12O2\u21d4O0+2h++VNi2- The decomposition equilibrium constant K is K=[h+]2[VNi2-][OO]pO21/2 It denotes concentration and oxygen partial pressure. Because of the small change in stoichiometry, the value is basically a constant. Therefore, a new constant Kn can be generalized Table 3 , Kn=[h+]2[VNi2-]pO21/2 According to the principle of charge balance, each vacancy in NiO lattice will generate two holes, [VNi2-]=12[h+] With this alternative, the Kn can be expressed as, Kn=[h+]32pO21/2 Therefore, the void concentration can be expressed as [h+]=(2Kn)1/3pO21/6 Therefore, the hole concentration [h+] and conductivity are proportional to the 1/6 power of oxygen partial pressure, \u03c3\u221d[h+]\u221dpO21/6 Therefore, the conductivity increases with the increase of oxygen partial pressure, which is why the resistivity of NiO thin films annealed in air is lower than that in nitrogen. The formation of nickel vacancies can improve the conductivity of NiO thin films. On the contrary, in nitrogen atmosphere, nickel vacancies are difficult to generate, resulting in poor conductivity of NiO thin films, which makes their QLED performance worse than the corresponding QLED in air atmosphere. For the formation of interstitial oxygen: 12O2\u21d4Oi2-+2h+ The same relationship between conductivity and oxygen partial pressure can also be obtained.  The effects of ultraviolet ozone treatment for different time and annealing atmosphere on the surface morphology, resistivity of NiO films and the electroluminescence performance of corresponding red QLED were investigated. The results show that the surface roughness and conductivity. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of NiO films treated by ultraviolet ozone and annealed in air are higher than those of NiO films without ultraviolet ozone treatment and annealed in nitrogen. The luminance and current efficiency increase from 17260\u00a0cd\u00a0m\u22122 and 1.57\u00a0cd\u00a0m\u22122 to 25836\u00a0cd\u00a0m\u22122 and 6.05\u00a0cd A\u22121, respectively. The improved performance of QLED is mainly attributed to the increase of interstitial oxygen and nickel vacancy content on the surface of the NiO film under oxygen-rich conditions. The effect of ultraviolet ozone treatment for 10\u00a0min achieves the optimal result.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Unfortunately, the hydrogen generation efficiency of this energy conversion process is largely impeded by the unfavorable reaction thermodynamics (1.23\u00a0V) and slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode [4\u20136]. Replacing the OER with anodic organic oxidation reaction to couple the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been newly developed as a thermodynamic favorable strategy toward hydrogen generation with less energy consumption [7\u201312]. Among them, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR, CO(NH2)2\u00a0+\u00a06OH\u2212\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N2\u00a0+\u00a05H2O\u00a0+\u00a0CO2\u00a0+\u00a06e\u2212) affords a relatively low theoretical potential (0.37\u00a0V), which is a desirable alternative anodic reaction for energy-saving hydrogen production [13\u201316]. However, the high-performance electrocatalysts with dual HER and UOR functionalities in urea-rich electrolyte are still highly required, which is crucial for practical applications. Nonprecious nickel-based transition metal electrocatalysts such as hydroxides [17], oxides [18], sulfides [19], phosphides [20], and nitrides [21] have been currently considered as typical electrochemically active materials for UOR electrocatalysis. In general, in situ formed high valance state Ni species in these electrocatalytic systems are identified as the catalytically active sites. To further improve the UOR performances, it is indispensable for the fine modulation of the intermediate absorption behaviors of catalytically active sites via heterostructure construction. Particularly, Ni-Mo-based heterogeneous electrocatalysts integrate the merits of HER and UOR-active components and realize excellent electrocatalytic performances for urea electrolysis [22]. For example, NiS@Ni3S2/NiMoO4 heterostructure has a tailored surface charge state of NiMoO4, facilitating urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution [23]. NiMoO4\u00b7xH2O-derived Ni/NiO/MoOx heterostructure was found to behave Pt-like HER activity and excellent UOR performance in alkaline electrolytes, providing a quite low cell voltage of 1.38\u00a0V at a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 [24]. Likely, the hierarchical Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N heterostructure nanorods achieved energy-saving urea electrolysis for hydrogen generation, exhibiting an ultralow cell voltage of 1.348\u00a0V at 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 and remarkable long-term stability over 500\u00a0h [25]. Therefore, it is promising to explore novel hierarchical structures of highly efficient and cost-effective NiMo-based electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen generation. Conventional urea electrolysis process for hydrogen generation generally requires external power sources. It is interestingly proposed a new integrated system through combination of renewable energy generator (REGs) and urea electrolyzer to achieve high-efficiency energy storage and conversion, which is essential for the future use of renewable sources to produce fuels. Recently, solar cell has been employed as a REG to drive urea electrolysis. For example, the safe production of green hydrogen was demonstrated in N-doped NiFeOOH nanosheets [26] and NiMoO4 nanorods [27] based urea electrolyzer that was driven by a solar-powered photovoltaic panel. It is worth mentioning that solar photothermal pathway is another important manner for utilizing and converting solar energy, which is more affordable in comparison with photovoltaic methods. A question naturally arise from this perspective: can the electricity generated by solar-to-thermal conversion effectively drive urea electrolysis? Despite these advances on self-powered electrocatalytic processes, it is still challenging and imperative to explore the novel REGs-integrated urea electrolyzer for green hydrogen generation. Inspired by our recent investigations on semiconductor-based electrocatalytic systems with dual functions of photothermal and electroactive units [28,29], we herein present an ingeniously integrated system that combines a solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) and a urea electrolyzer to achieve energy-efficient hydrogen production from solar thermal power generation. This integrated system is realized by using a multifunctional heterostructure of MoO2 coupled sulfur-incorporated NiMoO4 (S-NiMo/NF). As the solar photothermal conversion unit, the plasmonic MoO2 in S-NiMo/NF exhibits excellent solar-to-thermal behavior that integrates thermoelectric (TE) module for efficient electricity generation; while S-NiMo/NF can also acts the electroactive electrode to promote electrocatalytic processes of HER, OER and urea electrolysis. Excitingly, the four-series connected S-NiMo/NF-STEGs achieve the self-powered hydrogen production from urea electrolysis. The hydrogen production rate reach 2.68\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0min\u22121 in S-NiMo/NF-based solar thermoelectric urea electrolysis system when irradiated by solar light at intensity of 5 sun.  Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT, (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2\u00b76H2O), thioacetamide, urea, potassium hydroxide (KOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanol were purchased from Macklin (Shanghai, China). All the chemicals in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification. A piece of NF (3\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0cm) was first ultrasonically cleaned by 3.0\u00a0M HCl, ethanol and deionized water for 15\u00a0min each. The photothermal S-NiMo/NF electrode was fabricated through a simple one-pot solvothermal process. In a typical procedure, 0.7131\u00a0g NiCl2\u00b76H2O, 1.2358\u00a0g (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O and 0.5409\u00a0g thioacetamide were dissolved in 70\u00a0mL deionized water, and then poured into 100\u00a0mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave with a piece of pretreated NF, which was sealed and heated at 180\u00a0\u00b0C in an oven for 12\u00a0h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the obtained electrode was rinsed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and then dried in vacuum at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. For comparison, the Mo-free S-Ni/NF and S-free NiMo/NF electrodes were also synthesized under similar procedure in the absence of (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O and thioacetamide, respectively. The phase structures of the electrodes were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab 9\u00a0K) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. Raman spectroscopy of the electrodes was collected on a confocal microscope Raman system (Witec alpha300 access) with a 532\u00a0nm laser source. The surface morphologies of the electrodes were observed by a field scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Gemini 500 and Sigma-300). The microstructures of electrocatalysts scraped from S-NiMo/NF electrodes were examined by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was analyzed by a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray source. The broadband optical spectroscopy of S-NiMo/NF was measured by an ultraviolet\u2013visible-near infrared (UV\u2013VIS-NIR) spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) with an attached integrating sphere. The infrared thermal images of the photothermal electrodes were captured by an infrared camera (FLIR ONE Pro). The surface temperatures of photothermal electrode were monitored in real-time by a k-type thermometer (ATEST DT-847UD). S-NiMo/NF integrated thermoelectric generator was fabricated by placing a piece of photothermal S-NiMo/NF on the hot side of the commercial thermoelectric (TE) module (TES1-12704, 3\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0cm), while the cold side temperature of TE module was controlled at 25\u00a0\u00b0C by. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the water circulation to realize the desirable temperature difference to generate electricity. The open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc) and I-V curves of S-NiMo/NF integrated thermoelectric generator under irradiation of a 300\u00a0W xenon lamp (ceAuLight CEL-HXF300) with an AM 1.5G filter were measured by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua) in two-electrode configuration. Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a typical three-electrode configuration with an as-fabricated electrode as working electrode, an Hg/HgO (1.0\u00a0M KOH) as reference electrode and a graphite rod as counter electrode using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua). The 1.0\u00a0M KOH solutions with or without 0.33\u00a0M urea were served the electrolyte for UOR and OER tests, respectively. The measured potentials were converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in terms of Nernst equation: ERHE\u00a0=\u00a0EHg/HgO\u00a0+\u00a00.059\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0pH\u00a0+\u00a00.098. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded at a scan rate of 5\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121 from high to low potentials for UOR and OER to eliminate possible interferences of the catalyst oxidation peak with the potential onset. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested in a frequency range of 106 to 10\u22121 Hz at the applied potentials. Chronopotentiometric curve was measured at a fixed current density of 50\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122.  Fig. 1 a schematically illustrates the fabrication procedure of the S-NiMo/NF by a simple one-pot hydrothermal strategy. In such synthesis process, the AMT introduced as a molybdenum source reacts with Ni2+ to form NiMoO4, and excess AMT can be further converted into MoO2 under hydrothermal condition in the presence of thioacetamide [30\u201335]. Meanwhile, thioacetamide as a sulfur source facilitates the simultaneous realization of S dopants and oxygen vacancies [36,37]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to understand the crystalline phase evolution during the synthesis processes. In the absence of AMT, the Ni2+ directly reacted with thioacetamide to form Ni3S2 on NF skeleton. As shown in Fig. 1b, except for the three sharp peaks of NF substrate at 44.4\u00b0, 51.7\u00b0, and 76.3\u00b0, the other prominent peaks are well indexed to cubic phase of Ni3S2 (PDF#44-1418). It is interestingly observed that the excess AMT introduced into above synthetic system leads to the complete change in crystalline phase (Fig. 1c). The four new peaks appeared at 36.3\u00b0, 41.3\u00b0, 53.4\u00b0 and 65.1\u00b0 corrsponding to the (1\u00a00\u00a00), (1\u00a00\u00a01), (1\u00a00\u00a02) and (1\u00a01\u00a00) planes of hexagonal MoO2 (PDF#50-0739). There is no other peaks belonging to NiMoO4, suggesting the low content or amorphous nature of the formed NiMoO4 [37]. Comparative experimental result depicts that the mixed phases of hydrous NiMoO4 (PDF#13-0128) and MoO3\u00b70.33H2O (PDF#54-1013) were formed on the surface of NF by reacting Ni2+ with excess AMT in the absence of thioacetamide (Fig. S1, Supporting Information), suggesting the critical role of thioacetamide for the formation of hexagonal MoO2 and amorphous hydrous NiMoO4 in S-NiMo/NF. Raman spectroscopy was analyzed to further probe the crystal structure of the as-fabricated S-NiMo/NF, as shown in Fig. 1d. The Mo-free S-Ni/NF displays the characteristic bands at 302, 322, and 350\u00a0cm\u22121 of Ni3S2 [38,39]. Intriguingly, the Raman spectrum of S-NiMo/NF is completely different from that of S-Ni/NF. The strong bands at 816, 889 and 938\u00a0cm\u22121 are assigned to the Mo-O vibration modes in NiMoO4, which are consistent with the reported data of NiMoO4 [40,41]. In addition, the other bands at 343 and 364\u00a0cm\u22121 are attributed to characteristic vibration modes of MoO2 [42\u201344]. Notably, there are no characteristic bands of MoS2, revealing the absence of MoS2 phase in the S-NiMo/NF. Based on these structural analysis, the successful synthesis of S-NiMo/NF containing mixed pahses of NiMoO4 and MoO2 was realized. The surface morphology and microstructures of the as-fabricated electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2 a shows a general observation of the S-Ni/NF sample. The rod-shaped Ni3S2 was densely grown on the skeleton of NF. The magnified SEM image (Fig. 2b) reveals that the vertically aligned rods with smooth surfaces appear as a triangle tip with a length of approximately 2\u20132.5\u00a0\u03bcm. The energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) images (Fig. 2c) suggest that the Ni, S and O elements were evenly distributed in the rod-shaped Ni3S2. Consistent with the phase change induced by introducing Mo, the morphology evolution was also experienced in S-NiMo/NF sample. As displayed in Fig. 2d, the S-NiMo/NF sample was composed of a large number of nanospheres-assembled structures. These assembles showed the rough surfaces interconnected with each other, forming the unique architectured structures (Fig. 2e). Intesestingly, the close observation (Fig. 2f) reveals that the outer surfaces of the assembled architectures were stacked by crosslinked small nanosheets. Furthermore, the corresponding SEM-EDS mapping images (Fig. 2g) manifest the uniform distribution of Ni, Mo, S and O elements in the assembled architectures of S-NiMo/NF sample. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further performed to analyze the detailed microstruture and phase composition in S-NiMo/NF sample. Fig. 3 a shows a typical TEM image of S-NiMo scratched from NF, which demonstrates the nanosheets-stacked quasi-spherical architectures with diameters of 180\u2013330\u00a0nm, which is in good agreement with SEM observations. The magnified TEM image (Fig. 3b) illustrates that the random stacking of nanosheets results in a loose internal structures, facilitating the exposure of catalytic active site and electrolyte transport. Fig. 3c displays a typical high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of S-NiMo, which indicates two distinct nanodomains with different crystallinities (low-crystalline area 1 and crystalline area 2), leading to a distinguished interface between them in S-NiMo. The lattice spacings of 0.34\u00a0nm (Fig. 3d) and 0.25\u00a0nm (Fig. 3e) observed in the marked areas (Fig. 3c) are atrributed to (0\u00a00\u00a02) plane of hydrous NiMoO4 and (1\u00a00\u00a00) plane of hexagonal MoO2, respectively. The EDS spectrum (Fig. 3f) and line scan (Fig. 3h) prove the Ni, Mo, S and O elements coexisted in the S-NiMo. The weak intensity of Ni signal indicates its relatively low Ni content in the S-NiMo sample. Moreover, the HAADF-STEM and corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 3g) elucidate that these elements are homogeneously dispersed across the entire S-NiMo architectures. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to clarify the elemental composition and chemical valence of S-NiMo. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S2, Supporting Information) suggests the presence of Ni, Mo, S. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "and O in S-NiMo, agreeing well with the EDS results. The high resolution Mo 3d XPS spectrum of S-NiMo (Fig. 4 a) can be fitted by two sets of Mo species. The peaks at binding energies (BEs) of 230.4 and 232.6\u00a0eV correspond to the Mo4+ species in MoO2 [45], while peaks at BEs of 231.7 and 235.3\u00a0eV are attributed to Mo6+ species in NiMoO4 [46], confirming the coexistence of tetravalent and hexavalent molybdenum in S-NiMo. The high resolution Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4b) can be divided into two components including major Ni2+ species with BEs of 855.9 and 873.7\u00a0eV and minor Ni3+ species with BEs of 858.2 and 876.1\u00a0eV, along with two shake-up satellite peaks at BEs of 862.0 and 880.3\u00a0eV. The detected Ni3+ species in S-NiMo would be ascribe to the introduction of S dopant, consistent with other previously reported anion doped NiMoO4 [37,47]. In high resolution S 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 4c), except for the S-O species (169.0\u00a0eV), the peaks at BEs of 161.9 and 163.8\u00a0eV are attributed to metal-S bonds, which proves the succesful introduction of S into NiMoO4 [36]. Furthermore, the high resolution O 1\u00a0s XPS spectrum (Fig. 4d) verifies the presence of the lattic oxygen (530.5\u00a0eV), deficient oxygen (531.4\u00a0eV) and oxygen in adsorbed water (532.5\u00a0eV), suggesting that S doping would induce the oxygen vacancies [36,37,48], which is favorable for the improved optical absorption and electroctalytic peformances. The ultraviolet\u2013visible-near-infrared (UV\u2013VIS-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was first measured to analyze solar absorption performance of S-NiMo/NF. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the black S-NiMo/NF exhibits the intense and brordband absorption in the wavelength range of 200\u20132500\u00a0nm weighted by the global standard sunlight spectrum of AM 1.5, revealing that S-NiMo/NF indeed holds outstanding solar harvesting capability, which is closely associated with local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of MoO2 in S-NiMo/NF [49,50]. Previous studies have demonstrated that MoO2 exhibits a metallic rather than semiconducting properties due to the absence of a distinct gap between the valence and conduction bands [49,51,52]. Moreover, the abundance of free d-electrons and high free electron gas density in MoO2 resemble typical plasmonic metal nanostructures [53]. The free electrons in plasmonic nanostructures can resonate on the lattice and be excited to a higher energy level at the Fermi level, forming a hot electron cloud. Subsequent relaxation process via electron\u2013electron scattering leads to a significant increase in local surface temperature of LSPR nanomaterials [54\u201356]. To verify the LSPR induced local thermal effect, the surface temperatures of the S-NiMo/NF were measured under the irradiation of simulated solar light with different intensities. The IR camera was employed to capture the thermal images of the S-NiMo/NF under 1, 3 and 5 sun irradiations. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the average surface temperatures of the S-NiMo/NF immediately rises to 58, 101 and 115\u00a0\u00b0C within 20\u00a0s irradiated by 1, 3 and 5 sun, respectively, confirming the excellent photothermal performance of S-NiMo/NF for effective and rapid solar-to-heat conversion. In addition, we also monitor the surface temperature accurately and in real time by k-type thermocouple. Fig. 5c shows the time-dependent surface temperatures of S-NiMo/NF under different light intensities. Furthermore, the photostability and reproducibility of the photothermal response of S-NiMo/NF were tested by several cycles of alternating on\u2013off light, as shown in Fig. 5d. Obviously, the S-NiMo/NF maintains an almost constant surface temperature in each cycle under light illumination, but it quickly drops to room temperature when the light is turned off, demonstrating the excellent reusability of the S-NiMo/NF for photothermal conversion application. On the basis of the excellent ability toward photothermal conversion, the S-NiMo/NF was integrated with the commercial thermoelectric (TE) module to fabricate the solar-thermal-electric conversion device, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 6 a. A piece of S-NiMo/NF (3\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0cm) was loaded on the hot side of TE module, and the water circulation system was used to control the cold side temperature of TE module at 25\u00a0\u00b0C to obtain the desirable temperature difference for electricity generation. For comparison, the blank TE module and NF integrated TE module (Fig. 6b) were also tested under same conditions. Fig. 6c shows the time-dependent open circuit voltage (Voc) of the TE module integrated with different samples under 5 sun irradiation. All the tested TE modules can quickly reach maximum Voc within 5\u00a0min. The stable values of Voc can reach 144, 283, and 353\u00a0mV under 5 sun irradiation for blank, NF and S-NiMo/NF, respectively, confirming the superiority of photothermal S-NiMo/NF for thermoelectric power generation. Correspondingly, the S-NiMo/NF also achieves the short-circuit current (Isc) of 49.1\u00a0mA (Fig. 6d), which is larger than that of blank (16.6\u00a0mA) and NF (25.9\u00a0mA). In addition, the solar-thermal-electric stability under chppoed light illumination can be well maintained in three on\u2013off cycles (Fig. S3 and Fig. S4, Supporting Information). To further regular the robust solar-thermal-electric performance, the S-NiMo/NF integrated TE module was illuminated under different solar internsities to obtain the smart surface temperature of hot side on TE module. The Voc of S-NiMo/NF integrated TE generator gradually increases with increasing the light intensities from 1 sun to 5 sun (Fig. 6e). When the light is turned on, the output voltage of S-NiMo/NF integrated TE generator is quickly gneerated, but Voc drops rapidly to nearly zero once the light is turned off, which is observed under irradiation of different light intensities (Fig. 6f). Furthermore, the Isc also displays a similar trend to Voc, as shown in Fig. 6g and Fig. 6h, confirming the excellent reproducible performance. Fig. 6i compares the output power of S-NiMo/NF integrated TE generator under irradiation of different light intensities. Clearly, it also shows the light intensity dependent output powe, yielding a maximum output power of 0.23, 1.67 and 6.02\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122 under 1, 3 and 5 sun irradiation, respectively. It is notable that the S-NiMo/NF integrated TE generator with excellent solar-thermal-electric conversion would be used as a self-driven power for clean hydrogen energy production, because the S-NiMo/NF itself bears the electrocatalytically active NiMoO4 and MoO2 for water splitting. To accomplish the photothermal S-NiMo/NF for thermoelectric powered energy-efficient hydrogen production, we first studied the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "electrocatalytic OER performances of the S-NiMo/NF under alkaline conditions. Fig. 7 a shows the polarization curves towards OER of the S-NiMo/NF at a scan rate of 5\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121, along with NF, S-Ni/NF and NiMo/NF as comparison. The S-NiMo/NF exhibits the better OER activity than that of NF, S-Ni/NF and NiMo/NF, as proved by its significantly larger catalytic current density at the same overpotential. For instance, at an applied potential of 1.6\u00a0V vs RHE, the catalytic current densities are 8.3, 11.7, 41.2, and 50.8\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 provided by NF, S-Ni/NF, NiMo/NF and S-NiMo/NF, respectively. Correspondingly, the S-NiMo/NF also presents an eariler onset potential, a smaller Tafel slope (Fig. 7b) and a charge transfer resistance (Fig. 7c), highlighting its favorable OER electrocatalysis process with fast reaction kinetics. The chronopotentiometric curve (Fig. S5, Supporting Information) shows that S-NiMo/NF can retain a nearly constant OER potential for 100\u00a0h at an applied current density of 50\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, revealing its outstanding OER durability. Considering that the relatively high overpotential of OER leads to the undesirable large energy consumption for pratical application, the urea molecule with a low thermodynamic oxidation potential of 0.37\u00a0V was introduced to substitute OER to realize the energy-efficient water splitting [57,58]. Furthermore, the UOR performance of the S-NiMo/NF was evaluated in 1.0\u00a0M KOH with 0.33\u00a0M urea. As shown in Fig. 7d, the significant enhancement of anodic current density is observed when introducing the urea into KOH electrolyte. To afford a current density of 50\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, the potential required by UOR is only 1.425\u00a0V vs RHE, which is 173\u00a0mV less than the potential obtained by OER (1.598\u00a0V vs RHE), demonstrating the energy-efficient process of UOR. Fig. 7e shows the polarization curves towards UOR of the S-NiMo/NF, along with the S-Ni/NF, NiMo/NF, and bare NF as comparison. It can be found that the S-NiMo/NF provides the larger current density of 146\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 than that of S-Ni/NF (121\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122), NiMo/NF (98\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122) and NF (95\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122) at the applied potential of 1.6\u00a0V vs RHE. Specifically, the S-NiMo/NF displays the favorable UOR activity compared with the previously reported UOR electrocatalysts, with a smaller potential of 1.35\u00a0V vs RHE to attain a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122. The corresponding Tafel plots (Fig. 7f) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. 7g) further confirm the smaller Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance than those of OER process, implying the rapid electrocatalytic UOR rate of S-NiMo/NF. As shown in Fig. 7h, there is no obvious change in UOR potential at a constant current density of 50\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 within 24\u00a0h of test. Meanwhile, the negligible alteration is observed for LSV curve after 2000 of cyclic voltammetry test (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). Fig. S7 shows the SEM and TEM images after UOR testing, which reveals no change in morphology of S-NiMo/NF after reaction. These results suggest the excellent durability of S-NiMo/NF. In addition, we also compare the HER process over S-NiMo/NF in 1.0\u00a0M KOH with or without urea. No impact of urea on the HER activity is observed from polarization curves (Fig. 7i), directly reflecting the retainable HER activity in urea electrolysis. Inspired by the excellent electrocatalytic UOR and HER performances of the S-NiMo/NF, a two-electrode urea electrolysis system was constructed by using the S-NiMo/NF as both cathode and anode for energy-efficient and sustainable production of hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 8 a, the S-NiMo/NF couple exhibit the remarkable activity with a low cell voltage of 1.574\u00a0V at a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 in a solution of 1.0\u00a0M KOH containing 0.33\u00a0M urea, while they require a large cell voltage of 1.625\u00a0V for overall water electrolysis to yield the same current density, suggesting the potential of UOR to replace OER for hydrogen generation. To proceed the practical application of multifunctional S-NiMo/NF, we tentatively employ the as-fabricated S-NiMo/NF-integrated thermoelectric generator as an external power source to self-drive the urea electrolysis over S-NiMo/NF. To obtain the desirable temperature difference for electricity generation, the S-NiMo/NF on hot side was irradiated by 5 sun, and the temperature of cold side was controlled at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. The power source was fabricated by a four-series-connection thermoelectric device (Fig. 8b) to provide the enough output, which is integrated with a urea electrolysis cell to demonstrate the self-powered hydrogen production (Fig. 8c). As shown in Fig. S8, the Voc of thermoelectric generator quickly reaches equilibrium within 3\u00a0min and remains stable at about 1.72\u00a0V. The effective generation of H2 bubbles at cathode and CO2 and N2 bubbles at anode is observed on the two S-NiMo/NF electrodes (Movie S1, Supporting Information), indicating the successful operation and high efficiency of our self-powered system. Since the bubbles generated at the anode are very easy to adhere to the tube wall, which affects gas collection and readings, we therefore only collected the hydrogen and record volume reading on the cathode. Fig. 8d shows the photographic record of H2 gas volume as a function of the electrolysis time, revealing a linear relationship with a slope of 2.68\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0min\u22121 for hydrogen production (Fig. 8e). The volume of hydrogen is about 3.6\u00a0mL after 6\u00a0h of urea electrolysis powered by thermoelectric generator, and the corresponding FE is calculated to be 97.6%  In summary, we have fabriacted the multifunctional heterostructure of MoO2 coupled sulfur-incorporated NiMoO4 via a simple one-pot hydrothermal approach and successfully developed a self-powered STEG-urea electrolysis system based on as-fabricated S-NiMo/NF for energy-efficient hydrogen production. The generated electricity is primarily transformed from S-NiMo/NF-integrated TE module under simulated solar irradiation by controlling temperature difference. The S-NiMo/NF exhibits excellent performances for electrocatalytic HER and UOR in alkaline medium and affords a low cell voltage of 1.574\u00a0V at a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 for urea electrolysis. When irradiated by solar light at intensity of 5 sun, the hydrogen production rate reaches 2.68\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0min\u22121 in S-NiMo/NF-based solar thermoelectric urea electrolysis system. This fantastic integrated system provides an alternative strategy to convert solar energy into green hydrogen energy. Jing Jiang: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

Thus their catalytic and sensing properties depend on their shape and exposed crystal faces, which are finely determined by atomic structures on the surface [1\u20134]. Recently, semiconductor micro-/nanocrystals with controlled shape and exposed well-defined facets have attracted intensive research interests [3,4]. As an important II-VI n-type metal oxide semiconductor with a band gap width of 2.2~2.9\u00a0eV [5], cadmium oxide (CdO) nanostructures and thin film with controlled shapes have been investigated extensively owing to its high conductivity [6,7], high light transmission [6,8] and excellent thermal stability [9] as well as promising applications for solar cells [5\u20137], photodiode [7,10], electrochemical capacitors [11,12], lithium-ion battery [13] and photocatalysis [12,14,15]. In addition, in recent years, gas sensing property of hexagonal nanosheets [16,17], nanowires [18,19], nanorods [20], porous nanoribbons [21], nanosheet arrays [22] and nanocrystalline film [9,23,24] of CdO to NH3 [9], CO [16], liquefied petroleum gas [17,23,24], ethanol [18,21], NOx [19,20] and ether [22] have been investigated, and shape-dependent sensing property has been observed [16\u201318,21]. Moreover, the sensing performances of CdO are enhanced through doping with Fe [25], Co [26], Cu [27], and Ru [28] elements and preparing CdO-TiO2 [29,30], CdO-MnO2 [31], CdO-ZnO [32], CdO-Fe2O3 [33] and graphene/CdO [34] nanocomposites. However, there is no report on the enhanced sensing performances of CdO nanocrystals with well-defined facets in literature up to now. Gas sensing by n-type semiconductor metallic oxides like CdO is based on the redox reaction of the adsorbed oxygen with the reducing detected gas taking place on the surface of n-type metallic oxide semiconductors, which result in a sudden variation in electrical conductance of the CdO gas sensor [9,22,35,36]. Theoretically, the gas sensing property of metallic oxide semiconductors depend closely on the exposed crystal faces and surface structure of the sensing materials. However, the effect of surface structure on sensing property of CdO has never been studied, and the detailed response mechanism at atomic and molecule level is unknown so far. Herein, we prepared CdO octahedrons exposed with {111} crystal planes. Response of the CdO sensors to ethanol, acetone and triethylamine can obviously be increased by removing O-H groups and increasing density of Cd3c atoms on Cd-CdO (111) surface of CdO octahedrons though hydrogenation. We thus consider the unsaturated Cd3c atom act as a reactive center for gas sensing and present a detailed mechanism.  The CdO octahedrons were synthesized according to a method described in the literature [37]. In a typical experiment, 0.40\u00a0g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 1.23\u00a0g of cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and 14\u00a0mL of ethanol were mixed and heated at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0h to obtain CdO octahedrons. In order to obtain hydrogenated CdO octahedrons, the as-synthesized CdO octahedrons were heated at 100, 150 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 12 to 48\u00a0h in the H2 gas flow (2\u00a0L/h). Crystal structure, micromorphology and chemical composition of the CdO samples were characterized and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD analysis was achieved by a Haoyuan DX-2700 automatic X-ray diffractometer with radiation of CuK\u03b11 (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01.54056\u00a0\u00c5). The SEM and TEM analyses were implemented using a Hitachi SU8020 microscope and a JEOL JEM-2800 microscope. The infrared (IR) spectra were obtained by using a Bruker Equinx 55 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. The XPS spectra were obtained by using a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer with radiation source of Al Ka. The CdO sensors were fabricated using 10\u00a0mg of the non-hydrogenated/hydrogenated CdO octahedrons and 0.1\u00a0mL of terpilenol according to the process described in the literature [38,39]. The as-fabricated CdO gas sensors were aged at 350\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h to improve their stability. Ra/Rg is defined as the response of the sensor to the test gas. Rg and Ra represent resistance values of the CdO sensor in the test gas and in the air at working temperature of 350\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.  Fig.\u00a01 a illustrates XRD pattern from the as-synthesized CdO products. The peaks at 33.04, 38.34, 55.33, 65.98 and 69.33\u00b0 correspond to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) diffraction peaks of cubic CdO phase, respectively, indicating that the product is pure CdO with a cubic structure. Additionally, the ratio of (111) to other diffraction line intensity is obviously higher than that from standard XRD pattern of the cubic phase CdO powders, suggesting preferred (111) orientation. The texture coefficient of (111) face (TC (111)) is defined as [8]: TC(111)=I(111)I0(111)1n\u2211I(hkl)I0(hkl)-1 where I (hkl) is intensity of (hkl) reflection from the measured XRD pattern, I0 (hkl) is diffraction intensity from the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card file No. 65-2908, and n represents the number of diffraction lines employed in the estimate. For powder samples with random crystal orientations, the TC(111) should be 1. The TC(111) of CdO product is estimated to be 1.21, indicating preferred (111) orientation. The corresponding SEM image is shown in Fig.\u00a01b, which reveals that the CdO products consist of octahedrons with the side lengths of 0.56 to 1.80\u00a0\u03bcm. Fig.\u00a01c shows TEM image of a single [111] orientated CdO octahedron with a side length of about 1.38\u00a0\u03bcm. Fig.\u00a01d displays high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image from the box in (c). The spacing of adjacent fringes of 0.16\u00a0nm corresponds 22\u00af0 faces of cubic phase CdO. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image is shown in Fig.\u00a01e, which is assigned to [111] zone axis of cubic phase CdO. The HRTEM and SAED indicate that the as-prepared CdO octahedron is surrounded by {111} crystal faces. The crystallographic orientation is given in Fig.\u00a01f. Fig.\u00a02 a displays IR spectrum from the CdO octahedrons. the O-H stretching vibration peak located around 3458\u00a0cm\u22121 was observed, indicating there is a large amount of OH groups at the surface of CdO octahedrons. As is known to all, CdO adopts face-centered cubic NaCl structure [40\u201343] and its structure model is given in Fig.\u00a02b. Apparently, each O/Cd atom is linked octahedrally to six Cd/O atoms in a cube [44]. The CdO {111} surface structure obtained from periodic density functional. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "theory calculations is displayed in Fig.\u00a02c. It can be seen that the exposed {111} polar faces are composed of two different surface terminations, a Cd-terminated Cd-CdO surface (Cd-CdO (111)) and an O-terminated O-CdO (O-CdO (\u22121\u22121\u22121)) surface. The Cd atoms on the Cd-CdO (111) surface are fully 3-coordinated. However, IR spectrum in Fig.\u00a02a indicates that vast quantities of OH groups exist at the Cd-CdO (111) surface, and the possibly actual structure of Cd-CdO (111) surface is shown in Fig.\u00a02d. Responses of the as-prepared CdO octahedron sensors at 200~400\u00a0\u00b0C to 50\u00a0ppm of ethanol were determined and the results are shown in Fig. S1. As the operating temperature increased from 200 to 350\u00a0\u00b0C, variation on the resistance of the sensor increased gradually. However, when the operating temperature increased uninterruptedly to 400\u00a0\u00b0C, the resistance\u2019s variation reduced. Thus, 350\u00a0\u00b0C is identified as the optimum operating temperature of the CdO gas sensors. To study the effect of OH groups at CdO (111) surface on sensing property of CdO octahedrons, the as-synthesized CdO octahedrons were hydrogenated at 100, 150 and 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h, respectively, to remove the OH groups on the (111) surface. Responses of the sensors based on the as-obtained hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated CdO octahedrons to 50\u00a0ppm of acetone, ethanol and triethylamine were measured. The results are given in Fig. S2. For the three kinds of test gases, response of the hydrogenated CdO octahedrons is significantly higher that of the non-hydrogenated CdO octahedrons. As the hydrogenation temperature rises from 100 to 150\u00a0\u00b0C, the response value increases. However, when the hydrogenation temperature further rises to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, the response lowers. So, the appropriate hydrogenation temperature is 150\u00a0\u00b0C. The as-synthesized CdO octahedrons were hydrogenated at 150\u00a0\u00b0C for 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48\u00a0h, respectively. The as-obtained six kinds of non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated CdO samples are labeled as CdO, CdO-H-12, CdO-H-18, CdO-H-24, CdO-H-36 and CdO-H-48, respectively. Fig. 3 shows SEM images of the six kinds of non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated CdO octahedrons. SEM observations indicate that after hydrogenating for 12, 18 and 24\u00a0h, the octahedral structure was maintained basically. However, as the hydrogenating time is >24, the CdO octahedron structure was damaged, and some nanoparticles were formed on the sample surfaces. XRD patterns of the six kinds of CdO samples are given in Fig. 4 , which reveal that after hydrogenating 48\u00a0h, the samples are yet pure cubic phase CdO, and no Cd metal is formed. However, as the hydrogenated time is extended to 36 and 48\u00a0h, the intensity ratios of (111) to other diffraction lines are clearly reduced. The TC(111) values of CdO-H-12, CdO-H-18, CdO-H-24, CdO-H-36 and CdO-H-48 are estimated to be 1.15, 1.07, 1.07, 0.96 and 0.90, respectively, indicating that the preferred orientation of (111) crystal plane decreases with hydrogenation time, which is supported by the SEM observation in Fig. 3. Thus we consider that the percentage of exposed (111) surface decreases in the order of CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. The transient response curves of the six types of hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated CdO samples towards acetone, ethanol and triethylamine with different concentrations are shown in Fig. S3. It was seen that electrical resistance of the sensors rapidly reduces as the target gas was injected into the test box. After the target gas was released, the resistance increases quickly and recovers to the initial value. The change in resistance is a typical gas-sensing behavior of n-type semiconductor sensors. Fig.\u00a05 a, b and c show responses of the six types of CdO sensors towards acetone, ethanol and triethylamine, respectively. It is obvious that for the three kinds of target gases, the hydrogenated CdO samples have larger responses than the CdO sample without hydrogenation. The responses increase when the hydrogenation time increases from 12 to 24\u00a0h. However, it decreases when hydrogenation time further extends. The response follows the order of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. For 5\u00a0ppm of acetone, ethanol and triethylamine, the response value of the CdO-H-24 sensor is as high as 1.32, 1.55, and 1.66 respectively. Comparison of sensing properties of CdO microstructure based sensors reported in literatures [18,21,25,26,45\u201347] and hydrogenated CdO-H-24 octahedron sensor is shown in Table 1 . Clearly, response values of the CdO-H-24 octahedron sensor to ethanol [18,21,25,26,46] and acetone [26,47] are larger than that of CdO nanoparticle [45], nanowires [18,21], a mixture of nanowalls and nanowires [21], thin film [26], CdO-ZnO composite nanowire [46], Fe [25] and Co [26] doped CdO thin films, and lower than 3D hierarchical CdO nanostructure with surface area of about 85.3\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121 [47]. Fig.\u00a06 a shows IR spectra of the six kinds of CdO octahedrons. It can be seen that the peak intensity of O-H groups is decreased by hydrogenation. When the hydrogenation time was \u226524\u00a0h, the peak of O-H groups disappeared completely, indicating that the O-H groups are removed fully. When the as-synthesized CdO octahedrons were hydrogenated, the O-H groups at Cd-CdO (111) surface reacted with H2 to form H2O. As a result, more unsaturated Cd3c atoms are formed at the (111) surface. The surface hydrogenation reaction is given in Fig.\u00a06b. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, when the hydrogenation time increases to 36 and 48\u00a0h, the CdO octahedrons have been damaged, and TC(111) value <1, revealing that percentage of (111) surface reduces. Thus, we concluded that the numbers of surface unsaturated Cd3c atoms follow the order of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. This order is same as the response order of sensors to test gases. We thus concluded that the exposed Cd-CdO (111) plane is an active surface for gas sensing reaction. The enhanced response of the hydrogenated CdO octahedrons to target gases may arise from the increase in the number of Cd3c atoms with three dangling bonds after hydrogenation. The unsaturated Cd3c atom may serve as a reactive center for gas sensing. In order to investigate the function of unsaturated Cd3c atoms at the Cd-CdO (111) surface in the sensing reaction, XPS spectra from the six kinds of hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated CdO octahedrons were measured. The Cd 3d and O 1s XPS spectra are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 , respectively. In Fig. 7, the spin-orbit components. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 at 404.3 and 411.2\u00a0eV [48,49] are observed respectively. Each Cd 3d5/2 or Cd 3d3/2 spectrum can be fitted into two components. According to the reference [50] the positions at 410.6 and 404.2\u00a0eV corresponds to Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 of Cd (II), respectively. The peaks at 412.0 and 405.7\u00a0eV corresponds to Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 of Cd (I), respectively. The relative percentages of Cd (II) and Cd (I) components are shown in Table 2 . Apparently, the relative percentage of Cd (I) component follows the order of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. As shown in Fig. 8, each spectrum of O 1s can also be fitted to two components. The peaks located 530.8 and 533.6\u00a0eV [48] are indexed to lattice oxygen (OL) as well as adsorbed oxygen (OA) and OH group [51], respectively. The total relative percentage of OA and OH and the relative percentage of OL are given in Table 1. The total relative percentage of OA and OH obeyed the sequence of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. On the basis of IR spectra in Fig.\u00a06a we considered that the relative percentage of OA obeys the order of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. The order is identical to that of the relative percentage of surface Cd (I) and that of the responses of sensors. In addition, changes in the resistances of the six types of CdO octahedron gas sensors in clean air and air containing ethanol with different concentrations were investigated. The results are given in Fig.\u00a09 a, b and Table 3 . Obviously, in the air, the six types of CdO gas sensors have larger resistances, and their resistance values abide by the order of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. When 200\u00a0ppm of ethanol was injected into the test box, the resistances of the six types of CdO octahedron sensors decreased rapidly and became smaller and smaller with increasing concentration of ethanol. For CdO, CdO-H-12, CdO-H-18, CdO-H-24, CdO-H-36 and CdO-H-48 sensors, when the concentration of ethanol increases to 2200, 2600, 3000, 3000, 3200 and 3200\u00a0ppm, respectively, the resistance reached a constant value. Therefore, for these sensors, their saturated concentration is 2200, 2600, 3000, 3000, 3200 and 3200\u00a0ppm, respectively. Obviously, in the saturated concentration of ethanol, the six types of CdO octahedron sensors had the smallest resistance. The resistance changed in the order of CdO\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-48. It is well known that CdO is a non-stoichiometric metal oxide with oxygen vacancies which can generate free electrons [44,52]. Therefore, in CdO, majority carrier is electron, which participated in electric conduction process. As shown in Fig.\u00a02b and c, each oxygen vacancy in CdO lattice can generate six Cd5c atoms. Thus, we consider that the free electrons in CdO are virtually created by the unsaturated Cd atoms. In the air, the Cd3c atoms i.e. Cd(I) can adsorb oxygen molecules due to oxygen deficiency on the Cd-CdO (111) surface. The adsorbed oxygen captured free electrons in CdO to form O\u2212 or O2 \u2212 ions [18,22,23], An electron depletion layer was thus produced near the Cd-CdO (111) surface [2]. The number of the conductive electrons is the smallest in the electron depletion layer, and thus the CdO octahedron sensors show the largest resistance values in the air, as shown in Fig.\u00a010 a. It can be seen from IR spectra in Fig. 6 that the numbers of surface unsaturated Cd3c atoms follow the order of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. Thus, the amounts of adsorbed oxygen and the electrical resistance of sensors follow the same order. When the CdO gas sensor was exposed to the target gas, the O\u2212 or O2 \u2212 species on the Cd-CdO (111) surface was reduced [9,18,33] by the target gas. The gas sensing reactions can be formulated as follows: CH3COCH3(g)+8O\u2212=3CO2(g)+3H2O(g)+8e CH3COCH3(g)+4O2 \u2212=3CO2(g)+3H2O(g)+4e C2H5OH(g)+6O\u2212=2CO2(g)+3H2O(g)+6e C2H5OH(g+3O2 \u2212=2CO2(g)+3H2O(g)+3e 4N(C2H5)3(g)+78O\u2212=24CO2(g)+2N2(g)+30H2O(g)+78e 4N(C2H5)3(g)+39O2 \u2212=24CO2(g)+2N2(g)+30H2O(g)+39e After reaction, the O\u2212 or O2 \u2212 species transformed into CO2 and H2O gases and depart from the Cd-CdO (111) surface, and the electrons trapped by O\u2212 or O2 \u2212 species were released and changed into free conductive electrons. The number of the free conductive electrons increases in the electron depletion layer, and thus, the resistance of the CdO octahedron sensor decreases (Fig.\u00a010b, c). When the target gas reaches the saturated concentration, the adsorbed oxygen is completely removed, and the electrons controlled by the adsorbed oxygen were completely changed into the conductive free electrons. The number of the conductive electrons is the largest in the electron depletion layer. Therefore, the CdO octahedron sensor exhibits the highest conductivity, as shown in Fig.\u00a010d, e. The unsaturated Cd3c atoms can produce free electrons. Thus, the numbers of conductive free electrons in the depletion layer and the conductivity of CdO sensor follow the order of CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48 in the saturated concentration of ethanol. Additionally, as shown in Fig.\u00a09c, for 200\u00a0ppm of ethanol, the reduced resistance values of CdO, CdO-H-12, CdO-H-48, CdO-H-18 CdO-H-36 and CdO-H-24 sensors are 52, 70, 90, 102, 93 and 83\u00a0\u03a9, respectively, which indicates that the amounts of the adsorbed oxygen removed by ethanol abide by CdO\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-12\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-18\u00a0<\u00a0CdO-H-24\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-36\u00a0>\u00a0CdO-H-48. Therefore, we believed that Cd3c atoms not only can generate free electrons, absorb oxygen from air but also catalyze gas sensing reactions.  In summary, the CdO octahedrons with exposed {111} facets have been successfully prepared by a solvothermal process. Gas sensitivity of the CdO octahedrons is obviously improved by removing OH groups and increasing density of Cd3c atoms on Cd-CdO (111) surface of CdO octahedrons though hydrogenation. We thus concluded that single Cd3c atom on the CdO (111) surface serves a sensing reaction active site and described in detail the sensing reaction mechanism. The sensing and catalytic properties of other metallic oxides may be enhanced by using hydrogenation technology. The gas sensing mechanism is helpful to understand gas sensing and heterogeneous catalytic reactions of other metal oxides and provide the new insights for developing high performance gas sensing and catalytic materials.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

In particular, the necessity of electric vehicles (EVs) has been forced with the environmental issue such as global warming, so that the development of long-lasting batteries that can be mounted on EVs has become much more important. In practical lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for EVs, the LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05/graphite (NCA-graphite) system is employed, for example [1]. However, there are increasing needs for alternative materials to graphite to secure the battery life and safety. In addition, the introduction of a cheap cathode material such as LiMn2O4 (LMO) has always been an economic issue. The LMO/LTO (LTO\u00a0=\u00a0lithium titanate, Li4Ti5O12) system could thus be very promising in that manner [1] because LTO is far from the breakdown problem occurred in the LMO/graphite system, caused by the dissolved Mn and the acidic decomposition products of the electrolyte [2\u20137]. However, LTO has a theoretical capacity of 175 mAh g\u22121, less than the half of the graphite capacity of 372 mAh g\u22121, and thus mesoporous TiO2 materials are now being tested as an alternative to LTO. TiO2 is an exceptionally stable, nontoxic, inexpensive and abundant material, having a theoretical capacity of 335 mAh g\u22121 marginally smaller than that of graphite [8,9]. Its decent cyclability and high rate capability have been reported for LIBs as well [10]. The crystalline phase of TiO2 anodes is one of the important factors that determine the properties of LIBs. TiO2 is mainly divided into anatase, rutile and brookite according to its crystal structure [11]. Among them, anatase and rutile are mostly used to fabricate LIBs at the present. Many different studies have shown the difference between anatase and rutile such as anatase\u2019s wider bandgap, longer charge-carrier lifetime, longer exciton diffusion length, and higher charge-carrier mobility [12,13]. In addition, it has been found that anatase has better electric conductivity than rutile, so that it shows better performance for LIB anodes [14]. Meanwhile, we reported noteworthy performance of lotus-root shaped meso-/macroporous TiO2 (hereafter, LR-TiO2) of anatase phase for the photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) owing to the efficient charge transfer through its columnar structure [15]. We also reported that the synergistic effect of coexisting anatase and rutile phases in a mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) with an optimal ratio could lead to an efficient interfacial transfer of electrons between phases [16,17]. When porous TiO2 is synthesized, its crystallinity can be easily controlled by the calcination temperature, and the transition temperature at which anatase is converted to rutile was known to be about 600\u00a0\u00b0C [18\u201320]. Basically, the operation mechanism of DSSCs is very similar to LIBs. Thus, in this study, the LR-TiO2 was to be applied as an anode material for LIBs and the phase of the LR-TiO2 was controlled by the calcination at three different temperatures of 450, 550 and 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The LR-TiO2 was expected to provide an efficient bulk Li+ transfer through the columnar macro-channels and high surface area for Li+ insertion in its mesoporous structure, and the presence of mixed phases was to expect a synergistic electron transfer.  The mixture of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (1.0\u00a0g, 2.74\u00a0mmol, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), cholesterol (0.5\u00a0g, 1.29\u00a0mmol, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), and 2.0\u00a0M NaOH (3.5\u00a0mL, 7.0\u00a0mmol) in deionized water (400\u00a0mL) was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 1\u00a0h (700\u00a0rpm). Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (5.76 g, 20.3\u00a0mmol, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) was rapidly injected into the reaction mixture and stirred for 2\u00a0h. The resulting light-yellow solids were retrieved by filtration and washed with deionized water. The solids were dried in an oven at 80\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. The solids were heat treated at 700 (hereafter, LR-TiO2-700), 550 (hereafter, LR-TiO2-550), and 450\u00a0\u00b0C (hereafter, LR-TiO2-450), respectively, in air for 4\u00a0h (ramping rate\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0min\u22121). The color of the solids changed into white after heat treatment. For comparison, cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide in aqueous solution was used in our previous synthesis of LR-TiO2 [10]. A TiO2 electrode was prepared for coin cell testing by casting a slurry containing 80\u00a0wt% active materials (LR-TiO2-450, LR-TiO2-550 and LR-TiO2-700), 10\u00a0wt% carbon black (Super PTM conductivity, 99+%, Alfa Aesar, USA) and 10\u00a0wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF, MTI Korea) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, MTI Korea) on Cu-foil. The slurry was evenly applied on a copper foil to a thickness of 120\u00a0\u03bcm, and preheated at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h and vacuum dried at 120\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. It was designed to have a material loading of about 1.1\u00a0mg\u00a0cm\u22122. The test cell had a typical three-electrode structure using lithium foil as a counter and reference electrode with Celgard 2400 microporous membrane as separator, and 1\u00a0M LiPF6 dissolved electrolyte (MK-LiPF6-100\u00a0g, MTI Korea) in ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene methyl carbonate (EMC) (1: 1: 1, v/v/v). The cells were assembled in an argon filled glove box. CR2032 coin half-cell was assembled in a glove box. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; Oxford Instruments, UK) were used to characterize the macroscopic structure and constitutional characteristics of LR-TiO2-450, LR-TiO2-550 and LR-TiO2-700, respectively, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; X'Pert-MPD System, PHILIPS, Netherland) was used to analyze their crystal structures. The coin half-cells were galvanostatically discharged to 1.0\u00a0V and charged to 3.0\u00a0V at a rate of 0.5 C using a cycler (WBCS300L, WonAtech Co., Korea). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an impedance analyzer (ZIVE SP1, WonAtech Co., Korea). The high rate performance was checked out by changing current density (0.5 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a01.0 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a00.5 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a02.0 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a00.5 C) every 10 cycle. EIS measurements were carried out using a 30\u00a0mV of amplitude in the frequency range of 0.1\u2013100\u00a0kHz. The N2 gas sorption analysis was performed using a Belsorp-mini II at 77\u00a0K. The samples were dried at 150\u00a0\u00b0C under high vacuum for 2\u00a0h before measurement.  The morphological differences among the three LR-TiO2 samples calcined at different temperatures were assessed using SEM investigation, as shown in Fig. 1 . Interestingly, well-developed macropores (or macro-channels) with a diameter of 2\u20133\u00a0\u03bcm were observed, which are expected to convey Li+ ions efficiently to the innermost part of the LR-TiO2 particles.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "The reaction between TiO2 and Li+ (also called Li+ insertion) then follows on the surface of mesoporous TiO2; TiO2\u00a0+\u00a0x(Li+ + e\u2212)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0LixTiO2. Generally, the Li+ insertion is valid only on the shallow surface due to the dense characteristics of bulk nonporous TiO2; in other words, Li+ insertion is effective only on the exposed surfaces for bulk nonporous sample. Contrarily, the mesoscale pores may play a role of providing Li+ ions to the inside of the particle promptly to take advantage of the innermost TiO2 surfaces. Although a different surfactant and base solution were used for the synthesis of LR-TiO2 in this study, almost the same morphological feature (lotus-root shape) was obtained compared to our previous one [10]. The addition of cholesterol may also play a key role in controlling the unique morphology. Moreover, the characteristic morphological feature (macro-channels) did not change regardless of the calcination temperature, as shown in Fig. 1. However, the crystalline phase was changed among the samples based on PXRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction peaks corresponding to rutile appeared at (110), (101), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (310) (JCPDS Card # 88\u20131175), clearly for the LR-TiO2-700 sample (see Fig. 2(c)), while anatase-rich LR-TiO2-450 sample showed (004), (101), (105), (200), (211), (204) and (310) peaks (JCPDS Card # 21-1272). Considering that anatase turns to rutile irreversibly at about 600\u00a0\u00b0C, LR-TiO2-700 and LR-TiO2-450 will mostly have the anatase and rutile phases, respectively, and LR-TiO2-550 will be somewhere between the two. It had already been presented by our work that anatase is composed of spherical NPs with an average size of ~10\u00a0nm, while rutile consists of rod-shaped NPs having dimensions of ~15\u00a0nm in diameter and ~100\u00a0nm in length [17]. In DSSC applications, lager rutile particles are less effective as photoanodes because of their lower surface area for dye adsorption compared to anatase ones [16,17]. However, a synergistic effect of efficient electron transfer was observed with an optimal ratio of rutile/anatase to overbalance the decrease of surface area by the presence of rutile particles [16,17]. Meanwhile, there are minor phase peaks in the PXRD pattern of LR-TiO2-700 (denoted by asterisks in Fig. 2), which are in fact those of disodium hexatitanate (IV) (Na2Ti6O13) (JCPDS Card # 73-1398) [21]. To obtain the constitutional information of the LR-TiO2 samples in quantity, EDS was employed and the results are given in Fig. 3 . The results (the inset numbers in Fig. 3) shows the presence of sodium element of 4\u20136 at.% in the LR-TiO2 samples in common regardless of the calcination temperature. It is because the basic condition was used in the synthesis of LR-TiO2 and sodium ions was crystallized into disodium hexatitanate (IV) phase at a high temperature of 700\u00a0\u00b0C. The porosity of electrode materials is also an important parameter for determining the performances of LIBs. The textural properties of the three LR-TiO2 samples were analyzed by a standard volumetric N2 adsorption-desorption analysis at 77\u00a0K. The N2 sorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 4 . The respective Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas and pore volumes for LR-TiO2-450, LR-TiO2-550, and LR-TiO2-700 are 40.2\u00a0m2 g\u22121 (0\u00a0<\u00a0P/P 0\u00a0<\u00a00.2046), 0.147\u00a0cm3 g\u22121 (at P/P 0\u00a0=\u00a00.989); 22.1\u00a0m2 g\u22121 (0\u00a0<\u00a0P/P 0\u00a0<\u00a00.2048), 0.105\u00a0cm3 g\u22121 (at P/P 0\u00a0=\u00a00.985); and 5.3\u00a0m2 g\u22121 (0\u00a0<\u00a0P/P 0\u00a0<\u00a00.2049), 0.027\u00a0cm3 g\u22121 (at P/P 0\u00a0=\u00a00.983). Both the BET surface areas and pore volumes gradually decrease upon the increase of calcination temperature. Interestingly, LR-TiO2-450 and LR-TiO2-550 show hysteretic behaviors between adsorption and desorption isotherms. LR-TiO2-700 exhibited very low level of gas sorption. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore diameters are determined to be 2.01 (LR-TiO2-450), 2.13 (LR-TiO2-550), and 2.28\u00a0nm (LR-TiO2-700), respectively. Despite these similar range of maximum pore diameters among the three samples, both LR-TiO2-450 and LR-TiO2-550 showed additional large mesopore distributions ranging from 5 to 50\u00a0nm (Fig. 4b). These extra large mesoporosity may be more favorable for fast Li+ transport for LR-TiO2-450 and LR-TiO2-550 compared to LR-TiO2-700. The cyclability and high rate performances of LR-TiO2 samples were tested as shown in Fig. 5 . LR-TiO2-450 had the highest capacity of 120 mAh g\u22121 at the 1st cycle. The capacity decreased down to 80 and 36 mAh g\u22121 at the 1st cycle as the calcination temperature increased up to 550 and 700\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (see Table 1 ). It is well described in the literature [14] that anatase has better electric conductivity than rutile. Additionally, the decreased surface areas of LR-TiO2-550 and LR-TiO2-700 compared to LR-TiO2-450 can be partly responsible for their lower capacities. By the way, LR-TiO2-550, which is expected to have mixed phases of anatase and rutile, did not show any special feature in terms of both capacity and retention rate. In fact, it was reported that the superior inter-particle connectivity between anatase and rutile phases could allow efficient electron transfer [17]. It suggests that the electron transfer has a minor effect in improving the performance of LR-TiO2. Generally, electrical resistance in LIBs is composed of the resistances induced by electron transfer and Li+ transfer; Rtot\u00a0=\u00a0Re- + RLi+. Thus, RLi + would be much greater than Re- in our LR-TiO2. The capacity decrease with respect to the increase of calcination temperature, as shown in Table 1, is also explained as the following suggestion that spherical anatase grains obtained at a lower calcination temperature would have much more surface area for Li+ insertion compared to rod-like larger rutile grains formed at a higher calcination temperature [16,17]. The high rate performance of LR-TiO2 (see Fig. 4b and Table 2 ) also showed how competing the Li+ transfer onto the surface of TiO2. The capacity reduction with the increase of C-rate is clearly observed for LR-TiO2-700; \u0394\u00a0=\u00a0\u221229 when 0.5 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a01.0 C and \u0394\u00a0=\u00a0\u221238 when 0.5 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a02.0 C. A high C-rate means more supply of Li+ ions, in other words, the concentration of Li+ ions in electrolyte increases. Thus, unlike in the graphite having a layered structure favorable for Li+ insertion (less resistance of Li+ transfer), Li+ ions have a hard time getting through tortuous mesopores in LR-TiO2 especially at the entrance of pores under high Li+ concentration. To analyze the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "resistance characteristics more specifically, EIS was measured as shown in Fig. 6 , and the resistance of each component in coin cells is described by an equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 6. In fact, the semi-circle is deconvoluted into two semi-circles; the smaller one (denoted as 1) represents the resistance at the standard Li electrode and the larger (denoted as 2) does the resistance at the LR-TiO2 electrode. Thus, Rs is the Ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, Q is the bilayer pseudo-capacity at the interface between electrode (Li or TiO2) and electrolyte, R is the resistance of the electrode (Li or TiO2) surface (charge transfer between the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and the electrode), and W is the impedance element that describes the solid diffusion process inside the TiO2 particles. Firstly, Rs is negligible for all the samples. Secondly, the shape of W curve indicates that the pore shape is simply cylindrical for all the samples, although a bit steeper slope in LR-TiO2-550 suggests a pore with thinner thickness inside probably coming from the stacking of mixed phase. The clear difference is observed in the anodic LR-TiO2 surface during the Li+ insertion because the resistance at the standard Li electrode is relatively small. As previously mentioned, the anatase phase in LR-TiO2-450, having a better electrical conductivity than rutile [14], would reduce the resistance for Li+ insertion, and spherical anatase grains would provide more surface area (or accommodation sites) for Li+ insertion by efficient stacking. In fact, anatase has more atoms per unit cell than rutile as well [22]. The effect of the superior inter-particle connectivity between anatase and rutile phases for efficient electron transfer was still minor as shown in the results for LR-TiO2-550. Fig. 7 showed cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of LR-TiO2-450, LR-TiO2-550, and LR-TiO2-700 samples between 1 and 3\u00a0V. Generally, irreversibility is attributed to the formation of the non-conductive SEI layer that forms at the surface of TiO2 due to side reactions between TiO2 and electrolyte species. This formation is reflected as a weak broad peak centered at 2.1\u00a0V in the cathodic branch of the first cycle CV curve (Fig. 7). Potential plateaus near 1.78 and 2.10\u00a0V during the discharge/charge processes are attributed to the Li+ ion insertion/extraction. However, the oxidation/reduction peaks tend to decrease with the calcination temperature, and they are hardly observed for LR-TiO2-700. Thus, the crystalline phase of LR-TiO2 is supposed to affect the SEI formation and the presence of rutile would lead to the unstable SEI layer.  Coin cells were fabricated using lotus-root shaped meso-/macroporous TiO2 (LR-TiO2) as an anode featured with macro-channels favorable for Li+ ion supply onto the surface of TiO2. To investigate the phase-dependent performance of LR-TiO2, samples were calcined at three different temperatures of 450, 550, and 700\u00a0\u00b0C. PXRD measurements confirmed anatase- and rutile-rich phases in LR-TiO2 calcined at 450\u00a0\u00b0C and 700\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, while all the samples had the same morphological characteristics based on SEM measurements. The surface area and pore volume decreased upon the increase of calcination temperature. Then, LR-TiO2-450 calcined at 450\u00a0\u00b0C with the highest anatase ratio and BET surface area showed the best capacity of 120 mAh g\u22121 at the first cycle and its retention rate was 74% at the 100th cycle. The extra large mesopores in the range 5\u201350\u00a0nm for LR-TiO2-450 also contribute this high capacity. The high rate performance showed the resistance increase (and/or the capacity decrease) with the increase of C-rate (0.5 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a01.0 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a02.0 C), and it indicated that Li+ ions are hard to pass through tortuous mesopores especially under high Li+ concentration. EIS analysis consistently confirmed that the resistance at the anodic surface becomes higher as the rutile content increases, which is probably contributed to a worse electrical conductivity of the rutile to anatase and the loss of surface area by a poor staking of rod-like rutile granules.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

In the past several decades, a large amount of literatures have reported the electron transfer phenomena between metallic NPs and dielectrics for material modification especially in the areas of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis [13\u201316]. Traditionally, it is believed that the electron transfer from dielectrics to NPs and the trap states of Schottky barrier at the interface between NPs and dielectrics result in the low recombination rate of electron-hole pairs, which enhances catalysis efficiency of dielectrics [17,18]. Benefitting from these ultrafast dynamic processes, the semiconductor TiO2, as one of the most widely used photocatalysts [19,20], shows giant enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency combined with noble metallic NPs (e.g., Ag NPs). However, the debate about physical mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic efficiency has gained fresh prominence nowadays. In some works, it is claimed that the electron transfer from plasmonic NPs to conduction band of semiconductors, called \u201chot electron injection\u201d, may be the dominant reason for the enhancement [21\u201326]. It is proposed that, with the excitation energy efficiently accumulated by the plasmonic NPs, the highly energetic electrons (known as hot electrons) escaped from the NPs may migrate to the adjacent dielectric materials if their energies are larger than the Schottky barrier [27]. Afterwards, the enhanced oxidability of NPs and reducibility of electron holes lead to higher catalysis efficiency. Nevertheless, more ultrafast dynamic investigations on the electron transfer process (from metallic NPs to TiO2 [21,27], or from TiO2 to metallic NPs [17,18]) are required for the in-depth understanding of the initial mechanism. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the optical nonlinearity modification of insulating dielectrics by plasmonic NPs. For example, the nonlinear refractive index of the AgNP:Nd:YAG nanocomposite (composed of Ag NPs and Nd:YAG crystal) was confirmed to be 4 orders of magnitude larger than that of pure Nd:YAG [28]. So far, however, no attention has been paid to the role of electron transfer on the optical nonlinearity modification of semiconductors. Considering the impact of the different electron transfer mechanism, the optical nonlinearity modification may in turn provide crucial evidence for judging the type of electron transfer process. Moreover, the electron transfer modified optical nonlinearity of semiconductors exhibits significant potential in ultrafast optical tailoring for superior performance of various photonic application. As one of the most important integrated photonic devices, mode-locked waveguide laser owns ultra-short pulse duration and ultra-high repetition rate. One of the greatest challenges for the development of ultrafast pulsed lasers is to reduce lasing threshold. So far, many attempts have been carried out to realize laser generation at low pump power, such as exciton laser, nanocavity laser and so on [29\u201331]. Most of these efforts are focused on the laser cavity structure optimization and novel dielectric exploitation. Since the optical nonlinearity of semiconductors can be modulated by electron transfer mechanism, it is promising to introduce an energy band system as modulator for reduced laser thresholds, which differs from the traditional \u201claser crystal\u201d plus \u201cSA\u201d laser system. In this work, an improved electron transfer model is proposed to elucidate the reduced saturation intensity of the AgNP:TiO2 nanocomposite. The 1-\u03bcm mode-locked lasers are achieved with AgNP:TiO2 as SA and Nd:YAG as gain medium. Different from the saturable absorption of prior nanocomposite SAs depending on the nonlinearity of NPs [32], the saturable absorption of AgNP:TiO2 nanocomposite chip in this work is attributed to the nonlinearity of TiO2 itself tailored by the electron transfer process. Embedded Ag NPs are introduced as modulator into the traditional laser cavity to build three-energy-level systems for low-threshold lasers.  Ion implantation is a well-developed technique to synthesize NPs [33\u201335]. The TiO2 wafer with a size of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm3 was optically polished. The 200\u00a0keV Ag+ ions were implanted into the TiO2 sample from one face (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0mm2) by analytical-type ion-implanter LC22-100-01 at the fluence of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01017 ions/cm2. The incident angle of the ion beam was 7\u00b0 off the normal plane of the sample surface in order to minimize the channeling effect. When the concentration of Ag+ ions exceeds the solubility of the dielectric [36,37], embedded Ag NPs were fabricated beneath the implanted surface of the TiO2 crystal. The electrocatalytic activity test was performed in acidic (0.5\u00a0M H2SO4) and alkaline (1\u00a0M KOH) mediums at a sweep rate of 50\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121, respectively. CVs were recorded by using an LK2005 electrochemical workstation equipped with a three-electrode system. The scan rate for CVs was 50\u00a0mV\u00a0s\u22121. The working electrode, counter electrode, reference electrode was glassy carbon electrode (3\u00a0mm in diameter), Pt sheet, and saturated calomel electrode, separately. The TiO2 and AgNPs:TiO2 were attached to the glass carbon electrode, respectively. Finally, typical CVs for different catalysts were obtained. TEM investigations were performed by FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN operated at an accelerating voltage of 200\u00a0kV. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscope, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements, and fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm were arranged to evaluate the shape, distribution, and structures of the formed nanostructures. In addition, the optical absorption spectra of the Ag NPs in TiO2 were measured by a UV\u2013VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-4100) within a wavelength range from 400 to 1100\u00a0nm. The femtosecond laser with wavelength of 1040\u00a0nm and pulse duration of 340\u00a0fs was divided into two light beams by a splitter. One was pump light to be used to motivate the sample, and the other was probe light generated by the time delay line. The polarization of pump light was perpendicular to probe light through controlling the half-wave plate and polarizer. After that, the probe and pump light were focused on the same point in the sample. The probe light signal was divided into two light beams: one was collected by a camera; another beam was focused on. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the detector by a lens and the signal was analyzed by computer through lock in amplifier. The fiber laser with single mode in pump-probe measurement was un-tunable with the spot size of 130\u00a0\u03bcm. Both of the wavelength of pump and probe light were 1040\u00a0nm. The modulation frequency of the laser and chopper was 1\u00a0kHz and 300\u00a0Hz, respectively. As for the coherent artifact, more advanced and specialty technique like the frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) or other interferometric methods [38\u201340] was needed for more precise pulse-structure measurement, which was beyond the scope of our discussion. In this work, the polarization of the probe was rotated to be perpendicular to the pump to reduce the effect of coherent artifacts [41,42], by which the coherent artifacts due to the coherence of pump and probe could be neglected in our experiments. A typical OA Z-scan system was used to investigate the nonlinear optical response of Ag NPs embedded TiO2 crystals. It was carried out by using femtosecond pulsed laser at 1030\u00a0nm with a pulse energy of 30 nJ. The repetition rate and pulse duration were 100\u00a0Hz and 340\u00a0fs, respectively. The sample moved along the laser propagation direction gradually on a linearly motorized translation stage through the focus of a lens with a focal length of 150\u00a0mm. At the same time, the transmittance through the sample was measured as a function of the incident laser intensity. Based on the obvious saturable absorption of AgNP:TiO2, Q-switched mode-locked waveguide lasers were implemented by using a Nd:YAG waveguide as gain cavity [43]. The schematic diagram of mode-locked pulsed laser is shown in Fig. S1.  The schematic of Ag+ ion implantation into TiO2 is shown in Fig. 1 (a), and the insert shows the photographs of the TiO2 crystals (A) before and (B) after Ag+ ion implantation. The microstructure characterizations of AgNP:TiO2 by TEM are indicated in Fig. 1(b)\u2014(g). Fig. 1(b) shows the TEM images of sample, in which Ag NPs are synthesized in TiO2 crystal and mainly distributed at ~60\u00a0nm under the surface of substrate, which is in good agreement with the simulated result by the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) code (see Fig. 1(c)) [44]. Fig. 1(d) indicates the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image. The embedded Ag NPs are crystalline, and the inset displays interplanar spacing d of synthesized Ag NPs. The d is determined to be 0.24\u00a0nm, which is quite well consistent with the counterpart of Ag with the crystal orientation (1 1 1) from the standard data card (PDF#65-8428). The diameter distribution of Ag NPs is shown in Fig. 1(e). The average diameter of Ag NPs in TiO2 is ~1.5\u00a0nm. Fig. 1(f) and (g) depict the SAED images of the implanted area of TiO2 before and after ion implantation. As shown, the state of substrates around NPs has been transformed from crystalline state to locally amorphous state due to the damage caused by ion implantation. Traditionally, catalysis is considered as one of the most effective methods to confirm the existence of electron transfer. The electron transfer mechanism between Ag+ ions and TiO2 semiconductor in AgNP:TiO2 nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The hot electrons are generated in the Ag NP system via optical excitation. If Fermi energy plus the energy of excitation is greater than conduction band energy of the semiconductor, the electron transfer will occur. Hot electrons from Ag NPs transfer to the conduction band (C. B.) of TiO2, occupying positions of electrons from valence band (V. B.) of TiO2, which can be confirmed by catalysis in general. Previous studies of Tsuji et al. have reported the photocatalytic properties of metal negative-ion implanted TiO2 by means of decolorization of methylene blue solution under fluorescent light [45]. The Ag-implanted TiO2 shows 6.7 times larger efficiency owing to electron transfer process. In addition to photocatalysis, electrocatalysis can also be enhanced by the electron transfer. Electrocatalysis measurement is carried out in this work and results can be seen in Fig. 2(b)\u2014(d). Fig. 2(b) shows the typical cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves for the TiO2 and AgNP:TiO2 in 0.5\u00a0M H2SO4 solution. Fig. 2(c) shows the CV curves for the TiO2 and AgNP:TiO2 in 1\u00a0M KOH solution. Fig. 2(d) indicates the electrochemical stability using chronoamperometric (CA) measurements performed at 0.61\u00a0V for 200\u00a0s. The CA curves indicate that the current density of the AgNP:TiO2 in 1\u00a0M KOH solution is about 0.2\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, which is much higher than that of TiO2 of 0.004\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 for the entire time course. The obvious comparison further verifies that the AgNP:TiO2 provides enhanced electrocatalytic performance. However, for photocatalysis, it is limited to the long discolourization time (19\u00a0h) under fluorescent light through UV-cut filter and it is difficult to characterize the decolorization degree. For electrocatalysis, although the electrocatalysis efficiency of AgNP:TiO2 is enhanced, it hard to quantitatively characterize the electron transfer process, because of the contribution of Ag NPs\u2019 intrinsic electrocatalysis. Hence, the transient absorption measurements are used to demonstrate the electron transfer [46\u201348]. Fig. 3 (a) displays the linear absorption spectrum of TiO2 crystal before and after Ag+ ion implantation. Fig. 3(b) indicates the simulated result by Mie theory [49] (See Eq. S(1) in the supplementary materials). The measured and simulated LSPR absorption peak of AgNP:TiO2 is located at 523\u00a0nm, which is agreed with the previously reported data [50]. The pump-probe experiment is carried out to investigate the intrinsic ultrafast nonlinear excitation dynamics, and the schematic of pump-probe experiment is shown in Fig. 3(c). To aviod the influence of near-field enhancement of Ag NPs, the wavelength of pump and probe are set as 1040\u00a0nm, which is far away from the LSPR peak. Multi-photon absorption mechanism is utilized for the excitation of electrons at the ground state of Ag NPs, which has been demonstrated to show saturable absorption response due to the ground state bleaching or full-filled conduction band [51]. The pump-probe result of AgNP:TiO2 and TiO2 is shown in Fig. 3(d). Considering the convolution of the instrument response function with the two decays (The instrument response function can be seen in Fig.S(2) in. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the Supplementary Materials), the pump-probe signal can be expressed as: g(t)=D1exp-t\u03c41erfc\u03c32\u03c41-t2\u03c3+D2exp-t\u03c42erfc\u03c32\u03c42-t2\u03c3 where D 1 and D 2 denote the amplitude of each component, \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 represent the lifetime of the sample, respectively. The \u03c3 is the laser pulse duration and t is the time delay [52]. There is a small but non-negligible long decay component common to both the hybrid system and TiO2. We believe the long decay component of TiO2 may satisfy with phonon-phonon scattering, which may be caused by the energy transfer from the excited TiO2 to the un-irradiated region or the air. The dynamic process of TiO2 has been widely investigated in the previous literature [53,54], and the delay time of electron-phonon scattering is determined to be picosecond timescale. For the sample of AgNP:TiO2, the long decay component of AgTiO2 hybrid system may be caused by the decay back of injected hot electrons from TiO2 to Ag NPs [46]. In addition, the sample of AgNP:TiO2 exhibits an obvious two-component response for pump-probe traces, i.e., two relaxation parts \u03c4 1 (300\u00a0fs) and \u03c4 2 (13\u00a0ps), which represent the contribution of the fast and slow decaying components, respectively. The fast delay time may originate from the carrier-carrier scattering process, which agrees with the well-investigated electron injection timescale (tens to hundreds of fs) in the electron transfer process from metallic NPs to TiO2 [47,55]. It should be noted that our measurement is limited by the temporal resolution of the setup, which means the response of measurement configuration will lead to the inaccuracy of the fast decay time. Therefore, the physical mechanism of the fast delay time is not under further discussion in this work. For slow decay component of AgNP:TiO2, we observe an additional decay time (\u03c4 2) of 13\u00a0ps. We believe the slow component \u03c42 of AgNP:TiO2 comes from the electron-phonon scattering process [56,57]. Typically, the two-temperature model is invoked to explain this phenomenon, which has been well-investigated by many publications [58\u201360]. We believe that electron transfer likely explains the reported pump-probe results. Although the delay time of the electron transfer process is well-studied by pump-probe measurement, it is difficult to verify the direction of electron transfer. Many prior publications reported the electron transfers from TiO2 to metal in the metal-TiO2 system [17,18]. In this work, under the multi-photon excitation of the 1040\u00a0nm, multi-photon excitation in TiO2 maybe lead to excited electron energies that exceed the Schottky barrier, leading to electron transfer from TiO2 to Ag NPs. To further investigate the direction of electron transfer, the OA Z-scan is carried out. When the excitation light is focused on the sample surface, the incident photon energy is absorbed by Ag NPs and TiO2. The electron transfer process can change the electron cloud density, influencing the nonlinear optical response. The experimental arrangement of the OA Z-scan technique is similar to previous works [32,61]. The measured nonlinear transmittance of AgNP:TiO2 and TiO2 are indicated in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively. The relationship between transmittance and optical excitation intensity can be fitted by Eq. (2): T(I)=1-\u0394T\u00d7e-IIsat-TN where T(I) is transmittance, \u0394T represents modulation depth, I is excitation optical intensity, Is denotes saturation intensity, TN is nonsaturable absorbance [62,63]. As shown, the saturation intensity Is of TiO2 crystal is 3.23 GW/cm2 and the modulation depth is 7.6%. With embedded Ag NPs, the modulation depth of the AgNP:TiO2 is almost the same (7.1%). However, the saturation intensity of AgNP:TiO2 (0.76 GW/cm2) decreases by 76.5%. According to the Z-scan measurement, both of the AgNP:TiO2 and TiO2 show saturable absorption. In previous literature, it has been demonstrated that isolated Ag NPs themselves do not show saturable absorption at 1\u00a0\u03bcm, which gives the proof for the electron transfer tailored nonlinearity [11,64]. The direction of electron transfer can be speculated from the decreased saturation intensity and constant modulation depth. For TiO2, electrons at the V. B are excited, occupying the position in C. B. When the C. B. is occupied completely, absorption is saturable. For AgNP:TiO2, the higher absorption efficiency of Ag NPs (compared with that of TiO2) will modify the nonlinear optical response of TiO2 in the presence of electron transfer. More specifically, the high absorption efficiency of Ag NPs can produce more excited electrons at lower excitation intensity, i.e., the saturation intensity is decreased. Besides, the similar modulation depth of AgNP:TiO2 and TiO2 also indicates the correctness of the above conclusion. Since the modulation depth depends on the electron number on C. B. of TiO2 at its full-occupied state, the modulation depth of AgNP:TiO2 and TiO2 will not change. In this way, we believe the direction of electron transfer can be speculated from the decreased saturation intensity and constant modulation depth. In order to further confirm the electron transfer is the main reason for the tailored nonlinear optical response, the near-field distribution has been calculated by the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), as shown in Fig. 4c [65]. Details of the near-field enhancement calculation can be seen in the supplementary materials. Owing to the excitation wavelength far from the LSPR peak, the near field enhancement factors are small with the maximum and minimum of 0.893 and 0.097, respectively. In the meanwhile, the near-field enhancement factor is less than 1, which indicates the LSPR is not enough to explain the reduced saturation intensity. In addition, the modulation depth is constant even slightly decreased, which is different from the prior researches of LSPR induced enhanced modulation depth [66]. Therefore, in this work, the enhanced local optical electric field is not the main reason for nonlinearity modulation. To further prove the above conclusion, 1\u00a0\u03bcm mode-locked pulsed lasers modulated by AgNP:TiO2 and TiO2 SAs have been generated based on the electron transfer tailored nonlinear optical responses. For traditional laser generation system, such as Nd:YAG waveguide laser with NPs as SA, there are only two energy-level-systems, and the cavity energy generated by gain medium is simply tailored by SA. Here, we introduce a modulator into the traditional laser cavity to build three energy-level-systems, and the electron transfer process can. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "connect each part. The schematic diagram of mode-locked pulsed laser generation process is shown in Fig. 5 , including Nd:YAG (gain medium), Ag NPs (modulator) and TiO2 (SA). Under the excitation of continuous-wave laser at 808\u00a0nm, all the three systems are integrated into a tiny waveguide laser cavity. After the spontaneous emission and stimulated emission in Nd:YAG energy-level-system, the generated 1064\u00a0nm laser is absorbed by Ag NPs, and the electrons in V. B. are excited to C. B. of Ag NPs. As we mentioned before, these electrons will occupy positions of electrons in C. B. of TiO2 by electron transfer process, resulting in the decrease of saturation intensity of TiO2. Therefore, the modified TiO2 shows an enhanced ability to tailor the energy in the resonant cavity. Fig. 6 (a) illustrates the mode-locked pulse train on the time scale of 250\u00a0ps/div with pulse duration of single mode-locked pulse trace as short as 16.8\u00a0ps. The repetition rate of the generated laser is up to 26.4\u00a0GHz, which corresponds to the fourth harmonic mode-locking. Fig. 6(b) indicates the average output powers of the pulsed lasers based on AgNP:TiO2 SA and TiO2 SA as functions of launched power at TE polarization. Laser oscillation happens when the launched power is higher than the threshold value of 0.6 mW (10.5 mW) for pulsed laser based on AgNP:TiO2 (TiO2) SA. Q-switched mode-locked pulses based on AgNP:TiO2 and TiO2 SAs are indicated in Fig. 6(c) and (d), respectively. Efficient mode-locked pulsed laser based on AgNP:TiO2 SA has been achieved at lower pump power (4.0 mW) compared with TiO2-based lasing (4.2 mW), which benefits from the reduced saturation intensity. More details about the characterization of generated laser can be seen in Fig. S2 in the supplementary materials. It is worth noting that, there are significant differences between this work and prior works on the physical mechanisms. In the previous publications [11], metallic NPs were synthesized on the insulator matrixes with reverse saturable absorption, meanwhile, the embedded NPs exhibited saturable absorption response owing to the LSPR effect. Based on the competition and overlay of the two different types of nonlinearities in the nanocomposites, the nonlinear optical response could be modulated to realize saturable absorption for laser generation. In this work, different from the above mechanism, the electron transfer process plays a crucial role in the tailoring of the saturable absorption of TiO2 semiconductors, which shows significant potential for the optimization of ultrafast laser generation.  In summary, the embedded Ag NPs are synthesized by using Ag+ ion implantation on TiO2 crystal. The electron transfer process between Ag NPs and TiO2 semiconductor is investigated by catalysis and electrocatalysis efficiency of AgNP:TiO2 is enhanced. Z-scan and pump-probe measurements qualitatively prove the existence of the electron transfer process between Ag NPs and TiO2 semiconductor. The increased absorption efficiency by Ag NPs is proposed and confirmed to modify the nonlinear optical response by the electron transfer process, leading to a reduction of saturation intensity and constant modulation depth. Finally, based on the decreased saturation intensity (decreased by 76.5%), 1\u00a0\u03bcm low-threshold mode-locked lasers have been realized with AgNP:TiO2 SA tailored by the electron transfer process between NPs and the conduction of TiO2, confirming the reasonability between the observed phenomenon and theoretical model about electron transfer.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

TiO2 typically exists as three types of polymorphs: anatase, rutile and brookite []. With the recent development of improved methods for synthesis of brookite TiO2, many investigations of its photocatalytic properties have been carried out. It has been shown that brookite TiO2 is superior for photocatalytic reactions than those of anatase and rutile due to the appropriate depth of electron traps, which greatly benefits the overall photocatalytic activity []. However, the photoabsorption of brookite TiO2 is limited to UV light as is rutile TiO2 and anatase TiO2, which greatly hinders the utilization of solar energy and practical applications in photocatalytic decompositions especially indoors []. Therefore, it is critical to develop the visible-light response of brookite TiO2 for photocatalysis by enhancing its ability to absorb and harvest visible light. Surface plasmon resonances of metallic nanoparticles provide an efficient strategy for obtaining advanced photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices. As the most important and common co-catalysts, Ag and Au have been studied extensively because of their LSPR effect on semiconductor photocatalysts, which could not only promote visible light absorption but also charge separation. For instance, an Ag-TiO2 composite catalyst [], Ag@TiO2 nanorods [], Au-TiO2 [] and Ag-TiO2 plasmonic hybrid nanocomposites [] have been prepared and shown greatly enhanced visible-light-responsive photocatalytic performance. However, pure Au nanoparticles exhibit low LSPR effect and Ag nanoparticles demonstrate poor stability under visible light. Hence, AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles attracted much attention due to the synergistic effect of Ag and Au, enabling good stability and excellent LSPR effect. Tahir et al. reported a synergistic effect of plasmonic Au/Ag alloy nanoparticles used for coating TiO2 nanowires on visible-light-promoted photoreduction of CO2 to fuels []. Huang\u2019s group validated the superiority of gold-silver-modified plasmonic photoanodes for solar cells with high efficiency under visible light []. Therefore, it is highly desirable to investigate the LSPR effect of AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles on brookite TiO2, developing efficient visible-light-driven photocatalyst. In this study, well-defined AuAg-brookite TiO2 nanorods were fabricated by selectively loading AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles on morphology-controlled brookite TiO2 nanorods. The efficient LSPR effect of AuAg nanoparticles on reduction facets of brookite TiO2 nanorods remarkably enhanced visible-light absorption and charge separation, thus improving visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance. The combination of Au and Ag enables not only superior LSPR activity but also good stability, making it an ideal material for modifying brookite TiO2 nanorods. Furthermore, 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-brookite showed high level of acetone production for decomposition of 2-propnal under visible light illumination, which is about 3 and 4 times of those of 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2 and 0.5\u2009wt% Au-TiO2. The results of this study provide insights for the development of efficient visible-light-responsive photocatalytic performance of brookite TiO2 nanorods by introducing the LSPR effect of AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles.  All of the chemical materials used in this study were analytical grade and used without further purification. The resistivity of the deionized water used in all of the reactions was 18.25\u2009M\u03a9\u2009cm. Brookite TiO2 nanorods were prepared through a facial hydrothermal reaction according to a reported method []. Urea (21.02\u2009g) was dissolved in titanium bis(ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH, 5\u2009mL) and deionized water (45\u2009mL) with stirring for 2\u2009h. Then the uniform mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon cup and kept at 200\u2009\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. When the autoclave had cooled down to room temperature, the samples were collected by centrifugation until the ionic strength of the filtrate was less than 10\u2009\u03bcs\u2009cm\u22121. Finally, pure brookite TiO2 nanorods could be obtained by drying at 60\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009h in a vacuum oven. To remove the organic compounds that may have remained or had been adsorbed on the surface of brookite TiO2 nanorods, the products were irradiated with a 500\u2009W mercury lamp (Ushio, SX-UI501UO) for 24\u2009h. Commercial brookite TiO2 was purchased from High Purity Materials Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co. LTD. AgAu bimetallic nanoparticles were loaded on the as-prepared brookite TiO2 nanorods through a photo-reduction method. Firstly, 0.4\u2009g brookite TiO2 nanorod was dispersed in distilled water (10\u2009mL) and methanol (10\u2009mL). Then the mixed solution was bubbled with nitrogen for 1\u2009h and irradiated with UV light (220\u2009mW cm\u22122). During the irradiation, 0.05\u2009M silver nitrate was added at first. After 15\u2009min, 0.029\u2009M HAuCl4 was added to the solution and its addition was repeated for 4 times. In order to control the loading amount of Au and Ag, the volume of added solution was regulated. More specifically, the loading amount of AuAg was confined to 0.25\u2009wt%, 0.5\u2009wt%, 0.75\u2009wt% and 1.0\u2009wt%, in which the molar ratio of Au and Ag is 1:1. For comparison, 0.5\u2009wt% AgAu nanoparticles was also loaded on commercial brookite TiO2 by the same procedure. The crystalline phase of as-prepared samples was investigated by using a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument (MiniFlex II, Rigaku Co.). The morphologies and nanostructures of the samples were characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6701FONO) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi, H-9000NAR, 200\u2009kV). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained through a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN (30\u2009kV). The surface area of the samples were obtained from a Quantachrome Nova 4200e using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra showing the optical properties of samples were obtained by a UV-2500PC (Shimadzu) equipped with an integrating sphere unit. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained by a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi system at room temperature using Al K\u03b1 with monochromatic radiation. Apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at wavelengths from 400 to 600\u2009nm was recorded by the ratio of acetone production and amount of incident photons by using a Xe lamp equipped with a band-pass filter (Asahi Spectra Co., Ltd.) centered at 400\u2009nm, 450\u2009nm, 470\u2009nm, 500\u2009nm, 550\u2009nm and 600\u2009nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were characterized by the PF-8500 spectrometer using the excitation wavelength of 350\u2009nm. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by decomposition of 2-propanol in gas phase. The photocatalyst (200\u2009mg) was spread on a glass dish (4 cm2) and the glass dish was put into a Tedlar bag (AS ONE Co.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Ltd.) with a volume of 125\u2009mL mixed air (79% N2, 21% O2, <0.1\u2009ppm of CO2, 500\u2009ppm of 2-propanol). Before visible-light irradiation, the photocatalyst was left in the dark for 1\u2009h to reach adsorption equilibrium. Then the photocatalyst was illuminated by visible light of 100\u2009mW cm\u22122 (or 50\u2009mW cm-2) from a Xenon lamp equipped with a Yellow-44 filter. The concentration evolutions of 2-propanol, CO2 and acetone during the photocatalytic process were determined by gas chromatography (Agilent/Inficon 3000 Micro GC) with a PLOT U column and OV-1 column.  The nanorod shape of brookite TiO2 is shown by SEM images in Fig. 1 . It can be clearly seen that ordered nanorods with lengths of about 110\u2009nm and widths of 20\u2009nm have smooth surfaces and triangular-like tips at the ends of the rods (Fig. 1B). As reported previously, a nanorod shows a large {210} crystal face and a small {212} crystal face in the flank and top of brookite TiO2, corresponding to reduction and oxidation facets, respectively [,]. Moreover, the large proportion of reduction sites in as-prepared brookite TiO2 provides numerous active sites for photoreduction. As expected, the nanorod shape was preserved well and there were few nanoparticles distributed on the reduction facets of brookite TiO2 nanorods after loading the AuAg nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 1D. The TEM images in Fig. 2 show the specific morphology of pure brookite TiO2 nanorods and the existence of nanoparticles in the modified brookite TiO2 nanorods. The TEM image of samples shows a rod-like shape with a triangular end and a tetragonal brookite structure, being consistent with the SEM images. The spacing lattices of 0.35\u2009nm and 0.29\u2009nm in HRTEM image derived from the bare nanorods marked with dotted line circle in TEM image can be assigned to the (210) and (211) facets of brookite TiO2, which are identified as the reduction and oxidation facets [,]. Most importantly, nanoparticles (marked with dotted line circle in Fig. 2B and D) with diameters of about 10\u2009nm are distributed on the (210) crystal plane. This also confirms that the (210) crystal plane of brookite TiO2 nanorods provides reduction sites for depositing noble metals. The loaded AuAg nanoparticles on brookite TiO2 nanorods were further confirmed by EELS (Fig. 2F). It can be seen that Au and Ag have a fitted distribution on the characteristic nanorod shape of TiO2, demonstrating that the AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles have been successfully located on the as-prepared TiO2 nanorods. The loading amount of AuAg on brookite TiO2 nanorods can be theoretically regulated by controlling the volume of the precursor solution. With an increase in the loading amount of AuAg, the nanoparticles become more obvious in SEM images. As depicted, The AuAg nanoparticles can hardly be seen in 0.25\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 3 A) due to the relatively small loading amount. When the weight percentage of AuAg was increased to 0.5\u2009wt%, a small amount of nanoparticles was distributed on the TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 1D). However, a large amount of nanoparticles was deposited on the nanorods for 0.75\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 and 1.0\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods. It is notable that all of the nanoparticles were distributed on the reduction facets of nanorods, suggesting that the photoreduction reaction occurred on a specific crystal plane with separation of the reduction and oxidation sites in the brookite TiO2 nanorods. For comparison, pure 0.5\u2009wt% Au-loaded brookite TiO2 and 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-loaded brookite TiO2 nanorods were synthesized, and SEM images are shown in Fig. 3. As in the case of 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2, the Au-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 nanorods had few nanoparticles on the reduction crystal planes of the nanorods. It was confirmed that pristine Au nanoparticles and Ag nanoparticles can be formed by photoreduction. For comparison, the SEM image of commercial brookite was also characterized. It is observed that commercial brookite is composed of stacked nanoparticles with diameter of nearly 20\u2009nm. The XRD patterns were characterized and are shown in Fig. 4 , revealing the crystalline structure and crystal phase of samples. The peaks of pure nanorods can be well indexed to brookite TiO2 (JCPDS: 00-015-0875) [,] without other impurity peaks, indicating high purity. Furthermore, the samples with different loading amounts of AuAg exhibited peaks that agreed well with the pristine brookite TiO2 nanorods and no peak of Au or Ag, which is thought to be due to the small amount and good dispersion of loaded metals on the brookite TiO2 nanorods. Similarly, there was no sign of Au (JCPDS: 65\u20132870) and Ag (JCPDS: 65\u20132871) [,] in the as-prepared Au-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 as shown in Fig. 4C and 4D. The optical properties of TiO2, Au-TiO2, Ag-TiO2 and AuAg-TiO2 were revealed by the UV\u2013vis DR and absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5 . The pure brookite TiO2 shows an absorption edge at 380\u2009nm in the UV light region, suggesting that pure brookite TiO2 nanorods can not be excited by visible light. However, Au-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 show absorption peaks at 547 and 467\u2009nm, respectively, which are assigned to the LSPR effect of Au and Ag on brookite TiO2 []. It is worth notable that the AuAg-TiO2 nanorods showed absorption in a wide range of 400\u2013600\u2009nm due to the LSPR effect of both Au and Ag nanoparticles. This also implies that Au and Ag have a synergistic effect of LSPR for brookite TiO2 nanorods and greatly improve the visible-light absorptivity. Moreover, visible-light absorption is enhanced with an increase in the loading amount of AuAg nanoparticles. Table 1 shows the BET surface areas of the as-prepared samples. The commercial brookite samples present surface area of 38.1\u2009m2\u2009g\u22121, which is much smaller than that of as-prepared brookite TiO2 nanorods. It can be seen that brookite TiO2 nanorods had a surface area of 77.3\u2009m2\u2009g\u22121, which provides numerous active sites for loading the AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles and photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the surface area of the samples showed a slight decrease with an increase in the loading amount of AuAg nanoparticles. To demonstrate the LSPR effect of AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles on the reduction facets of brookite TiO2 nanorods, the photocatalytic activities of pristine brookite TiO2 nanorods and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "AuAg-brookite TiO2 nanorods for oxidation of 2-propanol were evaluated. Fig. 6 A and B show the time courses of acetone evolution and CO2 evolution from different photocatalysts under visible light illumination (440\u2009<\u2009\u03bb\u2009<\u2009800\u2009nm). It can be clearly seen that the brookite TiO2 nanorods exhibited a weak visible-light-driven response and almost no photocatalytic performance under dark conditions. The weak visible-light-driven response is thought to be resulted from the defects in the as-obtained brookite TiO2 nanorods. Both surface and bulk oxygen vacancies would have functions in the photo-reaction process. Light absorption of photocatalysts can be improved by surface and bulk oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancies promote charge separation, while the bulk vacancies act as recombination center of photogenerated electrons and holes [,]. As characterized by the UV\u2013vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5B), the as-prepared brookite TiO2 shows no visible light absorption, indicating that the weak visible-light-driven photocatalytic response is mainly originated from the surface vacancies. After loading AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles on the brookite TiO2 nanorods, the photocatalytic properties were remarkably improved. The 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods showed the highest photocatalytic activity among the AuAg-loaded brookite TiO2 nanorods tested, yielding 102\u2009ppm of acetone when irradiated for 5\u2009h with visible light. It is notable that the yield of acetone increased almost linearly over the 5-h period and then decreased due to the saturation of acetone on the surface of the photoatalysts and the decomposition from acetone to the final product, CO2 []. However, the acetone production of brookite TiO2 nanorods is only 25\u2009ppm even irradiated by visible light for 5\u2009h. Similarly, the 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods showed the highest level of CO2 production during the photocatalytic process. Based on these results, it was concluded that the amount of AuAg nanoparticles has an important effect on the surface plasmon-induced photocatalytic activity. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of AuAg-TiO2 was found to be strongly dependent on the light intensity as shown in Fig. 6C and D. The acetone evolution in the case of illumination by visible light with intensity of 50\u2009mW cm\u22122 showed a linear increase with extension of time to 12\u2009h, indicating that the yield of acetone did not reach saturation during the photocatalytic process. In contrast, the saturated production of acetone can be obtained at 6\u2009h in the case of 100\u2009mW cm-2 visible light irradiation. However, it is should be noted that the CO2 production over the 12-h period showed a linear increase with an increase of visible light intensity. The results suggested that the photocatalytic performance is triggered by photocatalytic oxidation over AuAg nanoparticles or the thermal effect related to photoabsorption of incident light. An action spectrum was obtained to reveal the factor determining the photocatalytic reaction and LSPR induced visible light responsibility of AuAg-TiO2 nanorods. An AQE plot (Fig. 7 A) of AuAg-TiO2 corresponds well to the Kubelka-Munk function, indicating that the photocatalytic behavior is induced by photoabsorption based on the LSPR effect of Au and Ag nanoparticles []. For comparison, the photocatalytic properties of pure Ag-TiO2 and Au-TiO2 were investigated to confirm the superiority of AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles. As demonstrated in Fig. 7B and C, 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 showed remarkably higher production levels of acetone and CO2 than those of 0.5\u2009wt% Au-TiO2 and 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2. Moreover, the Au-TiO2 nanorods showed the lowest photocatalytic activity among the samples tested, indicating a weak LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles on photocatalytic performance []. The acetone production derived by 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 is about 3 and 4 times of those of 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2 and 0.5\u2009wt% Au-TiO2, respectively. It has been proposed that the introduction of Au into Ag can greatly enhance the stability of Ag nanoparticles as well as preserve the high activity, which would provide an excellent LSPR effect []. Besides the enhanced visible light absorption of AuAg-TiO2 verified by UV\u2013vis absorption spectra, the PL intensities (Fig. 7D) of TiO2 and metal loaded TiO2 were measured to investigate the charge separation efficiency. The PL emission located at about 520\u2009nm corresponds to the charge transfer transition of trapped electrons in oxygen vacancy and plasma particles [,]. As the PL emission is a result of recombination of electrons and holes, the quenching of photoluminescence validates the efficient charge separation. It is well observed that the modified brookite TiO2 nanorods exhibit decreased PL peak intensity, confirming enhanced charge separation by metal deposition. More specifically, 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods showed higher charge separation efficiency than those of TiO2, Au-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 samples being consistent with the excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. Moreover, Au-TiO2 showed a much higher recombination rate of electrons and holes than that of Ag-TiO2, indicating a weaker LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles than that of Ag nanoparticles on brookite TiO2 nanorods. Based on these result, it is concluded that the combination of Au and Ag could provide a strong LSPR effect as well as stable Ag under visible light illumination, enabling the transfer of excited electrons from AuAg nanoparticles to the conduction band of TiO2. As a result, the charge separation of AuAg-TiO2 was greatly enhanced, being closely related to the photocatalytic activity. In order to confirm the valence states of Ag, XPS measurements were performed on Ag-TiO2 and 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 before and after photocatalytic tests (Fig. 8 ). For 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2 nanorods, the Ag 3d XPS pattern showed binding energies of Ag at 374.2\u2009eV and 368.6\u2009eV and binding energies of Ag+ at 365.8\u2009eV and 371.8\u2009eV, confirming the co-existence of Ag and Ag2O [,]. Furthermore, the binding energy peak of Ag+ was much higher than that of Ag, suggesting that Ag had been greatly oxidized before utilization. After photodecomposition, the peaks of Ag decreased and the binding energies of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 of Ag+ at 365.8\u2009eV and 371.8\u2009eV in the 3d XPS pattern exhibit strong intensities, indicating that the pure Ag nanoparticles were highly unstable and oxidized during the photocatalytic process. However, the Ag 3d XPS spectra of 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods showed great differences from those of 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2. The Ag 3d XPS pattern of 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 before the photocatalytic test showed strong peaks of Ag. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "at about 374.2\u2009eV and 368.6\u2009eV and weak peaks of Ag+, suggesting that AuAg bimetallic metals benefit the stability of Ag. On the other hand, the binding energy peak of Ag+ increased greatly after the photocatalytic test, indicating that Ag was partially oxidized during the photocatalytic reaction []. These results suggest that Ag is easily oxidized in the process of photocatalytic reaction. Apart from the advantages of AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles, control of the morphology of brookite TiO2 nanorods contributes to the high photocatalytic performance, as was confirmed by a comparison of photocatalytic activities of 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-brookite TiO2 and 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-commercial brookite TiO2 (Fig. 9 ). It should be mentioned that the production levels of acetone and CO2 derived from the AuAg-commercial brookite TiO2 were only about half of those generated over AuAg-brookite TiO2. It is thought that selective loading of AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles on the reduction sites of brookite TiO2 effectively promote charge separation and the large surface area of brookite nanorods (Table 1) furnishes numerous active sites, which are responsible for the superior photocatalytic activity. More specifically, the photogenerated electrons are transferred from AuAg nanoparticles to the reduction sites of brookite TiO2 nanorods and take part in the reduction process, decreasing the recombination of electrons and holes. However, AuAg nanoparticles are deposited randomly on commercial brookite TiO2 particle and then the photogenerated electrons move from AuAg to brookite TiO2 under visible-light irradiation. The mixed electrons and holes in AuAg-commercial TiO2 would increase the recombination rate, leading to low photocatalytic activity. The cycling stabilities of the 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2 nanorods and 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 are shown in Fig. 10 . Cycling stability is an important factor for practical applications of photocatalysts. Notably, acetone evolution from 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2 showed a significant decrease at the second photocatalytic application compared to that in the initial photocatalytic test. Moreover, a comparison of the decay efficiencies of photocatalytic activity of AuAg-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 confirmed the superiority of AuAg-loaded brookite TiO2 nanorods. After 3 cycles, the photocatalytic efficiency of 0.5\u2009wt% Ag-TiO2 had decreased to 41.2% of that in the initial test. However, the acetone production over 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods was as high as 64\u2009ppm at 5\u2009h after 3 cycles, which was 62.7% of the initial production, indicating that AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles are effective and stable during the photocatalytic reaction []. Based on the above results, it can be concluded that the introduction of Au into Ag nanoparticles effectively enhances the photocatalytic stability. As shown in Fig. 10C, Ag and Au nanoparticles provide photogenerated electrons to brookite TiO2 under visible light. The photogenerated electrons directly participate in the reduction reaction and the holes left in the metals participate in the oxidation reaction, enabling efficient charge separation. Since the Ag nanoparticles are easily to be oxidized to Ag2O during the photocatalytic process, the photocatalytic stability of Ag-TiO2 is unsatisfactory. As Au nanoparticles have good stability and a weak LSPR effect, the combination of Au and Ag would provide good stability and a high level of activity. UV-visible DR and absorption spectra (Fig. 11 ) of AuAg-TiO2 and Ag-TiO2 after photocatalytic cycling tests were obtained to confirm the aforementioned proposal. For AuAg-TiO2, the absorption peak showed a red shift in the first photocatalytic test and almost no change in the second and third photocatalytic tests. The obvious red-shift of absorption peak is proposed to be devoted to the partial oxidation of Ag during the photocatalytic reaction, which has been confirmed by the Ag 3d XPS pattern as shown in Fig. 8. Importantly, the intensity of the absorption peak derived from the LSPR effect showed a slight decrease after photocatalytic cycling characterization that is related to the good photocatalytic stability. However, the LSPR effect of Ag-TiO2 showed a significant decrease after the photocatalytic process, corresponding to the oxidation of Ag nanoparticles. After 3 photocatalytic tests, Ag in TiO2-Ag has bad been greatly oxidized due to the weak absorption in the visible light range, being consistent with the low level of photocatalytic activity. It was confirmed that the design of AuAg nanoparticles could effectively facilitate the stability of Ag nanoparticles and high photocatalytic performance.  In summary, AuAg nanoparticles were photoreduced on the reduction crystal planes of brookite TiO2 nanorods, greatly promoting visible-light-induced photocatalytic activities. The selectively deposited AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles provide not only a strong LSPR effect but also good stability, resulting in excellent photocatalytic performance of AuAg-TiO2 nanorods for decomposition of 2-propanol. By regulating the amount of loaded AuAg nanoparticles, a significantly high level of photocatalytic activity could be obtained by 0.5\u2009wt% AuAg-TiO2 nanorods. This strategy offers an effective method for developing visible-light-responsive photocatalysts as well as for investigating the LSPR effect of AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles on brookite TiO2 nanorods.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Since the minimum feature size of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has shrunk into sub-65 nm technologies, high-k dielectric materials have been investigated to employ ZrO2/Al2O3/ZrO2 (ZAZ) as capacitor dielectrics in metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM) capacitors . Capacitor dielectric materials grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been employed to take advantage of the delicately controlled uniformity and thickness of thin-films on the surface due to its slow growth characteristics . Additionally, Al2O3 has been actively studied as a back-surface field (BSF) material for p-type Si substrates in crystalline Si solar cells to reduce the electron\u2013hole recombination rate . Theoretical studies of the initial Al2O3 thin-film growth with Al precursors such as aluminum tri-chloride (AlCl3) and tri-methylaluminum (Al(CH3)3, TMA) on a Si surface have been researched using density functional theory (DFT). Widjaja and Musgrave and Heyman and Musgrave studied the chemical reaction of TMA and AlCl3 with H2O to form Al2O3. Energy barriers for reactions of TMA and AlCl3 with H2O were 0.91 and 1.26 eV, respectively. However, these studies only considered the interaction between molecules without a surface. Halls and Raghavachari reported TMA and H2O reactions with an H2O-terminated Si (0 0 1) surface . An energy barrier of 0.19 eV was needed for the TMA reaction with the surface to produce a di-methylaluminum (\u2013Al(CH3)2, DMA) group. The intuitive determination of the transition state for the TMA reaction, however, underestimated its energy barrier. Furthermore, Ghosh and Choi reported the initial reaction mechanism of TMA for the Al2O3 thin-film growth on a fully OH-terminated Si (0 0 1) surface . The TMA reaction to form a DMA group and DMA group reaction to form a uni-methylaluminum (\u2013AlCH3, UMA) group required energy barriers of 0.72 and 0.84 eV, respectively. However, these reaction energy barriers were high because they did not consider the relaxed transition states for the energy barrier calculations. In addition, many calculation studies did not consider the interaction between molecules on the surface, due to the small surface size to keep the computation power under certain level. The interaction between TMA molecules is very important, when it comes to understanding the first half-cycle of the ALD process and its step coverage. In this paper, the interaction between TMA molecules on a fully OH-terminated Si (0 0 1) surface was investigated using DFT. The 4 \u00d7 4 Si (0 0 1) surface size was employed to consider the interaction between the TMA molecules/groups to understand the initial ALD process more realistically. Therefore, we were able to consider the surface chemistry during the first half-cycle of the ALD process as a function of the substrate surface temperature.  All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code . Electron wave functions were described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method of Bl\u00f6chl that was implemented to the code by Kresse and Joubert . The exchange correlation energy was described by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) . The residual minimization method of direct inversion in the iterative subspace (RMM-DIIS) was used to calculate the ground state of electrons . More precisely, Si atom [Ne]3s23p2 states, O atom [He]2s32p4 states, Al atom [Ne]3s23p1 states, C atom [He]2s22p4 states, and H atom 1s1 state were treated as valence wave functions. The cutoff energy of 500 eV was used, and 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 k-points mesh with zero shift for the slap superstructure including a 20 \u00c5 thick vacuum layer was used to generate the plane wave basis set using the Monkhorst\u2013Pack grid method . Partial wave occupancies were calculated with the Gaussian smearing method, and its factor was 0.05 eV. Electronic and geometry optimizations were converged when the total energy difference between successive calculation steps was less than 10\u22123 and 10\u22122 eV, respectively. All atoms were allowed to relax until the force on each atom was below 0.02 eV/\u00c5. Energy barriers were calculated for the TMA reaction to form a DMA group with the fully OH-terminated 4 \u00d7 4 Si (0 0 1) surface, DMA group migration, and DMA group reaction to form a UMA group with the surface. Fig. 1(a) shows the fully OH-terminated 4 \u00d7 4 Si (0 0 1) surface with three surface sites; inter-dimer, intra-dimer, and inter-row sites. One bottom Si layer among four Si layers with H atoms underneath were fixed, and three top Si layers with \u2013OH's on top were allowed to relax, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The H atoms were attached to the bottom Si atoms to remove their dangling bonds. The numbers of Si, H, and O atoms for the 4 \u00d7 4 Si (0 0 1) surface are 64, 48, and 16, respectively. Another TMA (the second TMA) was introduced to the surface, and its adsorption on the surface was considered with the previously adsorbed TMA (the first TMA) or formed group (the first DMA or UMA group), and energy barriers were calculated for their reactions with the surface. There was a strong interaction between molecules when the second TMA was located near the first TMA or group. Energy barrier calculations were carried out using the climbing nudged elastic band (CNEB) tool implemented in the VASP code. The CNEB tool was used to find saddle points and minimum energy paths between known reactants and products . Six images including the initial and final states were used for the CNEB calculations. Atoms in \u2018Relaxed layers\u2019 shown in Fig. 1(b) and TMA's were allowed to relax during the energy barrier calculations.  The second TMA reaction with the presence of the first TMA, DMA group, or UMA group (molecule/group) on the fully OH-terminated Si (0 0 1) surface will be discussed. Firstly, the first TMA reaction is briefly described. Secondly, the second TMA reaction will be discussed,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "when the second TMA is located close to the first molecule/group. Thirdly, the second TMA reaction with varying distance with the presence of the first molecule/group will be presented. Finally, an initial ALD growth mechanism for the Al2O3 thin-film will be discussed from these results. Fig. 2 shows energy barriers for the single TMA reaction with the fully OH-terminated Si (0 0 1) surface. These results were published elsewhere and will be described briefly here to aid in discussion about the interaction of TMA molecules . A relative energy is set to 0 eV as a reference, when TMA is located further away from the surface with a distance of 10 \u00c5. When TMA approached the surface, the Al atom of TMA was adsorbed on the O atom of \u2013OH due to its lone pair electrons without any energy barrier, and the adsorption energy was \u22120.70 eV. The adsorbed TMA reacts with \u2013OH to produce a DMA group and methane (CH4), and its reaction formula is given by: \u2013OH + Al(CH3)3 \u2192 \u2013O\u2013Al(CH3)2 + CH4. The energy further decreased to \u22121.57 from \u22120.70 eV, and its reaction energy barrier of 0.50 eV was required. The formed DMA group migrated to the inter-dimer site without any energy barrier, and the energy further decreased to \u22122.19 from \u22121.57 eV. The migrated DMA group reacts with \u2013OH to produce a UMA group and CH4, and its reaction formula is given by: \u2013O\u2013Al(CH3)2 \u2192 \u2013O\u2013AlCH3\u2013O\u2013 + CH4. The energy further decreased to \u22122.89 from \u22122.19 eV, and the UMA group was produced at the inter-dimer site with an energy barrier of 0.21 eV. The second TMA adsorption and reactions were considered, when the first TMA, DMA group, and UMA group were previously adsorbed and formed on the fully OH-terminated Si (0 0 1) surface. Fig. 3 shows energy barriers for the second TMA reaction close to the first TMA with the surface while the first TMA is adsorbed on the surface. A relative energy is set to 0 eV as a reference, when the second TMA is located further away from the surface with a distance of 10 \u00c5 while the first TMA is adsorbed on the surface. When the second TMA approached the surface vertically, the Al atom of the second TMA was adsorbed on the O atom of \u2013OH due to its lone pair electrons as before, and the adsorption energy was \u22120.25 eV, which was higher than that of the single TMA adsorption (\u22120.70 eV, as shown in Fig. 2). A distance between the Al atom of the second TMA and the O atom of \u2013OH (Al\u22efO) was 2.05 \u00c5 that was longer than that of the single TMA adsorption (2.02 \u00c5), and the Al\u22efO distance of the first TMA adsorption decreased to 1.99 from 2.02 \u00c5. These results are caused by the repulsive interaction between one \u2013CH3 of the second TMA and two \u2013CH3's of the first TMA. Due to this repulsive interaction, the distance between the C atom of \u2013CH3 in the second TMA and the H atom of \u2013OH (C\u22efH) increased to 3.12 \u00c5, relative to 2.70 \u00c5 of the first TMA case. Since the C\u22efH distance was large, a high energy barrier of 0.79 eV was required for the second TMA reaction with \u2013OH to produce a DMA group and CH4. In the case of the formed second DMA group, the Al\u22efO distance of the first TMA increased to 2.01 from 1.99 \u00c5, and an Al\u2013O bond length of the formed second DMA group was 1.72 \u00c5. Moreover, the energy further decreased to \u22121.52 from \u22120.25 eV. The formed second DMA group migrated to the inter-dimer site without any energy barrier, and the energy further decreased to \u22122.18 from \u22121.52 eV. Additionally, the Al\u2013O bond length of the migrated second DMA group increased to 1.76 from 1.72 \u00c5 due to the attraction of the Al atom of the second DMA group with the neighboring O atom of \u2013OH near it. Finally, an energy barrier of 0.22 eV was required for the migrated DMA group reaction with \u2013OH to produce a UMA group and CH4. The Al\u2013O bond length of the formed second UMA group decreased to 1.73 from 1.76 \u00c5. Those energy barriers for the second DMA group migration and reaction are similar to those of the single DMA group migration and reaction. Fig. 4 shows energy barriers for the second TMA reaction with the surface, when the first DMA group is formed at the inter-dimer site on the surface. A relative energy is set to 0 eV as a reference, when the second TMA is located further away from the surface with a distance of 10 \u00c5 while the first DMA group is present on the surface. When the second TMA approached the surface, the Al atom of the second TMA was adsorbed with an Al\u22efO distance of 2.03 \u00c5 due to lone pair electrons of the O atom of \u2013OH on the surface, as before. Additionally, the adsorption energy was \u22120.52 eV, which was higher than that of the single TMA adsorption (\u22120.70 eV, as shown in Fig. 2) due to the repulsive interaction between one \u2013CH3 of the first DMA group and one \u2013CH3 of the second TMA. A high energy barrier of 0.68 eV was required due to a long C\u22efH distance of 2.97 \u00c5 for the adsorbed second TMA reaction with \u2013OH to produce a DMA group and CH4. Moreover, during the reaction process, the second DMA group became located at the inter-dimer site with an Al\u2013O bond length of 1.77 \u00c5, and the energy further decreased to \u22122.12 from \u22120.52 eV. The formed second DMA group at the inter-dimer site reacted with \u2013OH to produce a UMA group and CH4, and its reaction energy barrier of 0.19 eV was required. Additionally, the energy further decreased to \u22122.99 from \u22122.12 eV. The energy barrier for the second DMA group reaction is similar to that of the single DMA group reaction (0.21 eV,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "as shown in Fig. 2). Fig. 5 shows energy barriers for the second TMA reaction with the surface when the first UMA group is formed at the inter-dimer site on the surface. A relative energy is set to 0 eV as a reference, when the second TMA is located further away from the surface with a distance of 10 \u00c5 while the first UMA group is present on the surface. The adsorption energy was \u22121.22 eV, which was lower than that of the single TMA adsorption (\u22120.70 eV, as shown in Fig. 2). The Al atom of the second TMA was located on the O atom of \u2013OH with an Al\u22efO distance of 1.93 \u00c5 that was shorter than that of the single TMA adsorption (2.02 \u00c5). The stronger adsorption and shorter Al\u22efO distance are due to the attractive interactions between the Al atom of the first UMA group and one \u2013CH3 of the second TMA, and between the Al atom of the second TMA and the O atom of \u2013OH on the surface. When the second TMA reacted with \u2013OH to produce a DMA group and CH4, its reaction energy barrier of 1.01 eV was required due to the strong adsorption energy (\u22121.22 eV). The second DMA group was formed with an Al\u2013O bond length of 1.71 \u00c5, and the energy further decreased to \u22121.77 from \u22121.22 eV. The formed second DMA group migrated to the inter-dimer site without any energy barrier, and the Al\u2013O bond length increased to 1.77 from 1.71 \u00c5 due to attraction of the Al atom of the DMA group with the neighboring O atom of \u2013OH near it. Additionally, the energy further decreased to \u22122.20 from \u22121.77 eV. The migrated second DMA group reacted with \u2013OH to produce a UMA group and CH4, and its reaction energy barrier was 0.20 eV. This value is similar to that of the single DMA group reaction (0.21 eV, as shown in Fig. 2). When the second UMA group was formed at the inter-dimer site, the Al\u2013O bond length of the second UMA group decreased to 1.73 from 1.77 \u00c5 and the energy further decreased to \u22122.96 from \u22122.20 eV. Other energy barriers for reactions and migrations of the second TMA with varying distance from the first molecule/group on the surface were calculated, as shown in Fig. 6 . As mentioned previously, high energy barriers of 0.79, 0.68, and 1.01 eV for the second TMA reactions were required due to the interaction of \u2013CH3 \u2013 \u2013CH3 and Al \u2013 \u2013CH3, when the second TMA's were adsorbed close to the first TMA, DMA group, and UMA group, respectively. Energy barriers in the range of 0.49\u20130.52 eV for the second TMA reactions were similar to that of the single TMA reaction (0.50 eV, as shown in Fig. 2), when the second TMA's were located away from the first molecule/group. The formed second DMA groups migrated to the inter-dimer site without any energy barrier. The migrated second DMA groups reacted with \u2013OH to form UMA groups with energy barriers in the range of 0.19\u20130.21 eV. Those values are similar to that of the single DMA group reaction. Therefore, the second TMA reactions are less probable to occur when the second TMA is located close to the first molecule/group. Fig. 7 shows the schematic images of TMA adsorption and reaction during the first half-cycle of the ALD process for the initial Al2O3 thin-film growth with the variation of deposition temperature. Because the adsorbed TMA molecules could not react with \u2013OH's to form smaller DMA groups at a low temperature, there were un-adsorbed \u2013OH's between TMA molecules due to the \u2013CH3 \u2013 \u2013CH3 repulsive interaction, as shown in Fig. 7(a). When the temperature increased to an intermediate level, so that the first TMA reacted with \u2013OH to form the UMA group via the DMA group, the secondarily adsorbed TMA right next to the UMA group could not react due to the high energy barrier of 1.01 eV, as shown in Fig. 7(b). At a high temperature, UMA groups were formed at inter-dimer sites through the whole surface, as shown in Fig. 7(c). Therefore, the surface chemistry during the first half-cycle of the ALD process can depend heavily on the surface temperature, and thereby an appropriate temperature should be determined for the initial Al2O3 thin-film growth using ALD.  We calculated energy barriers for the second TMA reaction, DMA group migration, and DMA group reaction with the adsorbed molecule or formed groups on a fully OH-terminated Si (0 0 1) surface using DFT. The phenomena of the whole reactions and migrations of the second molecules away from the first molecule/group were similar to the case of the first molecule. However, the second TMA reaction near the first molecule/group was less probable due to high energy barriers, which were in the range of 0.68\u20131.01 eV, due to the interaction of\u2013CH3 \u2013 \u2013CH3 and Al \u2013 \u2013CH3. Since high energy barriers were needed for the second TMA reaction, the surface chemistry during the first half-cycle of the ALD process could be mainly determined by the substrate surface temperature for the initial Al2O3 thin-film growth using ALD.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apenergy.2014.09.053.txt", "paper": ["In the last decade, solar photovoltaic (PV) has attracted significant attention worldwide due to its promising potential in addressing the world\u2019s energy needs. According to a recent report by the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA), the cumulative installed capacity of solar PV stood at 136.7 GW at the end of 2013 [1], with a world distribution as illustrated in Fig. 1 . More than half of the installations contributing to the cumulative total were carried out in Europe, amounting close to 80 GW. A staggering 37 GW of new solar PV capacity was installed in 2013 \u2013 an increase of 35% when compared with the installations carried out in 2012 [1]. The leading market of new solar PV installations has shifted from Europe to Asia in the last year, with China and Japan as the top 2 countries that contributed to this new installed capacity with 11 GW and 7 GW respectively [1]. The rising number of solar PV installations in many countries has been mainly driven by the introduction of the feed-in tariff scheme [2\u201311]. It is reported that solar PV will continue its strong growth in 2014, with a projection of global expenditure on solar PV expected to increase by 45% in 2014 \u2013 reaching approximately $3.8 billion [12]. The solar PV market is dominated by crystalline silicon technology at 90% of the total share, with the remaining 10% contributed by thin film technology [13]. Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) is another technology that is employed to capture solar energy. The main aim of this technology is to reduce the cost of solar PV systems by minimising the usage of expensive PV material in the system design. This is achieved by incorporating an optical device that concentrates the sunlight onto a smaller area where a PV cell is attached [14]. By 2014 CPV contributes only with 357.9 MW to the total installed capacity \u2013 led by China and America [15]. However, according to GlobalData, the CPV market will \u2018expand dramatically\u2019 in the next few years, and is projected to reach 1GW in 2020 [15]. These installations are normally carried out in large solar power plant, but recently there has been a significant rise in the use of CPV for building integration applications including sky lights, double glazing windows and solar blinds [16\u201318]. This concept is widely known as building integrated concentrating photovoltaic (BICPV). Researchers have produced various types of concentrators for CPV purposes [16,19\u201330]. One of the most popular designs is known as the compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) and has been explored for various applications since 1960s [31]. The basic geometry of a CPC is shown in Fig. 2 . It can be divided into three parts; a planar entrance aperture (AB), two totally internally reflecting or reflective side profiles which consist of segments of parabolas (AC and BD) and an exit aperture (CD). The CPC has a half-acceptance angle 1 of \u03b8a and concentrates all the incoming sun rays within its half-acceptance angle to the exit aperture CD [31]. To date, there are varieties of CPCs that have been studied (see Table 1 ). The two most common designs of CPC are the 2D linear [33] and the 3D rotational symmetry [34]. The 2D design is produced by extruding the cross section of a symmetrical CPC along the axis perpendicular to the 2D cross section \u2013 creating a square or rectangular exit aperture. As for the 3D rotational symmetry design, the 2D cross section design is rotated around the optical axis of the CPC which will have circular entrance and exit apertures. These concentrators can be fabricated from reflective materials such as mirrors or from solid dielectric materials. According to Welford and Winston [31], a concentrator fabricated using a solid dielectric material offers additional practical advantages such as ensuring 100% efficient total internal reflection on the side wall, producing a wider half-acceptance angle as well as creating a more compact concentrator. Benitez et al. [35] indicates that the performance of any concentrator can be evaluated by using the concentration-acceptance product (CAP) formulae, which are defined as follow: For the 2D design [35], the CAP is defined as CAP2D=Cg(2D)sin(\u03b8a) while for the 3D design [35], it is defined as CAP3D=\u221aCg(3D)sin(\u03b8a) where Cg is the geometrical concentration gain 2 and \u03b8a is the half-acceptance angle of the concentrator. The CAP value is governed by the thermodynamic upper bound limit of equal to the value of the refractive index of the material, n. In theory, a concentrator with a higher CAP value performs better than a concentrator having a lower CAP value. It is therefore desirable to have a design that has a CAP value closer to the value of index of refraction. Ronnelid et al. [36] investigated the performance of a 2D extrusion of a symmetrical CPC fabricated from a reflective aluminium foil. The CPC has a geometrical concentration gain of 1.53, an exit aperture width of 14.4 cm, a total height of 12 cm and a half-acceptance angle of 35\u00b0. From the simulations, it was found that the CPC-collector could increase the annual energy output by 2.6% when compared with the non-concentrating system. This concentrator has a CAP of 0.88. Pei et al. [37] on the other hand, studied the performance of a 2D extrusion of a symmetrical dielectric CPC. The CPC has a geometrical concentration gain of 2.41, an exit aperture width of 1 cm, a total height of 2.7 cm and a half-acceptance angle of 36.8\u00b0. It is calculated that the CAP of the concentrator is 1.44. Based on their experiments, they concluded that the introduction of a dielectric CPC increased the electrical power from 25.86 mW to 44.80 mW when compared with non-concentrating PV, an increment of about 73%. Cooper et al. [38] utilised a reflective 3D rotationally symmetric CPC that has a half-acceptance angle of 30\u00b0. From their ray tracing analysis, they found that the transmission-angle curve of the reflective design produced an almost ideal step-like behaviour within its designed acceptance angle. Goodman et al. [39]. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "analysed the performance of a 3D rotationally symmetric dielectric CPC with a geometrical concentration gain of 6.1, a half-acceptance angle of 10\u00b0. The CAP is calculated to be 0.43. From the experiment, the cell coupled with this CPC design produced a 5.7 more short circuit current when compared with a bare solar cell. Mallick et al. [40] also demonstrated another variation of a CPC design known as the asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (ACPC). Unlike the symmetrical 2D CPC, the two segments of the ACPC consist of two different lengths of parabola which allows the final design to have a wider acceptance angle. The concentrator has a geometrical concentration gain of 2 and is fabricated from a reflective material. Based on the experiments, their results point out that this concentrator managed to increase the maximum electrical output power by 62% when compared with a non-concentrating system \u2013 achieving a maximum optical efficiency 3 of 85.85%. Sarmah et al. [40] researched on a dielectric ACPC having a geometrical concentration gain of 2.8. Their analysis showed that the design has a maximum optical efficiency of 80.5% and increased the electrical power ratio to 2.27 when compared with a system without a concentrator. Mammo et al. [42] constructed a reflective 3D crossed compound parabolic concentrator (CCPC)-based photovoltaic module. A CCPC is formed by intersecting two extrusions of linear symmetrical CPC orthogonally. With a geometrical concentration gain of 3.61, a half-acceptance angle of 30\u00b0, a total height of 1.616 cm and a square 1 cm by 1 cm exit aperture, this design is capable of generating a maximum electrical power concentration of 3 when compared to similar type of non-concentrating module. This concentrator has a CAP of 0.95. Baig et al. [43] fabricated the previous concentrator design by using a dielectric material known as polyurethane having a refractive index of 1.5, and evaluated its performance. The dielectric CCPC design has a maximum optical efficiency of 73.4%, a half-acceptance angle of 35\u00b0 and produced a maximum electrical power ratio of 2.67 when compared with the non-concentrating design. As for the CAP, the value is calculated to be 1.09. This paper proposes a new type of CPC design for use in BIPV systems. This concentrator is known as a rotationally asymmetrical compound parabolic concentrator (RACPC). Section 2 explains the steps involved in producing this design, and the geometrical properties of the RACPC are presented in Section 3. The optical concentration gain analysis is carried out in Section 4 to evaluate the angular performance of the concentrator. Afterwards, the annual output prediction of an RACPC based panel is presented in Section 5. Conclusions are presented at the end of the paper.  The RACPC is a new variation of the CPC and can be constructed from dielectric material. The foundation and the algorithms to produce this concentrator are based on the concentrator design proposed by Ning et al. [28] for the dielectric totally internally reflecting concentrator (DTIRC). According to Ning et al. [28], the CPC is a specific case of the DTIRC family with a flat entrance aperture. A MATLAB\u00ae based program has been developed to create the RACPC. The flow chart of the program is summarised in Fig. 3 while the illustration of the creation process is presented in Fig. 4 . The RACPC design requires of the following input parameters: the total height of the concentrator, (HTot), the half-acceptance angle (\u03b8a), the length of the PV cell (LPV), the width of the PV cell (WPV), the trial width of the entrance aperture (d 1), the index of refraction of the material (n) and the number of extreme rays (N). First, based on the input parameters, a 2D symmetrical design is produced (see position \u20181\u2019 in Fig. 4). The computer program calculates the trial height, which is later used to calculate the coordinates of the side wall of the parabola. This calculation takes into account a number of extreme rays entering the concentrator at the critical angle. Once it is completed, the program compares the trial entrance aperture to the calculated entrance aperture. The difference between the two apertures is used to adjust the trial entrance aperture. A number of iterations take place until the difference between both entrance apertures is within an acceptable error value. The calculated total height of the concentrator is then compared with the desired total height and is adjusted by varying the half-acceptance angle until the difference between the two total heights is within an acceptable error value. These steps will define the 2D design in position \u20181\u2019. The process is repeated to get the next 2D cross-section design (see position \u20182\u2019 in Fig. 4). Each new design is computed by incrementing the angle of rotation of the cross-sections by 1\u00b0 and using the predetermined exit aperture value. The process stops when a 180\u00b0 rotation around the y-axis is completed. The program calculates three output parameters; the \u2018final\u2019 half-acceptance angle, the \u2018final\u2019 width of entrance aperture and the geometrical concentration gain of the concentrator. The program also saves all the coordinates of the design in a point cloud format for fabrication purposes. The RACPC shown in Fig. 5 is generated by selecting the total height HTot of 3.0 cm, a refractive index n of 1.5 and the exit aperture with dimensions of 1 cm by 1 cm. The geometry of the concentrator has distinctive features when compared with other CPCs. First, the planar entrance aperture has four axis of symmetry (see Fig. 5(b)), unlike the 3D rotationally symmetry CPC or the CCPC which has a circular and square shape respectively. Another important feature of this concentrator is its square exit aperture, as presented in Fig. 5(c). Sellami et al. [16] argued that the circular entrance and exit apertures of a traditional rotationally symmetry CPC exhibit losses which reduce the optical efficiency of the concentrator. They also indicated that from a manufacturing point of view, it is more desirable and easier to fabricate a square or a rectangular cell, which is a widely. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "available shape in the market, than a circular cell required in a rotationally symmetry design [16]. The RACPC is also a variation of a 3D design, therefore it provides a higher geometrical concentration gain than the 2D linear CPC design of a symmetrical CPC.  This section investigates the effect of varying the total height and the refractive index of the concentrator on both the geometrical concentration gain and the half-acceptance angle of the RACPC. The geometrical concentration gain, Cg of a 3D concentrator is defined as the area ratio of the entrance aperture to the exit aperture of the concentrator [31]. It has been indicated in Section 2 that the MATLAB\u00ae program requires certain input parameters and returns three main output parameters which are the geometrical gain, the \u2018final\u2019 half-acceptance angle and the \u2018final\u2019 length of the entrance aperture. This information is valuable in estimating the final optoelectronic gain based on the input parameters as well as constructing and assembling the optimum RACPC design for BICPV applications. Fig. 6 shows some of the properties of RACPCs generated with various total heights and different refractive indices, where the variation of geometrical concentration gain and the half-acceptance angle are presented in Figs. 6(a) and (b) respectively. From Fig. 6(a), it can be observed that the geometrical concentration gain varies between 1.7299 and 6.5920. In general, the geometrical concentration gain increases as the total height of the concentrator increases. In Fig. 6(b), the half-acceptance angle of the RACPC varies from 25.9183\u00b0 to 55.3914\u00b0. From these observations, it can be concluded that when the height of the concentrator (and the gain) increases, the half-acceptance angle reduces. In terms of index of refraction, it can also be seen that both the geometrical concentration gain and the half-acceptance angle increase when the index of refraction of the material increases, as illustrated in Fig. 6. For two concentrators with the same height, the one fabricated with a higher index of refraction has a higher geometrical concentration gain and larger half-acceptance angle. These three behaviours support the findings by Ning et al. [28] and Muhammad-Sukki et al. [19,22,25].  Another important aspect to investigate is the optical concentration gain. The optical concentration gain, Copt is defined as [16,31]: Copt=\u03b2exit\u03b2entrance\u00d7Cg where \u03b2exit, \u03b2entrance and Cg are the flux (in W) at the exit aperture, the flux (in W) at the entrance aperture and the geometrical concentration gain respectively. The ratio of the flux at the entrance aperture to the flux at the exit aperture is also known as the optical efficiency, Copt-eff of a concentrator [34,41]. In theory, any rays within the acceptance angle of the concentrator will emerge at the exit aperture of the concentrator [31]. The analysis evaluates the gain performance of the concentrator when exposed to rays at different angles of incidence. This is useful to predict the theoretical performance of the RACPC when exposed to the sun. First, the 3-D surface coordinates of an RACPC are generated from MATLAB\u00ae in a point cloud format. This file is then imported into GeoMagic\u00ae software to produce a computer-aided design (CAD) model from which an Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format file model is obtained, such as the one illustrated in Fig. 5. Subsequently, this IGES file is imported into an optical system design software called ZEMAX\u00ae to conduct the ray tracing analysis. A simulation using any optical system design software such as ZEMAX\u00ae is better than using a programming software (i.e. MATLAB\u00ae) because [44]: (i) it gives flexibility in analysing any optical devices; (ii) it can analyse a greater number of incoming rays which results in better resolution of the optical flux distribution; (iii) it shortens the simulation times significantly, and (iv) it provides better result representations at the end of the simulation. The setup for the ray tracing analysis in ZEMAX\u00ae is shown in Fig. 7 . A square light source is selected to produce one million collimated rays and is configured to produce an incoming power of 1000 W. The IGES file of the RACPC is placed at a distance of 35 cm from the light source. To calculate the number of rays at the entrance and exit aperture of the RACPC, two photo detectors are attached at both ends of the concentrator. The simulation is carried out by first, firing the rays perpendicular to the concentrator where the number of rays at the entrance and exit apertures are calculated and recorded. This is repeated by increasing the rays\u2019 incidence angle by 5\u00b0 until a maximum angle of 60\u00b0 is reached. Fig. 8 shows the optical concentration gain variation of several RACPC designs when the total height is varied from 2 cm to 5 cm and the refractive index is varied from 1.30 to 1.50. From the simulations, it is observed that the concentrator provides a substantial gain within its half-acceptance angle (in this example it can reach up to 6.18), and the optical concentration gain reduces when the angle of incidence is beyond the half-acceptance angle. A comparison between the half-acceptance angle values generated from the ZEMAX\u00ae simulation and the one generated from the MATLAB\u00ae simulations is presented in Table 2 . Interestingly, the value of the half-acceptance angle obtained from the ZEMAX\u00ae simulations agrees with calculated half-acceptance angle from the MATLAB\u00ae simulation with a small percentage variation of between \u22120.32% and 7.62%. The CAP value is also calculated and included in Table 2. The CAP value is always less than the index of refraction and ranges between 0.88 and 1.32. It can be concluded that the trend of optical concentration gain is similar to the geometrical concentration gain analysis, where the optical concentration gain increases when the total height of the concentrator increases. This is also true in terms of the refractive index of the concentrator material, where the optical concentration gain is higher when the refractive index of the concentrator is higher for the same total height. It is therefore pertinent to know that some trade off needs to be made. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "when choosing the optimum RACPC design for the BICPV system. A higher gain is often desirable but this translates into a taller concentrator and smaller acceptance angle \u2013 this means that the RACPC design will only gather sun light for a shorter period of time during the day. It is also important to investigate the variation of irradiance distribution on the solar cell when incorporating different RACPC designs. It has been reported by various researchers that an increase in concentration for a long period of time increases the temperature of the solar cell, and eventually reduces the electrical output of the system [25,42\u201344]. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of irradiance on the solar cell when three different RACPC designs having the same refractive index of 1.40 are simulated at normal angle of incidence. Based on the conditions indicated earlier in Section 4, a typical solar cell has a maximum peak irradiance of 16.7 W/cm2, as illustrated in Fig. 9(a). As for the RACPC, the irradiance distribution is concentrated at the four corners of the solar cell. The maximum peak irradiance reaches up to 70 W/cm2, 90 W/cm2 and 140 W/cm2 when the total height of the RACPC increases to 3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm respectively. This translates into an increment of 4\u00d7, 5\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 respectively when compared with the peak irradiance on a non-concentrating cell. It is therefore crucial for a BICPV system to have the right RACPC design and cooling system to ensure that the performance of the solar cell is at its optimum. If an RACPC design with higher gain is needed, the solar cell could be cooled by introducing a hybrid/thermal system (either using air or water), that utilises the co-generated heat to produce hot water and stimulate ventilation [19,25,45].  It is desirable to predict the annual electrical output (in kW h) generated from the CPV system utilising the RACPC design and compare it with a conventional non-concentrating PV skylight. The comparison is carried out based on the area (in square meter) of solar cell used to produce a 1 m2 PV skylight. One particular design of RACPC is chosen, with a total height of 3 cm and fabricated from a material with a refractive index of 1.5. Fig. 10 shows an example of the CPV design that incorporates the chosen RACPC concentrator. To simplify the analysis, the following assumptions are made: (i) the solar cell conversion efficiency is 17.32% 4 ; (ii) the panels are installed near the Malaysian Meteorological Department in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia (5\u00b022\u203248\u2033N, 103\u00b000\u203200\u2033E); (iii) the panels are mounted on a south facing rooftop at an angle of 5\u00b0 from the horizontal to match the latitude of the site [46], and (iv) the panels are static, i.e. no mechanical tracking system is attached on any panel. Based on the average daily solar irradiance data in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia [47], the variation of sun path throughout the year [46] and the daily optical concentration gain from the ZEMAX\u00ae simulation, the energy yield from both panels are calculated. Fig. 11 shows the annual energy output from the RACPC panel and the conventional PV skylight. The RACPC panel produces 220 kW h per year, in contrast to the traditional PV skylight which only generates about 67.75 kW h per year. It can be seen that the RACPC based panel could increase the electrical output by 3.25 times (225%) when compared with amount generated by the non-concentrating counterpart. It is important to mention here that these calculations only predict the annual electricity output generated by the two panels. Another advantage of the concentrator is that it could provide natural ambient light for building interiors due to the fact that the material used for the concentrator is transparent, which could potentially reduce the energy consumption and electricity cost for lighting purposes. Also, the cogenerated heat from the cooling system of the cell could be used for heating and/or to stimulate ventilation, which also reduces the electricity requirements in a building.  A new type of concentrator, known as the RACPC has been created for use in BICPV systems. The steps to produce the RACPC have been discussed and both the geometrical concentration gain and the optical concentration gain are evaluated. From the simulations, it has been found that the RACPC could produce an optical concentration gain as high as 6.18 when compared with the non-concentrating cell depending on the half-acceptance angle. It can be concluded that a BICPV system incorporating this RACPC would not only generate electricity efficiently, but also minimise energy consumption in buildings by providing ambient light to building interiors, and using the cogenerated heat for heating and stimulating ventilation which could provide greener and sustainable building.

Surface structuring, typically called texturing, is thus necessary for Si to be used for solar cells. It is well known that (1 0 0)-oriented single-crystalline Si wafer can be textured into randomly distributed pyramids by alkali etchants such as KOH or NaOH . The pyramid structure induced by anisotropic etching reflects the incident light twice before escaping from the textured surface, reducing the total reflectivity to less than 20%. Since poly-Si has multi-orientations, it is impossible to uniformly control its surface structure by anisotropic alkali etching. Acid etching is generally used to reduce the surface reflectance of poly-Si solar cells. A HF/HNO3 solution, which tends to isotropically etch, can result in features owing to the inhomogeneity of etching speed. As opposed to flat-sided features obtained by anisotropic etching, the acid-etched wafer exhibits rounded surfaces. Although acid etching helps suppress the surface reflectivity to some degree, the obtained irregular structures are less effective than the pyramid structures. Therefore, a great deal of research effort has been carried out to reduce the surface reflectivity of poly-Si. The so-called \u201cblack silicons\u201d with very low reflectances have already been developed by many different methods . Nevertheless, they are still not utilized for solar cells because of high recombination rates resulting from the significantly increased surface area. Low surface reflectivity is required for high-efficiency solar cells but it does not guarantee high performance. While it needs to trap more light, the increase in total surface area should be minimized at the same time. Non-chemical methods like mechanical grooving and reactive-ion etching have also been investigated for texturing poly-Si. However, they are complicated processes requiring expensive systems and may cause degradation in the electrical characteristics . In the meanwhile, honeycomb textures are known to give very high efficiencies when applied to poly-Si solar cells . While the honeycomb structures have been generally fabricated by photolithography, interference lithography can be used to produce a variety of one, two, and three-dimensional periodic structures . Three-beam lithography has been employed to create the desired photoresist pattern in order to etch the Si substrate . A similar laser-based technique has also been suggested, where a laser-patterned layer is used as the etching mask for the underlying Si wafer. Although the hard mask film is directly patterned by laser ablation, this technique also needs multiple steps including thin film deposition and etching. In this paper, we show that regular honeycomb structures can be fabricated on poly-Si wafer by irradiation with interfering laser beams and subsequent acid etching. Unlike the previous approaches, this method does not require any mask, which greatly simplifies the fabrication process.  Poly-Si wafers (p-type, resistivity = 1\u201330 \u03a9 cm, thickness = 200 \u03bcm) were supplied from LG SILTRON. The saw damage was removed by dipping the wafer into a 20% KOH solution at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min. Then, the wafer was cleaned by acetone, ethanol, deionized (DI) water and dried using N2 gas. A pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Model: Brilliant b, Quantel, wavelength = 532 nm, pulse width = 5 ns, repetition rate = 10 Hz, maximum pulse energy = 350 mJ, beam diameter = 0.9 cm) was employed as the laser source. The output laser beam had already a hat-top profile and thus a beam homogenizer was not used. An output beam was transmitted through a trigonal pyramid-shaped prism made of quartz (n = 1.52) and the three refracted beams were made to interfere on the wafer. The used pulse energy was 70\u2013100 mJ and the irradiation time was less than 1 s. Acid etching was performed at 35 \u00b0C using a HF/HNO3 solution (HF:HNO3:DI water = 1:2:2 in volume). Alkali etching was carried out using a 20% KOH aqueous solution at 80 \u00b0C. The surface morphology was investigated by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7001F, 15 kV). The crystalline quality of Si was analyzed by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2100F) and a focused ion beam apparatus (FEI NOVA600) was used for the sample preparation. The surface reflectance was measured using a spectrophotometer with an integration sphere (Agilent Cary 670) in the range of 200\u20131100 nm.  Our approach is fundamentally based on the laser-driven melting of material. We have found that Si can be melted by irradiation with a nanosecond-pulsed laser at 532 nm. When the wafer was exposed to three interfering laser beams, the surface was locally melted in accordance with the interference pattern of two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry. As a result, concave holes were periodically generated on the surface because the melted material overflowed and condensed at the periphery. This phenomenon was employed to make a regular texture structure on the surface of Si wafer. Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the fabrication process. The Si wafer is first irradiated by three interfering laser beams which are generated by transmitting an output laser beam through a refracting prism. A surface pattern consisting of concave holes is then formed on the surface. The melt-condensed material could be quickly dissolved by an acid solution (within 10 s by a HF/HNO3 solution). Since the surface orientations within the hole are position-dependent, the inner wall will be etched at different rates by an alkali solution, resulting in polyhedron-shaped morphology. In contrast, isotropic acid etching will make the original holes deeper and wider and ultimately give rise to a honeycomb structure. Fig. 2(a) shows the surface of as-irradiated poly-Si wafer. When the wafer was subsequently etched by a KOH solution, the inner morphology of the holes was changed into a polyhedron shape, which varied depending on the crystal orientation (Fig. 2(b)). An inverted-pyramid texture was obtained on the (1 0 0)-oriented grain (inset of Fig. 2(b)). When the sample was acid-etched, a honeycomb texture was formed all over the irradiated area, regardless of the grain orientation (Fig. 2(c)). Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that no irradiation-induced defects remained after etching (Fig. 3 ). The inset of Fig. 3(b) is an electron diffraction pattern taken near the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "top surface, which confirms high crystalline-quality. Apart from the fabrication cost and time, this method has an additional advantage over lithographic processes. The reflectivity of honeycomb structure can be much affected by the hole depth-to-width ratio. In conventional lithography, the independent control of depth and width is a challenge because etching starts from the flat surface and even the masked areas will be undercut due to the isotropic nature of acid etching. On the contrary, the depth of holes could be controlled by varying the laser pulse energy and irradiation time in this method. Fig. 4 shows the reflection spectra. As the minimum area required for reflectance measurement was 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm, the wafer was patterned over large area (2.0 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm) using a translation stage. When the refracted beams were made to overlap on the Si surface, three-beam interference took place within a hexagon area with 3 mm side. Although two-beam overlapping regions also exist outside this hexagon area, no surface patterns were generated in the two-beam interference areas. This is important for the large-area fabrication of uniform textures. Otherwise, the surface patterns induced by two-beam and three-beam interference would be mixed. For reflectance measurement, a Si wafer was stationed on the translation stage and irradiated in a spot-by-spot fashion while the laser and prism were fixed at positions. The surface reflectivity decreased as the depth of honeycombs increased. An average reflectance of 10% could be obtained in a honeycomb structure consisting of holes with 5.0 \u03bcm width and 7.5 \u03bcm depth. As the holes get deeper, the surface area also increases. Therefore, the optimum structure for solar cells should be determined through a feedback process from the device fabrication and characterization. In the current experiments, the wafer was irradiated for 0.5\u20131 s (i.e., with 5\u201310 pulses) at pulse energy of 70\u2013100 mJ. Since the three-beam interference area is about 20 mm2, the patterning speed is 20\u201340 mm2/s if we neglect the time taken to move the stage. The used laser has a repetition rate of 10 Hz with maximum pulse energy of 350 mJ (3.5 W). Nevertheless, much lower pulse energies than the maximum available energy were employed because the surface was excessively melted even with a single pulse at 350 mJ. This implies that the interference area could have been much enlarged if a beam expander and a larger prism were used. Surface patterning by a single pulse might also be possible with fine tuning of the beam size and pulse energy. Single pulse-patterning is highly preferable with respect to the process speed and scalability because the stage can be moved for 0.1 s between successive pulses without blocking the beam. This remains as a future work.  In conclusion, we here show that honeycomb textures can be fabricated on poly-Si wafer without using a pre-patterned mask. When the wafer was irradiated by three interfering pulsed laser beams at 532 nm, concave holes were periodically generated on the surface as a result of the laser-induced melting of material. Isotropic etching with a HF/HNO3 solution resulted in uniform honeycomb textures. The depth of honeycombs could be controlled by varying the pulse energy and irradiation time. A minimum reflectance of 10% was obtained. The experimental results presented here provide a facile route to fabricate regular surface structures for low-reflectance and may be effectively utilized for high-efficiency poly-Si solar cells.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The noble metal materials as SERS substrates have been widely reported, such as Au [6], Ag [7], but due to the high cost, their application in SERS field was gradually limited. In recent years, the researchers found that some semiconductor materials as SERS substrates can effectively enhance the Raman signals [5,8]. The Lombardi's group have been working most intensively and systematically on this topic over about two decades, on both bulk and nano-semiconductors, such as ZnO [9], MoS2 [10], CdSe [11], CdTe [12] and TiO2 [13]. As a typical semiconductor material, TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) have received a lot of research interest for their good biocompatibility, chemical stability, excellent photoactivity [14]. Recently the SERS performance of TiO2 NPs as noble metal-free SERS substrate also attracted people\u2019s attention. For instance, Yang et al. [15] prepared the highly-dispersed TiO2 NPs with plentiful active sites as a SERS substrate, the detection limit of 4-aminobenzoic acid is 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\u202fM. In fact, the TiO2 NPs possess large band gap, which result in the limited light harvesting and the lower SERS sensitivity, further limit the application of TiO2 NPs as SERS substrate. Therefore, tremendous works have been done to narrow the band gap of TiO2 NPs. In general, the band gap can be narrowed by doping with nonmetal elements [16], sensitizing by narrow-band gap semiconductor quantum dots [17] or the inverse opals structure (IOS) [18]. As far as we know, the IOS can narrow the band gap of semiconductor material, which resulted from the multiple scattering effect and slow photon effect [18]. Besides, due to the enhanced light absorption and the interaction between the light and mater, the semiconductor material with IOS can also improve the SERS sensitivity and photoelectric converting performance. Our group [19] prepared the N-CDs/Bi2O3 IOS with enhanced photoelectrochemical performance and photocatalytic activity via sol-gel method, which demonstrated that the IOS can narrow the band gap of Bi2O3 from 2.7\u202feV to 2.4\u202feV. Ankudze et al. [20] prepared the Au-loaded SiO2 IOS by infiltrating as high active SERS substrate, the detection limit of 4-aminothiophenol is 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221210\u202fM. So the nanomaterials with IOS can be expected to apply in SERS detection and photoelectrochemical field as bifunctional materials. Furthermore, some narrow-band gap semiconductor quantum dots can also narrowed the band gap by sensitizing, such as CdSe [21], CdS [22] and so on. Among them, as the most attractive narrow-band gap sensitizer, the CdSe possesses excellent optical property. The CdSe sensitization can extend the absorption band of semiconductor materials to the visible light-near infrared region and effectively enhance the light absorption [23]. Qin et al. [24] prepared CdSe/TiO2 nanotube array by electrochemical electrodeposition, the photocurrent density is 138\u202f\u03bcA/cm2. As we know, the plasma resonance bands of the semiconductor material locate in the near infrared region, so when the light absorption is occurred in the near infrared region, the SERS signal intensity will become strong [25]. Therefore, the sensitization by CdSe can effectively enhance the sensitivity of TiO2 with IOS as SERS substrate. However there is still no report about the combination of CdSe sensitization and IOS on TiO2 as SERS substrate applying in contaminants detecting field. Considering the above-mentioned advantages of the IOS and CdSe sensitization, here, we synthesized the ordered three-dimensional CdSe-TiO2 IOS film. We found that the unique inverse opal structure benefits the electron transportation and light absorption, which further enhanced the sensitivity and photoelectrochemical property of the SERS substrate. Moreover, the CdSe sensitization can effectively extend the absorption band to the visible light-near infrared region, which enhanced the sensitivity of the CdSe-TiO2 IOS SERS substrate for MB detection and improved photoelectric converting performance as well as photocurrent density. The prepared CdSe-TiO2 IOS as multifunctional SERS substrate exhibits the potential application in environmental detection and solar cells, etc.  Styrene (St), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, K-30), diethanolamine (C4H11NO2), potassium persulfate (KPS), ethanol (C2H6O), cadmium chloride (CdCl2\u00b72H2O), sodium sulfide (Na2S\u00b79H2O), selenium powders (Se), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and methylene blue(MB) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (P. R. China). Titanium isopropoxide (TIPT) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company (P. R. China). Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (P. R. China). Deionized water is obtained from Millipore Milli-Q system (resistivity: 18.2\u202fM\u03a9\u00b7cm). Firstly, we prepared PS spheres by a adapted surfactant-free emulsion polymerization reaction according to our previous work [19]. 12.1\u202fg of St and 0.6\u202fg of PVP were mixed with 100\u202fmL of deionized water in round-bottomed flask in a water bath, the mixture was stirred for 15\u202fmin at room temperature. Then 20\u202fmL of KPS solution (The solvent is ethanol) was added to the above mixture dropwise, and the flask was replenished with N2 for 20\u202fmin to remove O2. The temperature of mixture was increased to 70\u202f\u00b0C and kept for 24\u202fh with stirring. After natural cooling down to room temperature, the precipitate was separated and then washed by ethanol and deionized water for three times. Thus, PS spheres were obtained. PS opal was fabricated by the vertical deposition method, using an aqueous monodispersed PS sphere colloidal suspension at 0.1\u202fvol% and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass substrates. FTO conductive glass was cleaned by immersing in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 10\u202fmin with sonication, and dried under a N2 stream. Then the prepared monodispersed PS spheres were assembled onto the FTO-coated glass substrates via a vertical deposition process at 45\u202f\u00b0C. After the thin films were developed, they were heated to 70\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh to enhance the connection between these neighboring PS spheres, which improves the structural stability of the film [26]. 5.2\u202fmL of TIPT was added to a solution containing 35\u202fmL of ethanol and 1.1\u202fmL of diethanolamine under vigorous stirring and kept stirring at room temperature for 24\u202fh. Then the TiO2 collosol was obtained by ageing of the mixture for 1\u20132\u202fdays. The PS opal film was dipped in the TiO2 collosol for 30\u202fmin, then dried for. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "1\u202fh in air. Finally, the composite film was sintered in a muffle furnace at 500\u202f\u00b0C (ramping rate of 1\u202f\u00b0C/min) in air for 3\u202fh to remove the polymer template for obtaining TiO2 IOS film. The prepared TiO2 IOS film was immersed into a CdCl2 solution (50\u202fmM) for 5\u202fmin in order to the absorption of Cd2+ on the thin film. Then the film was immersed into a Se2\u2212 solution (50\u202fmM) for 5\u202fmin. Thus the CdSe particles were formed on the TiO2 IOS framework. Finally the above films were washed by deionized water to remove the excess ions, and dried with N2. Thus, CdSe-TiO2 IOS was obtained. The TiO2 NPs were prepared by calcinations of the above obtained TiO2 collosol. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a DX-2700 (Dandong Haoyuan instrument Co., Ltd.,) using Cu-K\u03b1 (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.5406\u202fA\u00b0) radiation, the accelerating voltage was 35\u202fkV and applied current was 25\u202fmA. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were taken with a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope. Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were measured on an INCA x-act energy dispersive spectrometer with a voltage of 15\u202fkV (Oxford Instruments). Raman spectra were obtained on a focusing Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia) with a 532\u202fnm laser excitation. UV\u2013Vis spectra were measured using a UV-4100 model UV\u2013Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The photoelectrochemical performance measurements were conducted in three electrode configuration, the as-prepared nanostructured photoanodes were deposited on the FTO as working electrodes [27], the Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl solution was used as a reference electrode, Pt foil was used as the counter electrode. The mixed solution of Na2S (0.24\u202fmol/L) and Na2SO3 (0.35\u202fmol/L) was used as the electrolyte. The photocurrent versus time tests were carried out in electrochemical workstation at room temperature, and the photoresponse was measured under chopped light illumination (350\u202fW Xe lamp equipped with a filter, light/dark cycles of 20\u202fs) at a fixed bias of 0\u202fV versus Ag/AgCl.  The prepared opal template composed of the PS spheres with the diameter of 260\u202fnm is presented in Fig. 1 a and b. It is clearly seen that the PS opal template exhibits a dense face-centered cubic (fcc) arrangement of monodispersed spheres with the (1\u202f1\u202f1) plane oriented parallel to the underlying FTO substrate. SEM images of TiO2 IOS are shown in Fig. 1c and d, we can see that the 3D macroporous ordered TiO2 IOS has been successfully synthesized, its pore size is about 220\u202fnm, less than the diameter of the PS spheres due to sol shrinkage and polymer collapse during calcination [28]. But the ordered three-dimensional macroporous structure is well maintained, speculating that the slow photon and multi-scattering effect of the unique structure can improve the SERS signal of substrate and photoelectric conversion performance. The CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite films were obtained by the CdSe growth in situ resulted from the interaction of Cd2+ with Se2\u2212 on TiO2 IOS skeletons. Its morphology is shown in Fig. 1e and f, compared with pure TiO2 IOS, the skeleton thickness of CdSe-TiO2 IOS is obviously increased. And it can be seen that the surface of the skeleton is no longer smooth, suggesting that we have fabricated a three-dimensional macroporous CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film. Fig. 2 a presents the XRD patterns of TiO2 IOS and CdSe-TiO2 IOS. The peaks at 2\u202f\u03b8\u202fof 25.3\u00b0, 38\u00b0, 47.7\u00b0 and 54.8\u00b0 could be indexed to the crystal planes of anatase phase (JCPDS card, No. 65\u20135714) after annealing. We also found that some new small diffraction peaks (indicated by \u201c\u2666\u201d) in the XRD pattern of CdSe-TiO2 IOS were observed at 2\u202f\u03b8\u202fof 29.5\u00b0, 42.2\u00b0 and 77.2\u00b0 corresponding to the crystal face of (2\u202f0\u202f0), (2\u202f2\u202f0) and (4\u202f2\u202f2) of CdSe (JCPDS card, No.065-2891), respectively, indicating that CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film was obtained by sensitizing TiO2 IOS with CdSe. Furthermore, the average size of CdSe particles estimated from the XRD data via the well-known Scherrer equation [29] is 5.98\u202fnm, showing the obtained CdSe particles are nano-sized. The EDS analysis of the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 IOS is shown in Fig. 2b. We can see that the existence of Ti, O, Cd and Se elements, it further confirms that we have successfully prepared the CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film. From Fig. 3 a, we can see that TiO2 NPs, TiO2 IOS and CdSe-TiO2 IOS all present optical response behavior. Compared with them, it is found that TiO2 NPs has only UV absorption, while the light absorption of TiO2 IOS film has an obvious red shift because of the multiple scattering effect and slow photon effect resulting from inverse opal structure. Apparently, after the CdSe sensitization, the light absorption range of CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film is much larger than that of TiO2 IOS film, which is broadened into the visible light-near infrared region, indicating the CdSe-TiO2 IOS can take advantage of the sunlight adequately. In Fig. 3b, we can observe that the band gap of TiO2 NPs, TiO2 IOS and CdSe-TiO2 IOS are narrowed in turn, and the band gap of CdSe-TiO2 IOS is only 1.66\u202feV due to the effect of CdSe sensitization, showing strong light absorption in the visible light-near infrared region [28]. It is important to note that the obtained absorption edge of CdSe-TiO2 IOS is located at notably lower energy (\u223c750\u202fnm or 1.66\u202feV), which may result from the synergistic effect of strong plasmon resonance absorption of CdSe NPs [30] and unique TiO2 IOS in the near-infrared region [18]. The IOS can also narrow the band gap. The embedded CdSe in the pore wall of macroporous TiO2 IOS changed its electronic and optical properties. And this characteristic of CdSe-TiO2 IOS also improves the efficiency of separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes [17]. Therefore, it is expected that CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film may has higher SERS response and better photoelectrochemical property than TiO2 NPs and TiO2 IOS according to the previous reports [20,23]. The SERS detection results of MB (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126\u202fM) adsorbed TiO2 NPs, TiO2 IOS and CdSe-TiO2 IOS substrates are presented in Fig. 4 a. TiO2 NPs shows its own characteristic Raman peaks at 140\u202fcm\u22121, 393\u202fcm\u22121, 513\u202fcm\u22121 and 636\u202fcm\u22121, respectively, further indicating the presence of TiO2. The Raman. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "characteristic peaks of MB on CdSe-TiO2 IOS film at 1436\u202fcm\u22121 and 1622\u202fcm\u22121 are clearly seen, which can be assigned to stretching vibrations of C N and C C bonds on aromatic rings, respectively. We also can see two relatively strong peaks appearing at 206\u202fcm\u22121 and 448\u202fcm\u22121, which belong to the longitudinal optical (LO) and 2LO phonons of CdSe [31], respectively. Compared with the previous work [31], the 2LO phonon peak of CdSe in Fig. 4a has a 28\u202fcm\u22121 shift to high frequency because of the effect of absorbed MB molecules and the compressive strain from the TiO2 IOS [32]. By comparing to the Raman spectra of MB on the three substrates, we can observe that the Raman signals on CdSe-TiO2 IOS film is much higher than on TiO2 NPs and TiO2 IOS. The above results indicate the CdSe-TiO2 IOS film is a more suitable SERS substrate than TiO2 NPs and TiO2 IOS film for the detection of MB. The enhanced SERS sensitivity is not only attributed to the multiple scattering effect and slow photon effect resulted from the unique inverse opal structure, but also the extension of light absorption to visible light-near infrared region caused by CdSe sensitization. The SERS signal of MB with different concentrations on CdSe-TiO2 IOS substrate is shown in Fig. 4b. The peak relative intensities of the Raman signals at 1436\u202fcm\u22121 and 1622\u202fcm\u22121 decline as the MB concentration decreases gradually. But even at the concentration of 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129\u202fM, the characteristic peaks of MB on CdSe-TiO2 IOS film could be clearly found, indicating the CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film can detect the Raman signal of MB with the concentration of 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129\u202fM. Furthermore, the SERS enhancement factor (EF) was computed to 1.46\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 for 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129\u202fM MB on the CdSe-TiO2 IOS SERS substrate [18], which shows CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film possesses excellent SERS sensitivity for the detection of MB. From the results of Fig. 4b, we also can know that the CdSe-TiO2 IOS SERS signal (1622 and 1436\u202fcm\u22121) weakened with the decrease of concentration of MB, suggesting that the adsorbed molecules on the CdSe-TiO2 IOS surface also cause enhancement of Raman signal of semiconductors [11,33], or even cause changes of CdSe phonon spectra [31]. It is interesting to see the peak intensity of the CdSe 2LO phonon rose with the increase of concentration of MB, indicating that there is a correlation of the phonon peak change with the concentration of adsorbed molecules, which means the quantity of absorbed molecules have an important effect on the peak intensity of CdSe 2LO phonon [31]. The above influence behaviors between the absorbed molecules and substrate resulted from the electronic interactions, suggesting the existence of the chemical enhancement mechanism [34,35]. In addition, we clearly see the peak intensity of TiO2 phonon at 150\u202fcm\u22121 in Fig. 4a weakened after CdSe sensitization, which may result from the resonance behavior and the plasmon excitation energy transfer between the CdSe phonons and TiO2 phonons, indicating the presence of electromagnetic enhancement (EM) mechanism [36,37]. So the enhancement SERS mechanism of the prepared CdSe-TiO2 IOS contains not only chemical enhancement mechanism but also EM mechanism, which synergistically enhances the SERS sensitivity of CdSe-TiO2 IOS for detecting MB. The photocurrent versus time (I-t) curves of different samples during 400\u202fs measurement are showed in Fig. 5 . It exhibits good electrochemical stability in the hole scavenger electrolyte including Na2S and Na2SO3. The instantaneous photocurrent of original TiO2 NPs film is about 0.095\u202fmA/cm2. It is easy to observe that, because of the unique slow photons and multiple scattering effects, the instantaneous photocurrent of TiO2 IOS photoanode increases to 0.428\u202fmA/cm2, 4.5 times more than that of TiO2 NPs. The photocurrent density of CdSe-TiO2 IOS reaches to 0.924\u202fmA/cm2, which is 9.7 times than that of TiO2 NPs and 2.6 times than that of TiO2 IOS film, respectively, exhibiting the highest photoelectric conversion rate in the three photoanodes. Furthermore, the photocurrent response of the CdSe-TiO2 IOS photoanode has no obvious change after 10 on-off cycles. The above results indicate that both the ordered macroporous TiO2 inverse opal structure and CdSe sensitization benefit efficient light absorption and charge separation at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Higher photocurrent density shows that CdSe-TiO2 IOS SERS substrate with enhanced sensitivity can be applied in solar cells and other aspects as photoelectrochemical material.  In conclusion, the ordered three-dimensional CdSe-TiO2 IOS thin film was fabricated by using PS opal as the template and growing in situ of the CdSe. Due to the ordered three-dimensional inverse opal structure and sensitization, the absorption range of the composite film is broadened to the visible light-near infrared region. So CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film as the SERS substrate has a high sensitivity, and the detection limit of MB as probe molecules can reach 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129\u202fM. The photocurrent density of the CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film was found to be 0.924\u202fmA/cm2, much higher than that of TiO2 NPs and TiO2 IOS, indicating the CdSe-TiO2 IOS composite film possesses the best optical and photocatalytical properties. Moreover, the cost of CdSe-TiO2 IOS SERS substrate is much lower than that of precious metals. Therefore, the CdSe-TiO2 IOS with an ordered three-dimensional structure as a multifunctional SERS substrate could be applied in contaminant detection, solar cells and other aspects.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

This particular set of properties makes TCOs essential in the development of new technologies which require high-performance optoelectronic capabilities such as, but not limited to, ultra-high-resolution displays [1\u20133], light-emitting diodes [4,5], flexible electronics [2,4], and front-surface electrodes for solar cells [1,6].

While pure ZnO films exhibit low and unstable electrical conductivities, prior research has shown that the group III impurity doping (Ba [10,11], Al [12,13], Ga [11,14], In [11,15]) of ZnO allows for ZnO-based TCOs to achieve high electrical conductivities while maintaining their high levels of transparency. Among the many impurity-doped ZnO films, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) exhibits the lowest electrical resistivity of ~2\u20134\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202f\u03a9-cm at an Al2O3 content of 1\u20132\u202fwt% [12,16,17], identifying AZO as the outstanding impurity-doped ZnO-based TCO. Furthermore, AZO exhibits the capability to be fabricated at low temperature conditions (RT-200\u202f\u00b0C) [18,19], a necessary requirement when developing electronic devices on temperature-sensitive materials. Due to the unique combination of these promising characteristics, AZO is currently being investigated as a major TCO candidate in a variety of electronic applications such as thin film transistors (TFTs) [20,21], thin film solar cells [22,23], and organic electronic devices [5,24]. In device applications which fundamentally rely on charge transfer between the channel/active layer and electrode materials (such as solar cells), preferred interfacial contact characteristics are sought to be Ohmic and low in resistivity [25,26]. Ohmic contact at the heterojunction interface must be achieved as it ensures that undesirable charge obstruction is mitigated, allowing for sufficient charge transport between layers. However, inadequate contact between the two layers may occur due to the mismatching of electrode and active layer work function values [27,28] along with the formation of interfacial dipoles [27,29] and trap states [27,30]. In order to address the adverse effects of mismatched work functions, numerous techniques which focus on electrode work function tuning such as, but not limited to, self-assembled monolayer treatments [31] and chemical modification [32,33], have emerged as viable approaches for improving interfacial Ohmic contact characteristics. In recent years, several attempts have been made to effectively tune the work function values of AZO in order to expand its breadth of application [16,34]. In 2003, Jiang et al. discovered that the work function of AZO is dependent on the concentration of Al-dopant in the material, with a distinct variation in work function values from 3.7\u202feV to 4.4\u202feV at Al at. % ranging from 0.7 to 2.1, respectively [16]. However, altering wt% of Al-dopant material has a significant effect on the thermal stability and optoelectronic properties of AZO [12,16], thus limiting the viability of work function tuning through Al wt% variation. More recently, Feng et al. [35] and Wang et al. [34] further investigated AZO work function tuning through acetone solvent cleaning, during-deposition substrate-temperature variation (250\u2013350\u202f\u00b0C), and UV-ozone post-treatment exposure (as well as verifying the effects of Al-doping concentration). UV-ozone exposure was found to increase work function values by a maximum of ~0.4\u202feV at exposure times\u202f\u2265\u202f20\u202fmin [34,35], where substrate-temperature variation was shown to have no significant effect on AZO work function values in the observed temperature range [16]. Acetone solvent cleaning of the AZO films demonstrated a slight increase of in work function (~0.1\u202feV), yet proved to be inferior to the effects of UV-ozone post-treatment [34]. In both studies, it was concluded that these positive shifts in work function due to surface cleaning methods were primarily due to two factors: (i) a decrease in carbon contamination and (ii) an increase in the stoichiometric ratio of AZO, [OZnAl]/([Zn]\u202f+\u202f1.5[Al]) [34,35]. Though a decent amount of AZO work function tuning procedures have been explored, there still may remain a number of tuning techniques which have yet to be discovered and, thus, it is important to continue investigating AZO work function tuning methods through novel and innovative approaches. In this study, a simple and straightforward work function tuning technique for AZO is revealed through the process of post-fabrication air annealing. As it has been shown that oxygen vacancies are one of the primary carrier doping mechanisms in AZO [36], basic air annealing is conceived to be a viable method for controlling the overall carrier density of the thin film material. In the case of AZO, an n-type degenerated semiconductor, the Fermi level, and subsequently the work function, is expected to shift with a change in carrier concentration [37]. Therefore, post-fabrication air annealing should prove to be a simple yet effective technique which can be used to control the work function of AZO. In this paper, we report on the work function and band gap tuning of AZO thin films fabricated via DC-magnetron sputtering through post fabrication air-annealing. The effects of post fabrication air-annealing on AZO's band characteristics, microstructural/chemical composition, and optoelectronic properties, are discussed in full detail.  AZO films were prepared via DC-magnetron sputtering utilizing a sintered 2\u202fwt% Al2O3-doped ZnO target. Before sputtering took place, the deposition chamber was pumped down to a base pressure of <5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126\u202fTorr in order to eliminate the presence of foreign contaminants in the sputter gases. Once adequate vacuum level was achieved, Ar was introduced to the chamber in order to maintain a working pressure of ~4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123\u202fTorr. Base and working pressures were monitored throughout the deposition process via cold-cathode and pirani gauges, respectively. Substrate temperature was held constant at 25\u202f\u00b0C (room temperature) and films were deposited onto both glass and Si substrates at a target-substrate distance. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of 10\u202fcm. The substrates were rotated at a constant 10\u202frpm throughout the fabrication process to ensure film uniformity. In order to secure consistency in the analysis of the AZO films, all films were fabricated at a thickness of approximately 200\u202fnm, which was measured using an FS1 multi-wavelength ellipsometer (Film Sense). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was implemented to determine the chemical compositions, chemical bonding, work function values, and valence states of both as-deposited and air-annealed AZO thin films. XPS analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS spectrometer under high vacuum (<2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\u202fTorr) with focused monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray radiation at 1486.7\u202feV and an electron flood gun in order to prevent charging of the thin films. Photoelectrons were collected at an angle of 55\u00b0 from the surface normal. For work function measurements, the samples were biased negatively in respect to the earth (Vbias\u202f=\u202f\u221230\u202fV) in order to accelerate the emitted electrons and detect the onset of emission. Before work function data was collected, a gold specimen was used as reference in order to calibrate the spectrometer and the binding energy scale, allowing for accurate determinations of both the onset energy and fermi level position. The work function of the gold was measured to be 5.1\u202feV, in good agreement with the reported value [38], validating the reliability of the work function measurements in hand. Crystallinity and structure orientation were investigated via x-ray diffraction (XRD) utilizing a Rigaku D/MAX-RC diffractometer by means of Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.54\u202f\u00c5) set at 40\u202fkV and 40\u202fmA. All samples were scanned continuously in a \u03b8-2\u03b8 coupled scan at diffraction angles (2\u03b8) ranging from 25\u00b0 to 75\u00b0. The surface morphology and microstructure of as-deposited and annealed films were analyzed using a Philips XL30SFEG scanning electron microscope (SEM). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Multimode, AFM Services LLC) was employed to complement SEM surface investigations and to measure root mean square (RMS) roughness of the AZO surfaces in a non-contact height mode. Both the transmittance and absorbance data of the AZO films in the 200\u20131000\u202fnm wavelength spectra were gathered using a UV\u2013Vis spectrometer (UV-3101PC, Shimadzu).  In this study, XRD and SEM measurements were employed in order to investigate the effects of post-fabrication air-annealing on AZO film crystallinity and microstructure. Fig. 1(a) shows XRD patterns of air-annealed AZO at varying temperatures of 25\u202f\u00b0C (as-deposited), 150\u202f\u00b0C, 300\u202f\u00b0C, 450\u202f\u00b0C and 600\u202f\u00b0C. XRD pattern analysis reveals that all AZO films investigated are in the crystalline state with preferred orientations located in the (002) crystallographic plane at a 2\u03b8 value of ~34.4\u00b0. This preferred orientation is the characteristic peak of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO [39]. Fig. 1(b) and (c) display the microstructural effects of air-annealing AZO via SEM plan and cross-sectional images of as-deposited and 600\u202f\u00b0C-annealed films, respectively. Notable grain boundaries are clearly observed in both SEM images, coinciding with the crystalline structures represented via XRD analysis. In regard to crystallite size, the as-deposited grains are shown to be approximately ~40\u202fnm in diameter when measured via plan SEM imaging, growing to grain sizes of ~100\u202fnm when introduced to air-annealing at 600\u202f\u00b0C. The same effect can also be observed in the cross-sectional images of Fig. 1(b) and (c), where the height variation on the surface is more prominent in the 600\u202f\u00b0C-annealed sample than that of the as-deposited film due to the larger average grain size of the annealed films. The increased grain sizes of the annealed AZO films can be explained through the phenomena of annealing-induced small grain coalescence via grain boundary diffusion [40,41], resulting in a larger average grain size while in strong agreement with other annealed-AZO and -ZnO studies. Fig. 2 provides further insight into the microstructural effects of air-annealing AZO, displaying changes in surface topography and RMS roughness due to increased annealing temperatures. Via non-contact mode AFM analysis, it can clearly be seen that the RMS roughness of AZO increases along with air-annealing temperature. While roughness values do increase from 25\u202f\u00b0C (as-deposited) to 300\u202f\u00b0C, the surfaces appear to remain relatively smooth throughout the annealing process with roughness values remaining below 3\u202fnm. When annealed at temperatures\u202f>\u202f450\u202f\u00b0C, the films exhibit a substantial increase in roughness, 5.12\u202fnm at 450\u202f\u00b0C and 5.71\u202fnm at 600\u202f\u00b0C, which is attributed to enhanced crystallinity and a sharp increase in grain size/coarseness. The microstructural effects observed in the annealed AZO samples are in good agreement with prior AZO research, where increased annealing temperature has been shown to directly relate to increased roughness and crystallinity [40,42]. Furthermore, the topographical images obtained via AFM in Fig. 2 are further verified via the previous XRD and SEM analyses, which also display an increase in crystalline structure in response to enhanced annealing temperatures. In Fig. 3 , the effects of post-fabrication annealing on AZO's valence band (VB) spectra in relation to the Fermi energy level are represented via XPS analysis. In Fig. 3(a), the peaks located at ~5\u202feV are said to be attributed to the involvement of both O 2p orbitals and hybridized O 2p/Zn 4\u202fs orbitals, whereas the peaks located around ~11\u202feV are indicative of the Zn 3d band [43]. The box figure located in Fig. 3(a) can be seen more clearly in Fig. 3(b) which exhibits a clear shift in both the intensities and the binding energy locations of the hybridized O 2p peaks due to the variations in annealing temperature. Once the curves displayed in Fig. 3(b) are linearly fitted, the straight-line intersection points with the baseline indicate the onset of photoexcitation, which gives the VB energy level, EV, in relation to the Fermi energy level, EF (EF is simply located at 0\u202feV since the EF of the sample and spectrometer are equalized.) [44\u201346]. Fig. 3(c) displays the direct relationship between the VB's proximity to EF, defined as EF-EV, and the temperature at which the AZO samples were annealed. As can be observed, a clear negative Fermi shift occurs due to increased air-annealing temperatures, with a maximum shift of ~0.4\u202feV occurring at 600\u202f\u00b0C. Since AZO is known to possess n-type conduction properties, a Fermi shift towards the valence band indicates a decrease in carrier density. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "due to an increase in annealing temperature. In order to further understand why annealing temperature plays an important role in altering the carrier density of AZO films, the fundamental carrier mechanisms of AZO must first be established. Generally, there are two primary mechanisms which control carrier density in AZO thin films: (i) the generation of zinc interstitial atoms and (ii) the formation of oxygen vacancies [36]. However, two aspects of this particular study eliminate the possibility of changes in Zn content in the films: (i) AZO films were fabricated using a single, hot-sintered AZO target and (ii) annealing processes were completed using identical samples. Therefore, any changes in carrier concentration of these AZO films can be attributed solely to the formation (increase) or extinction (decrease) of oxygen vacancies. As electrical conductivity is directly dependent on the carrier concentration of the material, the total amount of oxygen vacancies can be said to play a significant role in overall thin film performance [47]. The doping mechanisms in AZO associated with oxygen-vacancies can be defined by [48,49]: Oox=12O2g+VO..+2e\u2212 where O o x denotes an oxygen atom on the oxygen sub-lattice and V O .. is a doubly-charged oxygen-vacancy which liberates two free electrons, effectively doping the carrier concentration of n-type AZO. Thus, increasing the annealing temperature in ambient air conditions promotes the extinction of carriers through filling oxygen vacancies with the oxygen content available in the air, subsequently decreasing overall carrier density and shifting the Fermi energy level closer to the VB. The carrier density of the AZO films were characterized through Hall Effect measurements in the van der Pauw configuration and the results are shown in Fig. S1. The carrier density trend as a function of annealing temperature in Fig. S1 is well matched with the results of EF as well as work function and XPS elemental measurements that are discussed later in more detail. These measurements of EF, work function, XPS elemental scans and Hall Effect support the discussion that the oxygen vacancy-based doping/dedoping mechanism governs the change in carrier density of AZO in the present study. For the effect of surface roughness on XPS measurements, it has been reported that the surface roughness may produce a lowering of XPS signals that is of particular relevance to depth profiling for elemental concentration analysis as a function of distance from the surface of samples [45,50]. It also have been reported that although the surface roughness may affect the XPS intensity, the electron photo excitation energy is independent of the surface roughness [50]. Further, Gunter and Niemanstsverdriet et al. [51] reported that the surface planarity within the deviation\u202f<\u202f10\u202fnm yields no significant reduction in the XPS intensity because the XPS technique typically probes upper ~20\u201330\u202fnm of specimens. In the present study, the AZO thin films with a thickness of 200\u202fnm show changes in roughness <4\u202fnm as a function of annealing temperature. In addition, the determination of the Fermi energy level through the measurements is mainly governed by the photoexcitation energy (i.e., the location of onset binding energy) rather than the intensity. Therefore, the effect of the surface roughness on the investigation of the Fermi level is very minor or negligible in this study. In order to determine the effects of post-fabrication air-annealing temperature on the work function of AZO, XPS analysis was performed on all AZO samples (as-deposited and annealed) in order to determine both the secondary electron cut-off (SECO) and high-energy cut off (HECO) points of the films. Basic principles of electron spectroscopy [52] allow for the calculation of the work function through the equation shown below: \u03a6=h\u03c5\u2212\u0394E where \u03a6 is the work function of the material in eV, h\u03bd is the excitation energy at which the XPS measurements were gathered (1486.7\u202feV), and \u0394E is defined by the difference of the HECO and SECO kinetic energies. Fig. 4(a) and (b) display the SECO and HECO points, respectively, of the as-deposited AZO film. In order to determine the energy defined by the SECO point, a fit was applied to the linear regime of the curve with a baseline intersection point resulting in a SECO kinetic energy of 32.03\u202feV for the as-deposited film. Fig. 4(b) displays the HECO point for the as-deposited specimen, located at ~1513.20\u202feV. With the SECO/HECO analyses executed in conjunction with Eq. (2), the work function of the as-deposited film was determined to be ~5.53\u202feV. This process was then performed for all AZO samples under current study, allowing for the comparison of AZO's work function in respect to post-fabrication air-annealing temperature. In Fig. 4(c), the overall dependency of AZO's work function on annealing temperature is displayed, where it can be clearly seen that an increase in work function from ~5.53\u202feV to ~6.05\u202feV occurs over an increase of annealing temperature from 25\u202f\u00b0C (as-deposited) to 600\u202f\u00b0C. Since the work function of a material is defined as the required energy to remove an electron from EF to the vacuum level, the work function of a material is determined [53]: \u03a6=Evac\u2212EF where E vac is the vacuum energy level where an electron is positioned at rest outside of the material (free), and E F is the Fermi energy level of a material, the observed change in work function clearly agrees with the Fermi energy level shift exhibited in Fig. 3(c). Therefore, due to the direct relation of work function and EF, the change in work function via annealing temperature can be said to be primarily owed to an increased extinction of carriers as annealing temperature rises. The work function values of the films under current study are comparable to, while slightly greater than, the work functions of previously investigated heavily-doped AZO films (~4.7\u20135.2\u202feV) [24,54]. These slight differences in work function can be attributed to differences in fabrication techniques and parameters, such as chamber pressure and/or deposition power that may cause differences in doping level and film surface sensitivity during photo-excitation. However, it is the significant shift in work function (up to ~0.5\u202feV) due to varied annealing temperatures that is of particular interest, providing an alternate method. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "for the tuning of AZO's work function value. As mentioned previously, the ability to control the work function of a TCO film is of great importance when aiming to achieve Ohmic contact between the active/channel and electrode materials in an electronic device due to the enhanced charge transfer between layers [27,55]. Non-Ohmic contact may occur due to mismatched work functions of the separate layers, known as a Schottky-like barrier, resulting in an increase of charge obstruction and ultimately limiting the charge transfer between layers [27,55]. Thus, as stated prior, obtaining the ability to tune the work function of electrode materials is widely sought after, as mitigating the differences in work function between the channel and electrode layers allows for greater potential to achieve interfacial Ohmic contact. The trend exhibited in Fig. 4(c) shows substantial promise as it provides a relatively simple method to tune the work function of AZO through post-fabrication air annealing. In comparison to the previously mentioned methods for tuning AZO at a fixed Al wt% such as UV-ozone treatment (~0.4\u202feV shift) and acetone solvent cleaning (~0.1\u202feV shift) [34,35], post-fabrication air-annealing exhibits a substantial shift of ~0.5\u202feV when annealed at 600\u202f\u00b0C, indicating strong potential for the use of post-fabrication air-annealing as a viable work function tuning method for AZO. To further verify that the change in work function of the AZO films is due to the carrier density reducing effects of post-fabrication air-annealing, XPS survey and core-level high resolution measurements were performed with the intent of determining the surface chemistry of major elements (i.e., Zn, O, Al). In Fig. 5 , the full XPS survey spectra (0 to 1350\u202feV) of the as-deposited and air-annealed AZO films can be observed. Survey spectra analysis reveals no significant differences between most of the AZO films; furthermore, all films clearly exhibit considerable peak intensities from the expected major elements of Zn, O, and Al. Prior to detailed analysis, it should be noted that the small peak located at 290\u202feV is owed to carbon contamination, possibly introduced during sample preparation or during the deposition process. Core-level high resolution XPS spectra of these elements are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 displays the core-level high-resolution XPS of the AZO films' (a) O 1s, (b) Zn 2p, and (c) Al 2p peaks and their chemical state variations due to increased air-annealing temperatures. The core-level O 1s spectra show asymmetry with two peaks centered at 532.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202feV and 531.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202feV. Utilizing Gaussian fitting, these peaks were de-convoluted and, for sake of comparison, will be denoted as O1 and O2 peaks, respectively. The peak located at the higher binding energy, O1, can be attributed to O2\u2212 ions in the oxygen deficient regions within the ZnO matrix, indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies [56,57]. The peak located at the lower binding energy, O2, is characteristic of an oxygen-sufficient state and attributed to O2\u2212 ions on the wurtzite structure of a hexagonal Zn2+ array, surrounded by either Zn atoms or substitutional Al atoms [56]. The relative changes in the low and high binding energy peaks due to increasing annealing temperatures reveal critical information regarding the degree of O Zn bonding and the amount of oxygen vacancies in the thin film [56]. The as-deposited AZO films in Fig. 6(a) can be seen to exhibit a dominating O1 peak and thus are said to be in an oxygen deficient state. However, as annealing temperature is raised from 25\u202f\u00b0C to 600\u202f\u00b0C, the O1 peak decreases in intensity while the O2 peak increases in intensity, further verifying that the increasing of annealing temperatures promotes the extinction oxygen vacancies. This XPS data is in good agreement with both the VB and work function analyses, which attribute their distinct shifts to changes in carrier concentration via oxygen vacancy elimination. The Zn 2p spectra exhibits a doublet consisting of two peaks occurring at 1045.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202feV and 1022.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202feV and are characteristic of Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively [58]. The doublet Zn peaks are a result of spin orbit splitting, which occurs for the p, d, and f orbitals [59,60]. For both Zn peaks, no notable change is seen throughout the variation of annealing temperatures. In all AZO films, as-deposited and annealed, 2p3/2 peaks are observed to be highly symmetric, occurring at 1022.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202feV. This value is less than that of bulk ZnO peaks which occur at 1022.4\u202feV, indicating that the majority of Zn atoms in the AZO films remains in the oxygen deficient Zn2+ valence state in the ZnO matrix [61,62]. Furthermore, no metallic Zn peak could be observed at 1021.5\u202feV [62]. The Al 2p spectra exhibits a symmetric peak at a binding energy of 74.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202feV for all films. This peak is characteristic of aluminum oxide [1,2], indicating that the Al material present in the AZO films is bonded to oxygen. No metallic peak was observed at 72.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202feV [56,57], which indicates that the Al substitution of Zn in the wurtzite crystal structure went unobstructed and thus was not segregated as unreacted Al metal in the AZO films. The transition of the AZO films from an oxygen-deficient to an oxygen-sufficient state was further analyzed via elemental composition ratios, displayed in Fig. 7 . To provide a better understanding of the varying chemical states of the AZO films, the ratio of oxygen content to the present cation species (Zn and Al) and the ratio of O1 and O2 peaks can be seen in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The ratio of oxygen to cations were plotted as a function of inverse absolute temperature on an Arrhenius plot in Fig. 7(a) in order to obtain the activation energy of oxygen association/dissociation in the AZO films, which was found to be 33.3\u202fmeV. This is in good agreement with other activation energies found for oxygen vacancy annihilation in AZO films at similar annealing temperatures (32.6\u201391\u202fmeV) [63,64] while also closely matching the activation energies for oxygen vacancy annihilation in ZnO films (20.0\u202fmeV) [65]. The relatively low activation energy for changes in carrier concentration can be justified due to the fact that the donor level of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "native defect dopants (oxygen vacancies) is located in a shallow energy level within the bandgap (0.5\u20131.2\u202feV below the conduction band) [66\u201368]. Due to the close proximity to the conduction band, a low thermal activation energy is required to significantly reduce (or generate) the amount of oxygen vacancies in AZO films. This aligns well with the low activation energy derived as well as with the significant transition from oxygen-deficiency to oxygen sufficiency at relatively low annealing temperatures. To properly quantify the change in oxygen sufficient and deficient states, the ratio of the previously de-convoluted O1 peak to the O2 peak was plotted against annealing temperature in Fig. 7(b). As the O1:O2 ratio decreases, a higher oxygen sufficient state is achieved due to a reduction of oxygen vacancies. The shift from an oxygen deficiency to a more oxygen sufficient state starts rapidly from room temperature to 150\u202f\u00b0C, but shifted much less drastically after 150\u202f\u00b0C, which is in accordance with the previously derived low activation energy of oxygen association/dissociation. In order to analyze the effect of post-fabrication annealing on the optical properties of AZO, optical transmission measurements were gathered via UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy. Fig. 8(a) displays the transmission spectra for all AZO thin films over the wavelength range of 200\u20131000\u202fnm. The average optical transmittance exhibited in the visible regime is >90% for all AZO films. The films also exhibit sharp fundamental optical absorption edges near ~385\u202fnm, where light energy is absorbed due to the excitation of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band [69]. With annealing temperatures increasing from 100\u202f\u00b0C to 600\u202f\u00b0C, compared to as-deposited spectra, a clear red-shift of the UV absorption edge can be observed in Fig. 8(a), indicating a narrowing in the optical band gap of the material (E G). The shifting of the absorption edge to a greater wavelength region is known as the Burstein-Moss (BM) shift, which states that an increase in E G is the result of an increase in carrier density due to the excess filling of electrons in the conduction band [70]. This relationship is defined via the BM equation: \u2206EG=h28m\u22173n\u03c02/3 where m* is the reduced effective mass of the election, n is the carrier concentration, h is Planck's constant, and \u0394E G is the change in optical band gap. As discussed prior, the excess formation of Zn interstitial atoms is unfeasible in this particular study and, thus, it can be firmly stated that the variations in carrier concentration and optical band gap of the AZO films are due primarily to the overall decrease in oxygen vacancies. Utilizing the transmission spectra measurements to further verify this trend, Fig. 8(b) displays the square of the absorption coefficients, \u03b1, as a function of photon energy. As ZnO is known to be a direct semiconducting material [71], E G values were estimated via an extrapolation of the linear regime of \u03b1 2 vs. h\u03bd, which can be observed in Fig. 8(c). As annealing temperature increases from 25\u202f\u00b0C (as-deposited) to 600\u202f\u00b0C, the optical band of AZO decreases from ~3.55\u202feV to 3.37\u202feV, respectively. According to the BM shift, the optical band gap shift can be directly explained due to the change in carrier concentration, which is in agreement with previously discussed XPS analysis of increased oxygen vacancy elimination due to heightened annealing temperatures and also with typical degenerated semiconducting materials such as IZO, ITO, and ZnO [72]. Furthermore, in comparison to prior studies of the optical band gaps in AZO thin films (2\u202fwt% Al2O3) and their response to increased annealing temperatures, deposited via both sol-gel techniques (~3.28\u202feV) and RF/DC magnetron sputtering (~3.3\u20133.6\u202feV), the EG values of the DC magnetron sputtered AZO films in this study agree with established AZO band gap values and characteristics [73,74].  In conclusion, this study has demonstrated a simple yet effective way to tune the band gap and work function of AZO films via post-fabrication air-annealing. A notable work function shift of ~0.5\u202feV was achieved at an annealing temperature of 600\u202f\u00b0C, observed to be due to oxygen vacancy elimination. The increase in air-annealing temperature promotes oxygen in the air to fill native oxygen vacancies within the film, resulting in an overall decrease in carrier concentration and a Fermi shift towards the valence band. This theory was confirmed through XPS core-level high resolution analysis, where a distinct shift from an oxygen deficient- to an oxygen sufficient-state was observed in the O 1s peaks with increasing annealing temperature. For further verification of this trend, UV\u2013vis spectroscopic analysis of the AZO films exhibited a decrease in the optical band gap (~3.55\u202feV to ~3.37\u202feV) with increased annealing temperatures (25\u202f\u00b0C (as-deposited) to 600\u202f\u00b0C), suggesting a decrease in carrier density due to the Burstein-Moss relationship. Possessing the ability to tune the work function of AZO through straightforward post-fabrication air-annealing should provide an uncomplicated route for improved work function matching between AZO electrodes and various channel/active layer materials in novel electronic and optoelectronic devices.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Cupric oxide (CuO) is a monoclinic, p-type semiconductor material with a band gap of 1.21\u20131.51 eV. It is generally accepted that the source of the p type conductivity of CuO includes both cation vacancies and also excess oxygen. CuO thin films and its composites such as CuO/ZnO, CuO/Cu2O and CuO/SnO2 could be employed in solar cell, humidity and photosensor sensor applications . It also find applications to the fabrication of gas sensing devices, owing to the conductivity changes induced by the reaction of gases with surface adsorbed oxygen . CuO has been studied widely for its photoconductive, photothermal applications and in several high temperature superconducting materials . CuO films have been deposited by all conventional deposition methods, which include thermal oxidation ; electrodeposition ; dip coating ; chemical vapor deposition ; plasma evaporation ; and reactive sputtering techniques. The CuO films have also been grown typically prepared by thermal oxidation of copper substrate . In most of the studies, a mixture of phases, like Cu, CuO and Cu2O, are generally obtained at room temperature. This appears to be a major drawback of these methods for utilizing CuO films as a semiconductor. Physical properties of the obtained films seem to be influenced by the deposition method and conditions. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique has been used extensively in depositing nanostructured metal oxide films . The technique is equipped with excellent features, such as easy, low cost and simple as no sophisticated equipment is required. It is also compatible with mass production of the material in the desired form. The coatings produced with the spray pyrolysis are inherently uniform and the surface to volume ratio of the nanodrops is very large, making them very receptive to heat treatment and pyrolysis . The film thickness and stoichiometry are easy to control in this technique, and the resulting films are well compacted . In this report, the CuO film has been deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis on glass substrate kept at temperature in the range of 300\u2013400 \u00b0C. The use of aqueous based sols such as those utilized in the present work helps to eliminate environmental consequences caused by the organic solvent (typically alcohol). The structural, morphological and electrical parameters of aerosol spray-deposited CuO films have been investigated and correlated. On the basis of involved characterization techniques an attempt has been made to check the feasibility of the CuO films for gas sensor device applications.  The films of CuO were deposited onto glass substrate using 0.2 M aqueous solution of trihydrated cupric nitrate (Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O). To prepare 100 mL of the precursor solution the required quantity of salt is dissolved in double distilled water. Before deposition, the substrates were, firstly cleaned in nitric acid for eliminating any grease and, then with laboratory detergent and finally ultrasonically cleaned in alcohol. The preparative parameters of the ultrasonic spray setup such as nozzle to substrate distance, solution concentration, solution spray rate were optimized to obtain, pin hole free and adherent films of CuO. The substrate temperature was varied from 300 to 400 \u00b0C, in steps of 50 \u00b0C using electronic temperature controller (Model DTC303, Selec make) with accuracy \u00b13 \u00b0C. The substrates were heated by a specially designed electrical heater, and the temperature was measured using K type (chromel\u2013alumel) thermocouple obtained from Omega Engineering Inc. (USA). The distance between the nozzle and the substrate after optimization was maintained at 25 cm. The spray rate was fixed at 5 mL min\u22121. The solution was sprayed through glass nozzle using air as carrier gas on the, preheated amorphous glass substrate (\u223c2 cm \u00d7 4 cm of geometric area). All the films were allowed to cool naturally to room temperature on hot plate after deposition. The precursors used for film deposition was dried in an oven, collected and characterized via thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) using Perkin Elmer (Pyris diamond) thermal analyzer. The heating rate and air flow rate of 10 \u00b0C min\u22121 and 50 mL min\u22121, respectively, were adjusted. Alumina powder was used as a reference material in the analysis. The phase identification of the film was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, taken using X\u2019Pert Panlytical diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5405 \u00c5, 30 mA, 40 kV) in 2\u03b8 range from 30 to 80\u00b0. Texture coefficient was calculated using the equation given as : T(hkl)=I(hkl)I0(hkl)1n\u2211i=1nI(hkl)I0(hkl)\u22121 where I 0 represents the standard intensity, I is the observed intensity of the (h k l) plane and n is the reflection number. The information about the structural properties of the CuO films were done by evaluating the strain (\u025b), the average crystallite size (D) and dislocation density (\u03b4) from the Williamson\u2013Hall equation : \u03b2cos\u03b8\u03bb=1D+\u03b5sin\u03b8\u03bb \u03b4=1D2 where \u03b2 is the FWHM of the powder, \u03b8 the Bragg angle, \u03bb the wavelength of X-ray used. Lattice parameters (a \u2260 b \u2260 c, \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 90\u00b0 \u2260 \u03b2 for monoclinic structure) and the volume of unit cell for the CuO films were calculated using the formulas given below: 1d2=1sin2\u03b2h2a2+k2sin2\u03b2b2+l2c2\u22122hlcos\u03b2acV=abcsin\u03b2. To study the surface topography and compositional analysis of films, field emission scanning electron micrographs (FESEM), energy-dispersive absorption X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) spectrum respectively were taken on a JEOL JSM-6700F with a beam voltage of 30 kV. The thickness of the film was monitored using depth profiler (Dektek 3030 XT). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out in air at ambient condition (300 K) using Nanosurf easy scan 2. The electrical characterization of the film was done by using two probe technique by heating the sample with the help of a specially designed heater and the temperature measured using a K-type (chromel\u2013alumel) thermocouple placed on the middle of the substrate. The change in conductivity of the films was measured in the temperature range 300\u2013473 K, by applying a d.c. 10 V bias across the films with silver contact. The data so obtained has been. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "used to calculate the activation energy using the formula: \u03c3=\u03c30exp\u2212\u0394EakT where \u0394E a is the activation energy which corresponds to the energy difference between the valance band and the conduction band, \u03c3 o is a temperature independent factor and k is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature. The films were tested for their room temperature sensitivity to ammonia with the help of gas sensing set up and the data was recorded with Keithley (6517A) electrometer when 50 ppm of ammonia gas obtained from Chemtron Science (Mumbai, India) was introduced in the measuring cell of volume 500 cm3. The response (S) of a sensor is defined as the ratio of change in the resistance on exposure to gas to the resistance in air: S=Rg\u2212RaRa where R g and R a are CuO thick film resistance, measured in ammonia and air atmosphere, respectively. Activated chemical adsorption of a gas on sensor surface is given by Elovich equation , dqdt=a'e\u2212\u03b1q q=1\u03b1ln(a'\u03b1)+1\u03b1ln(t) where q is the quantity of gas adsorbed during time t, \u03b1 and a ' are the constants during any one experiment. The constant a\u2032 is regarded as the initial adsorption rate, and it depends on the activation energy . Constant \u03b1 is related to a measure of the extent to which the surface has been screened by potential barrier for successive adsorption.  Thermal decomposition of Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O precursor was studied in the temperature range 30\u20131000 \u00b0C and the obtained TGA and DTA curves are shown in Fig. 1 . The plots show that the thermal decomposition of the dried gel takes place in a single step and which results in the evolution of gases in air atmosphere. The chemical reaction that took place in the thermal decomposition is given as Cu(NO3)2+3H2O=CuO+H2O+NO2 The decomposition results in weight loss as shown in TGA plot, for which inflection point coincide with the temperature corresponding to minima and maxima in DTA plot. The weight loss of the precursor begins as heating is switched on at 30 \u00b0C. The main step in the weight loss starts around 219 \u00b0C, which represents the decomposition of Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O that continues up to about 400 \u00b0C. The corresponding endothermic peak centred at 254 \u00b0C can be noticed in the DTA plot. At 300 \u00b0C, CuO phase was formed which remain stable up to 800 \u00b0C. Therefore after analyzing various stages of decomposition that lowest substrate temperature for the fabrication of CuO polycrystalline film is taken as 300 \u00b0C. Fig. 2 shows the CuO films deposited onto the glass substrate kept at temperature of 300 \u00b0C with deposition time 10, 20 and 30 min. The obtained XRD diffractogram of the film are found to be amorphous and shows no characteristic peak of CuO when glass substrates are being coated for 10 and 20 min. The film deposited for 30 min spray time is polycrystalline in nature and shows the characteristic peaks corresponding to CuO phase. All the other samples in further studies were subjected to deposition time of 30 min. XRD diffractograms of CuO films deposited at different substrate temperature are shown in Fig. 3 . A matching of the observed and the standard (h k l) planes confirms that the deposited films are polycrystalline having monoclinic CuO. The diffractogram shows the prominent (0 0 2) peak of CuO located at 2\u03b8 value of 35.5\u00b0, with d value 2.528 \u00c5. Another high intensity peak corresponding to (1 1 1) atomic plane of CuO located at 2\u03b8 value of 38.7\u00b0 has also been observed. The positions and the d values of the diffraction peaks for CuO are in good agreement with those reported earlier for the spray deposited CuO thin films . The intensity of prominent peak is maximum when film has been deposited at substrate temperature of 300 \u00b0C. The XRD diffractogram of the films shows a gradual decrease intensity of prominent peak with substrate temperature. The maximum crystallinity as indicated by relatively intense diffraction peaks at substrate temperature of 300 \u00b0C may be due to the availability of adequate material energy for recrystallization at optimum rate . The change in intensity of (0 0 2) peak or the disappearance of small intensity peaks with substrate temperature in the films may be due to the difference in growth behaviour at different substrate temperature e.g. orientation of crystallites, phase composition, etc. The decrease in the intensity of the peak after 350 \u00b0C might be due to relatively lower thickness of the film resulted due to evaporation of initial ingredients before reaching to the substrate surface . It should be emphasized here that no peak corresponding to Cu2O has been appeared in the XRD pattern of the film deposited at various substrate temperature. The results reported earlier for spray deposited films have both CuO and Cu2O . In is interesting to note from the comparison of our observed and their reported from the XRD analysis that, the salt solution used for depositing film by aerosol spray technique might be responsible for variation in copper oxide phases in films. In addition, comparison of XRD analysis for CuO films deposited by other than spray pyrolysis techniques also show the co-existence of mixed copper oxide phases. Maruyama has observed a mixture of Cu2O and CuO phase in CVD grown copper oxide films prepared at a substrate temperature of 300 \u00b0C. Yoon et al. have observed a dominant phase of CuO in copper oxide thin films prepared using ion beam sputtering at a substrate temperature of 25\u2013400 \u00b0C. It is important to note that in the present ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique, copper oxide thin films with a predominant CuO phase has been successfully grown with substrates at temperature of 300\u2013400 \u00b0C. The preferential orientation of the deposits was estimated from the texture coefficient (T(h k l)), whose value equals to one for all the reflecting planes shows the random distribution of grains in the film, whereas its values greater than one indicates the abundance of the grains in a given (h k l) direction.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "For the T(h k l) values lies between zero and one indicates that lack of grain orientation in that direction . The diffraction parameters and texture coefficient for the films have been listed in Table 1 , and the (0 0 2) atomic plane in the film deposited at various substrate temperature reveals the preferential orientation. The preferred orientation of (0 0 2) plane for the film deposited at 300 \u00b0C and it goes on decreasing with increase in deposition temperature. The decrease in T(h k l) value with substrate temperature shows that films obtained have more randomly oriented grains. The preferred orientation of our CuO films is not in accordance with as reported by Kose et al. , for spray deposited copper oxide films. The disagreement might be due to the variation in the starting precursor taken for film growth. Texture coefficient value for the (1 1 1) plane is significant and quite close one. This reveals that particles are anisotropic in shape (non-spherical) and the deposited CuO grains tend to possess facet like morphology as evident in Fig. 4 . The average crystallite size (D) and strain (\u025b) values were calculated from the least square fit of \u03b2 cos \u03b8/\u03bb vs. sin \u03b8/\u03bb plots for all the prominent peaks of the samples as shown in Fig. 4. The intercept on the y-axis gives rise to the average crystallite size and the corresponding obtained values of the CuO films were mentioned in Table 2 . The average crystallite size is lowest for the sample with substrate temperature 300 \u00b0C and its value increases to 38 nm with rise in substrate temperature to 350 \u00b0C. The increase in the D value with substrate temperature might be due to decrease in the grain boundaries and so the amount of the defects in the films. The improvement in crystallinity is due to increased ability of adatoms to move toward stable sites in the lattice. The decrease in X-ray peak intensity of the film also suggests that, the crystallization of the film is declining with increase in substrate temperature. Maximum crystallinity and the lowest average crystallite size have been obtained for the films deposited at substrate temperature 300 \u00b0C. Dislocations are the imperfections in a crystal associated with the mis-match of the lattice in one part of the crystal with respect to another part. The dislocation density in our case is found to be decreases with substrate temperature and lowest for the film deposited at substrate temperature 350 \u00b0C and thereafter increases. Structural analysis of the films reveals that diffraction angle and the corresponding \u2018d\u2019 value of the lattice spacing (Table 1) of the preferential orientation of the films slightly changed with variation in the substrate temperature. The change gives the evidences of the strain in the CuO films. A positive slope obtained in case of CuO films deposited at different substrate temperature attribute to the presence of tensile strain. The magnitude of the slope goes on decreasing with the increase in substrate temperature suggests the decrement of the strain. From these results, it can be seen that the fundamental effect of increase in crystallite size is related to decrease in strain. The decrease in strain indicates decrease in concentration of lattice imperfections and formation of high quality films. As the substrate temperature is increased beyond 300 \u00b0C, crystallinity of the films drastically decreased. The lattice parameters are calculated and corresponding values has been recorded in Table 2. The lattice parameters have been found to be lower in magnitude as compared to the standard values. This indicates presence of more number of defects in the sample. The change in the lattice parameters and increase in the unit cell volume values (Table 2) with increase in substrate temperature also gives the evidences of the strain. SEM micrographs were taken to investigate the surface morphology of the CuO films and are embedded in Fig. 5 . The SEM micrographs show that deposited films are smooth and crack free with nano-sized particle agglomerates. The deposited films are homogenous, compact and pinhole free. The films morphology shows the random distributions of grains on the substrate. During grain growth, the crystal structure gets slightly distorted and results into trapezium shaped grains. For the estimation of mean nanoparticle size of nanostructured films, we drew a line on the SEM image and divided the length by the number of grain boundaries crossing the line. A mean particle dimension of 225 nm was calculated for the as-grown films at substrate temperature of 300 \u00b0C. The size of the particles which form these agglomerates, however, is much smaller than the grain size and is difficult to resolve. It was observed that CuO thin films deposited at 300 \u00b0C substrate temperature were smooth and dense, while the films deposited at higher substrate temperature showed rough surface morphologies. The grain size of the CuO thin films found to increase with the increasing substrate temperature, which was in accordance with the results obtained from Hall equation plot. On the other hand, the morphology of films was found to be influenced by substrate temperature. The morphology of films deposited at substrate temperature of 350 and 400 \u00b0C is similar. Increase in substrate temperature from 300 to 400 \u00b0C leads to increase of particle size from 225 to 500 nm following Fig. 5a\u2013c, respectively. Increasing substrate temperature leads to increase of particle size, but also lead to the change of film structure. This behaviour can be explained in terms of segregation of the grain boundaries. The EDAX analysis shows (Table 2) that the films deposited at substrate temperature greater than 300 \u00b0C are metal deficient. The significant oxygen enrichment has been observed in all film samples when the substrate temperature has been increased from 300 to 400 \u00b0C. The average of elemental composition in films shows that content of oxygen increases with an increase in substrate temperature. Atomic force microscopy has been proved to be a unique method to analyze surface morphology of a film. Fig. 6. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "shows a typical three dimensional (3D) AFM image of CuO film deposited on glass substrate at different substrate temperature. The surface evolution of the films showed \u201chills and valley\u201d like structures, which are uniformly distributed over the entire substrate surface. The 2D image (not shown here) of the deposits shows compact and granular morphology of grains. The height of the hills decreases, whereas the width of the valley increases with increase in substrate temperature. Higher substrate temperature favoured increase in film roughness and grain size as evident from the XRD and FESEM studies too. Ripening of the grains causes growth from smaller to larger grain by surface diffusion which reduces the surface to volume ratio. At higher temperatures (350 and 400 \u00b0C) the surface mobility of the constituent elements increases and the growth of facet grain is preferred. Also higher substrate temperature stimulates elimination of grain boundaries and results in the formation of larger grains. These observations are in agreement with Chacko et al. . Fig. 7 reports ln \u03c3 vs. 1000/T curves for CuO films prepared at substrate temperature of 300, 350 and 400 \u00b0C, respectively. It is seen that the conductivity increases with temperature indicating, the semiconducting behaviour of the films and suggesting a thermally activated conduction mechanism. From the slope of plots in Fig. 6, the activation energy for CuO films at different substrate temperature is calculated. As can be seen from Table 2, the activation energy of the film samples is in the range 0.311\u20130.293 eV. The decrease in activation energy with increase in substrate temperature can be understood from the increase in grain size. The growth of grains with substrate temperature leads to reduction in grain boundary scattering thus increases the film conductivity. The variation of the electrical conductivity of the films with substrate temperature is quite similar as the behaviour of the crystallite size with substrate temperature. It is expected that crystallization process increases with increase in substrate temperature up to 350 \u00b0C as indicated by the XRD diffractograms, leading to decrease in defects and consequently the decrease of charge carrier scattering at the defect. The increase in crystallite size with substrate temperature also reduces the barrier height at the grain boundary. This enhances the mobility of the charge carrier and thus increases film conductivity. It is well known that p-type conductivity in CuO is due to the presence of cation vacancy. This is because the electrical conductivity of CuO is directly proportional to the hole density. The hole formed by the interstitial oxygen and cation vacancy will affect the electrical conductivity. Increase in cation vacancy or the increase in interstitial oxygen as indicated by the EDAX data might also be responsible for the increase in hole concentration hence causes a considerable decrease in activation energy. It was observed from the electrical characterization of the films that when the grain size was increased, the activation energy and strain in films decreases. This observation is accordance with the results reported on the influence of the grain size on the electrical and optical properties of InP films by Oztas . It is interesting to note that substrate temperature is considered as an important parameter on the carrier concentration, which is enhanced due to increase in cation vacancy in the films during the film growth. The response characteristics of ultrasonic spray deposited CuO films deposited at different substrate temperature exposed to 50 ppm of ammonia are shown in Fig. 8 . A decrease in surface resistance of the film has been observed with the introduction of ammonia. This may be assigned to the redox reaction of ammonia with the adsorbed oxygen species O2 \u2212. It can be seen that CuO thin film sensor have good sensing performance, with high sensitivity and a short response time. The highest response of 0.82 has been found for the films deposited at substrate temperature of 300 \u00b0C. The higher response in case of sensor may be attributed to the lower grain size, and more defects in the material as suggested by Jimenez et al. . The response characteristics show that sensor recovers its original resistance in minimum time when ammonia has been ejected out from the testing chamber. The response of the film decreases drastically to 0.14 with increase in substrate temperature to 350 and 400 \u00b0C which might be due to the decrease in defects as suggested by XRD and FESEM analysis. In present study the change in conductance \u0394C is proportional to the amount of the adsorbed NH3 (q). The plot of \u0394C vs. ln(t) is linear after a time of 60\u201370 s for films samples as evident in Fig. 9 , thus indicating that the adsorption of ammonia on the surface of CuO films is in accordance with the Elovich equation. The values of the constants a\u2032 and \u03b1 were obtained from the plot, and corresponding values are recorded in Table 2. The initial adsorption rate has been found to be highest 2 (\u03a9\u22121 ns\u22121) for the film deposited at deposition temperature 300 \u00b0C, whereas it was decreases to 0.3 and 0.4 (\u03a9\u22121 ns\u22121) respectively for films deposited at 350 and 400 \u00b0C, respectively. The value of \u03b1, which represents the barrier for the successive adsorption is found to be smallest for (1.0 M\u03a9) for the film deposited lower substrate temperature and it increase to 2.25 and 3.33 M\u03a9 for the deposits at higher substrate temperature. This might be due to the decrease in surface to volume ratio of the nanocrystallites with higher deposition temperature and these are in conformity with the XRD, FESEM, AFM and electrical conductivity studies. Observations also reveal that ammonia gas sensor based CuO show much better response at room temperature in comparison to n-type materials for ZnO and SnO2 at 100 \u00b0C .

The properties of Cd1\u2212xZnxTe (CZT) make it a prime candidate for terrestrial photovoltaic applications . This ternary structure is one of the important semiconductor compounds, as a top device in a high efficiency tandem solar cell structure, due to its tunable physical parameter . CZT is a ternary semiconductor with a tunable bandgap of 1.44\u20132.26 eV. Solar cells with efficiencies of 20% or higher can be achieved by using a tandem solar cell structure, which consists of a top cell and a bottom cell connected in series. In this kind of a structure, the light passes through the top cell first which has a wider bandgap to absorb light of shorter wavelengths and the remaining light passes through the bottom cell with a lower bandgap to absorb light of higher wavelengths. For a tandem cell structure, the ideal bandgap for the top and bottom cell is 1.7 and 1 eV, respectively. Cadmium Zinc Telluride is a suitable candidate for the top cell and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) with a bandgap of around 1 eV is a suitable candidate for the bottom cell. Also, the high atomic number, tunable energy band gap to minimize leakage currents at room temperature, high detective quantum efficiency, good charge transport, high resistivity and high intrinsic mobility-lifetime (\u03bc\u03c4) products for electrons and holes offer it an attractive candidature as a good radiation detector and imaging device material. For production of large area applications of CZT based photovoltaic devices, thin film technology has to be applied. Several methods have been used to prepare CdZnTe films, such that molecular beam epitaxy , liquid phase epitaxy , electro-deposition , laser ablation , thermal evaporation , sputtering , and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) . Multilayer method of deposition was also tried by diffusion of elemental Zn into CdTe . From this point of view, the present work describes the fabrication of CZT thin films using interdiffusion of sputtered layers of CdTe and ZnTe and their subsequent analysis through photoluminescence and photoresponse.  At first, r.f. sputtered films of CdTe and ZnTe were deposited on glass slides at a pressure of 0.1 mbar with a net power of 200 W using 4 in. diameter targets of CdTe and ZnTe. CdTe was the bottommost layer while ZnTe was kept as the topmost layer, so as to ease the future electrical contact fabrication to the structure. The number of CdTe\u2013ZnTe sequence was varied from one to four and the corresponding thicknesses are given in Table 1 . The sputtered films were annealed in the same level of vacuum at 200, 250 and 300 \u00b0C\u2014only mixing among the telluride layers were required in the present case to form the alloy. Also it was found that for sputtered films, annealing above 300 \u00b0C resulted in development of pinholes on the film or their detachment from the substrate by breaking. The annealed structures were then tested using room temperature photoluminescence (Perkin-Elmer LS-55 spectrometer) property through an excitation at 490 nm. The change of resistance of the multilayer with time under illumination (photoresponse) was recorded using vacuum evaporated silver contacts on the surface.  The PL spectra are shown in Fig. 1a\u2013c, where \u201cL\u201d in the legend denotes the number of repetitions. In the photoluminescence spectra recorded for all the multilayer thin films, the general pattern is the presence of two broad peaks for each sample\u2014a lower intensity peak centered about 662 nm (1.87 eV) and another higher intensity at around 740 nm (1.67 eV). The intensities of the two peaks changed for each sample whereas the energetic positions are the same. This behaviour can be explained from the property of tellurium clusters as an iso-electronic exciton trap in II\u2013VI compounds, as reported earlier by several authors. Roessler found in CdS:Te that for concentration of Te around 1018/cm3, the PL spectra (with excitation of 435 nm) showed a higher energy band around 600 nm. As the Te doping was raised gradually, lower energy band appeared and eventually dominated the spectrum for Te concentrations above 1020/cm3. The high-energy band was attributed to an exciton trapped at an isolated Te atom on a sulfur site, whereas the lower energy band resulted from trapping by two Te atoms on nearest neighbour sulfur sites. Cuthbert and Thomas also showed that in case of CdS1\u2212xTex the spectrum with low tellurium concentrations was due to radiative recombination of an exciton bound to a Te atom. Similarly, tellurium was found as iso-electronic exciton traps in several other II\u2013VI compounds, such as CdSe , ZnSe1\u2212xTex as well as in ZnSe\u2013ZnTe superlattice and CdTe/CdS combination . From the discussions made by the above authors, it can be inferred here that the higher energy band around 662 nm possibly originated from a bound hole and electron recombining at a tellurium atom. The 740 nm band corresponds to the radiative decay of a hole and electron bound to two Te atoms at nearest neighbour sites. In analogy to the cases of CdS:Te and CdS/CdTe (where tellurium was forming a mixture with CdS), it can be inferred that for high concentration of tellurium, the height of the peak around 740 nm is indicative of interdiffusion among the layers. Thus for sputtered multilayers, PL peak of at 662 nm show that excitonic transition related to single tellurium atom is highest with two no. of repetitions corresponding to annealing temperatures of 200 and 250 \u00b0C. For three repetitions both peaks are most intense when annealed at 300 \u00b0C. Also, the intensity of the 740 nm peak is highest at 300 \u00b0C among the three annealing temperatures, indicating thereby that the interdiffusion (and corresponding defect generation) is maximum at that temperature. The multilayers were kept under a tungsten halogen lamp with 100 mW/cm2 intensity and the changes in their resistance (measured across two silver contacts placed 1 cm apart over the film surface) were recorded as a function time. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of illumination upto 3 min. The dark resistances were taken as that at time \u201c0\u201d. The individual resistances being different for each film, the normalized values of the resistances were plotted by taking the dark resistance as unity, so as to provide a convenient way of observing the fractional change in resistance under illumination. Fig. 2a\u2013c shows the fall in resistance (measured across the two silver contacts) with time at room temperature for the multilayers. When illumination is applied on the film, the initial high value of the photocurrent was due to the absorption of photon by the film. This created pairs of free holes in valence band and free electrons in conduction band. Most of the electrons were from the surface of the multilayer that moved from valence band to the conduction band. It increased the process of pair generation initially, which in turn raised the carrier concentration, resulting in lowering of resistance. The measured resistance fell with time and after some time either it showed a tendency of saturation or the rate of change was very small. The decreased rate of generation of carriers decreased with time and the process of recombination taking place to decrease the value of photocurrent resulted in a situation where the process of generation of charge carrier and recombination reached an equilibrium under constant illumination. As a result, the ultimate pattern of change in resistance with time was almost flat. From the pattern of photoresponse it was found that (i) for annealing at 200 \u00b0C, four repetitions had the lowest response while three repetitions showed highest response. (ii) For annealing at 250 \u00b0C, single repetition showed only 10% fall while three repetitions exhibited about 50% change in resistance under illumination. (iii) Annealing at 300 \u00b0C resulted in fall in resistance by 45% for three repetitions\u2014the decrease in resistance for other repetitions being much less. Thus, the multilayer with three repetitions showed the best response to light at all annealing temperatures.  CZT thin films have been prepared using multilayer comprising of r.f. sputtered CdTe and ZnTe. The structure was annealed at various temperatures with upto four numbers of repetitions of CdTe\u2013ZnTe sequence. Results of photoluminescence and photoresponse showed that multilayer annealed at 300 \u00b0C with three repetitions of CdTe\u2013ZnTe showed best behaviour. Further works in this area are on the way to improve the performance of the film and its applications in photovoltaic and imaging devices.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

There are two main approaches for harvesting energy and generating electricity: photovoltaic (PV) power generation by solar cells and concentrating solar power (CSP) from solar thermal energy [3]. Among the various components in CSP system, solar collector plays a significant role in the overall system performance. The efficiency of solar collector strongly depends on the optical properties of solar selective absorbing coatings, whose function is to maximize the absorption in Vis-NIR region and minimize the thermal emittance in mid- and far-infrared region [4]. A high solar absorptance can be achieved by a gradual decrease of refractive index and extinction coefficient from the metal substrate (infrared reflector) to the surface (anti-reflection layer). In addition, the occurance of destructive interference in visible and near-infrared region will also be able to improve the solar absorptance, which can be obtained by multilayer gradient coating, cermet composite coating and optical interference coating [5\u20138]. Among those, cermet composite coating with bi-layer structure, located between the metal infrared reflector and dielectric anti-reflectance layer, has been confirmed to possess high absorptance and low emittance [8]. Thus, it becomes the preferred design system. Initially, metal particles as the absorbing unit in metal-dielectric cermet coatings have been developed, such as Ni-NiO [9], NiCrOx [10], and Mo-SiO2 [11]. For those coatings, the metal particles are so easy to be oxidized during the preparation and high-temperature applications that its thermal stability or optical properties deteriorates obviously. To improve this issue, the nitrides of transition metals are taken into consideration owing to high melting point, extreme hardness, and outstanding oxidation resistance in consequence of high cohesive energy of pd orbital hybridization [12]. Thus, the nitride of transition metals, such as TiN, CrN, ZrN, HfN, NbN, TiON, and CrON, are chosen to as the absorbing units to take place the metal particles. Consequently, a lot of cermet coatings have been developed [13\u201318], for instance, the TiAlN combined the TiN (Metal-like materials, absorbing unit) and AlN (dielectric material) is usually designed as the absorbing layer. Whereas, the diffusion of nitrogen and oxygen and oxidation of the metal element also limit its application at 600\u202f\u00b0C or higher for long duration service [13,14,18,19]. Zr and Ti are same group element (Group IVB), ZrN and TiN possess some analogical physicochemical properties. What is more, the thermodynamical stability of ZrN (\u0394H\u202f=\u202f\u2212365\u202fkJ/mol) is better than that of TiN (\u0394H\u202f=\u202f\u2212336\u202fkJ/mol), and oxidation activation energy of ZrN (2.5\u202feV) is higher than that of TiN (2.05\u202feV) from 500\u202f\u00b0C to 650\u202f\u00b0C [20,21]. In this paper, ZrN is chosen as the absorbing unit and the AlN as the dielectric matrix for the first to design a new cermet coating of Cu/Zr0.3Al0.7N/Zr0.2Al0.8N/Al34O60N6. The optical properties, microstructure and thermal stability of this coating were investigated in detail.  The Cu, Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N, Al34O60N6 films and Cu/Zr0.3Al0.7N/Zr0.2Al0.8N/Al34O60N6 coating were deposited on Si(1\u202f1\u202f1) and glass (soda lime glass) substrates by ISB700 system. The substrates were ultrasonic cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 10\u202fmin sequentially at room temperature. The single layer (Cu, Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6) deposited on glass (soda lime glass) was used to the optical analysis. The films and coatings were deposited on Si(1\u202f1\u202f1) was for studying microstructure and thermal stability. A copper target (99.99% purity), an aluminum target (99.999% purity) and a zirconium target (99.9% purity) were sputtered by argon ion generated by a Kaufman ion source. The reaction ion (nitrogen ion and oxygen ion) generated by a Kaufman ion source bomdarded the substrate to synthesize the Zr1-xAlxN (x\u202f=\u202f0.7, 0.8) and Al34O60N6 sub-layers. In order to avoid the charge accumulation on the surface of insulation substrate (such as Si(1\u202f1\u202f1) or glass), neutral filament at exit of reaction ion source was use to neutralize the nitrogen or oxygen ion. The base pressure was 2.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fPa. The detail parameters were listed in Table 1 . The solar selective absorbing coating has to work under a good vacuum (\u223c10\u22122\u202fPa) at high temperature (up to 380\u202f\u00b0C when the heat exchange fluid is diathermic oil and up to 550\u202f\u00b0C in the case of molten salt) according to the concentrated ratio of solar radiation [22]. Considering the temperature fluctuation during service, we confirmed the annealing temperature was 400\u202f\u00b0C and 600\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. The coating deposited on Si(1\u202f1\u202f1) substrate was used to carry out the annealing experiment in vacuum (5.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122\u202fPa) ambient at 400\u202f\u00b0C or 600\u202f\u00b0C for different times. The optical constants of Cu, Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 films were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (Type: M-2000UI). Based on the optical constants of single layer, the reflectance spectra of the cermet coatings with four-layer structure were optimized and calculated by a commercial optical simulation programme (Version Name: TFCalc 3.5.6). The experimental reflective spectra at 0\u00b0 angle incidence were measured by UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Type: Hitachi U4100) with the wavelength range from 250\u202fnm to 2500\u202fnm. The reflectance in the range of 2.5\u201325\u202f\u03bcm was measured by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (Type: Vertex80). The total solar absorptance (\u03b1solar) is calculated according to the following equation: \u03b1solar=\u222b2502500Isolar(\u03bb)(1-R(\u03bb))d\u03bb\u222b2502500Isolard\u03bb where R(\u03bb) is the measured reflectance from 250\u202fnm to 2500\u202fnm, and Isolar(\u03bb) is the ASTM AM1.5D solar spectral irradiance, which is the reference after passing through the atmosphere 1.5 times. Thermal emittance (\u03b5thermal(T)) at the specific temperature is determined by the formula as follow: \u03b5thermal(T)=\u222b0\u221eIblackbody(\u03bb)(1-R(\u03bb))\u222b0\u221eIblackbody(\u03bb)d(\u03bb) where \u03b5thermal(T) is an emittance at the temperature T. In our paper, the temperature is 400\u202f\u00b0C. Iblackbody(\u03bb) is the spectral radiation of black body at 400\u202f\u00b0C according to the Planck\u2019s radiation law. The microstructure of coatings is investigated by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM, type: Tecnai G2 F20). The TEM is equipped with a high-angle angular-dark-field (HAADF) detector, X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) systems. The element distribution in depth was measured by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES, type: ULVAC- PHI 700).  Fig. 1 shows the refractive index (Fig. 1a) and extinction coefficient (Fig. 1b) of Cu, Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 films. The refractive index of Cu film shows the minimum at \u223c600\u202fnm, thereafter it increases with wavelength, where extinction coefficient increases monotonically in the whole wavelength range.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Additionally, the extinction coefficient value of Cu films is much higher than that of the others. Those results indicate the purely metallic behavior because the Cu film has high absorption in the IR range due to the phonon collision and free electron absorption. In the case of Zr0.3Al0.7N film, the increase of refractive index and extinction coefficient indicates the metal-like behavior. For Zr0.2Al0.8N film, refractive index reaches the maximum at the wavelength of \u223c320\u202fnm, thereafter it decreases. Extinction coefficient decreases monotonically, and the extinction coefficient value is between 0.2 and 1.15 in the whole wavelength range. Those results reveal the intermediate behavior (i.e., between metallic and dielectric). Both refractive index and extinction coefficient of Al34O60N6 film decrease with wavelength. The extinction value is almost zero, which displays the dielectric behavior in nature. The low refractive index contributes to the low front surface reflections (n 550 nm\u202f=\u202f1.69; R\u202f=\u202f6.6%). It indicates the deposited Al34O60N6 film is a good candidate of anti-reflection layer. A schematic diagram of the Cu/Zr0.3Al0.7N/Zr0.2Al0.8N/Al34O60N6 cermet coating and corresponding to reflectance spectra of theoretical and experimental are displayed in Fig. 2 . From bottom to top, the optimized thickness of Cu, Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 is 100\u202fnm, 65\u202fnm, 15\u202fnm and 70\u202fnm, respectively. Based on the optimized results, the Cu/Zr0.3Al0.7N/Zr0.2Al0.8N/Al34O60N6 cermet coating with approximately optimized thickness was deposited on Si(1\u202f1\u202f1) and glass. From the reflectance spectra of theoretical and experimental in Fig. 2, we can find that the experiment reflectance agrees well with the theoretical reflectance. The deposited coatings exhibit low reflectance (<4%) in 450\u20131200\u202fnm region (the concentration area of solar radiation energy) and high reflectance in the wavelength range of 2.5\u201325\u202f\u03bcm (near infrared and infrared region). The reflectance in the visible region is close to zero, which is contributed to the instinct absorption of the double-cermet layer and the destructive interference effects [6,23]. The change from low to high reflectance abruptly occurred near 1000\u202fnm. The sharp reflectance transition from solar spectra to the infrared wavelength range indicates the deposited coatings have the excellent properties of selective absorbing even at high temperature. According to the whole reflectance from 300\u202fnm to 28,800\u202fnm, the calculated solar absorptance is 0.953 and the thermal emittance is 0.079 at 400\u202f\u00b0C. The structure of deposited coatings was studied by TEM method. The thickness of sub-layer is measured in the TEM cross section of as-deposited coating. The thickness of as-deposited sub-layer is close to the designed thickness value, particularly for the Zr0.3Al0.7N and Zr0.2Al0.8N films. The slight deviation of Al34O60N6 film between designed and deposited value cause the slight deviation between theoretical and experimental reflectance in the wavelength from 250\u202fnm to 2500\u202fnm. Those results indicate the obtained optical constants is credible deposited process have high controllability. The SAED image of Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 is displayed in Fig. 3 b. Table 2 gives a diffraction ring analysis in terms of the corresponding phase and d-spacing. Three diffraction roles (r1, r2, r3) can be observed. After measured precisely and calibrated, the measured d-spacing (r1) of 0.2478\u202fnm can be indexed as h-AlN(0\u202f0\u202f2) reflection (PDF database file 65-0832). The measured d-spacing from the diffraction role of r2 and r3 shows that the interplanar distances of d2 (0.2205\u202fnm) and d3 (0.156\u202fnm) are assigned to the panels of c-ZrN(2\u202f0\u202f0) and c-ZrN(2\u202f2\u202f0) (PDF database file 02-0956). The measured d-spacing deviation the theoretical value is due to the substitution of zirconium atoms by aluminum atom which has the smaller atom radius than the atom radius of zirconium [24]. The diffraction role of h-AlN(0\u202f0\u202f2) is diffused and not sharp, which indicates the content of crystalline phase is less and the crystallinity is poor. In order to analyze the microstructure of single sub-layer, the HRTEM analysis of the single sub-layer is carried out. The crystalline phase of h-AlN and c-ZrAlN can be observed in the Zr0.3Al0.7N sub-layer (Fig. 3c). Additionally, a little of amorphous phase can also be noted in the zone A. For the Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 sub-layer, the amorphous structure is confirmed in the Fig. 3d. Based on the above results, the diffraction roles are from the crystalline phase in the Zr0.3Al0.7N sub-layer. The Gibbs energy of the formation of ZrN at 298\u202fK (\u0394GZrN\u03b8=-344.0\u202fkJ/mol) [25] is lower than that of AlN (\u0394GAlN\u03b8=-287.0\u202fkJ/mol) [26]. So, the nitrogen atoms arriving at the substrate surface are inclined to combine with zirconium atoms and synthesize the ZrN easily. Then, aluminum atom replaces the zirconium atom to form the Zr1-xAlxN solid solution. In the case of Zr0.3Al0.7N sub-layer, high zirconium composition is benefit to the crystal nucleus growth of ZrAlN. The formation of AlN crystal phase is related to the thermodynamic and kinetic factors. For the thermodynamic factor, the metastable c-AlN and stable c-ZrN have the same structure. The lattice constant of c-AlN and c-ZrN is 0.412\u202fnm (PDF database file 25-1495) and 0.456\u202fnm (PDF database 02-0956). What\u2019s more, the lattice constant of c-ZrAlN decreases due to the zirconium atom is replaced with aluminum atom, which decreases the mismatch degree further. The c-AlN can be formed on the c-ZrAlN substrate as the coherent growth due to template effect to decrease the free energy of system [27]. For the vapor deposition, it is well known that the most important kinetic factor is the mobility of the deposited particles [28]. Generally, the particles have high mobility in the surface of the heterogeneous material. With the c-AlN thickness increase, the strain energy increases, which results in the system free energy increase. The c-AlN does not grow as the coherent interface, and it transforms into the non-coherent interface. Without the template effect, the metastable c-AlN will transform into the stable h-AlN [29,30]. The Zr0.3Al0.7N sub-layer is mainly composed of c-ZrAlN and h-AlN with little amorphous. For the Zr0.2Al0.8N sub-layer, the crystal nucleus cannot grow into grain due to the low content of zirconium atom. The crystallinity of Al34O60N6 is poor. Hence, the sub-layers of Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 are amorphous. The annealing experiment was performed in a vacuum ambient (5.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122\u202fPa) using a tubular furnace. Table 3 gives the absorptance and emittance change of the annealed. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "coatings. The absorptance and emittance of the coating after annealing treatment at 400\u202f\u00b0C is almost stable. No significant change of reflectance between as-deposited coating and annealed coating for 192\u202fh at 400\u202f\u00b0C is noted in Fig. 4 a. Those results indicate the prepared coatings have high thermal stability at 400\u202f\u00b0C. In the case of the coating after annealing treatment at 600\u202f\u00b0C, absorptance slightly increases with time increase, whereas, emittance increases obviously. The photothermal conversion efficient (\u03b1/\u03b5) decreases from 12.1 to 6.86. The spectral reflectance below \u223c1500\u202fnm increases slightly while it decreases above \u223c1500\u202fnm. The microstructure of coating after annealing at 600\u202f\u00b0C for 192\u202fh was investigated by TEM. Fig. 5 a shows the TEM cross section of the coating after annealing at 600\u202f\u00b0C. Compared with TEM cross-section of as-deposited coating, the thickness of the Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 sub-layer keeps stable, whereas, the interface become obscure. It indicates the element diffusion is taken place at the interface. The thickness of Cu infrared layer become thicker compared to the pristine coating, indicating serious element diffusion between Si(1\u202f1\u202f1) substrate and Cu sub-layer. The SAED pattern for as-deposited and annealed coatings have the same characterization. Table 4 gives a detail information of phase analysis. For the absorbing and anti-reflection layer (including Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 layer), it also contains h-AlN and c-ZrAlN phase. However, the diffraction role corresponding to the h-AlN(0\u202f0\u202f2) becomes sharp, concentrated and brighter (as shown in Fig. 5b). It manifests the h-AlN phase increases after annealing treatment. To further confirm the microstructure of sub-layer, the HRTEM analysis was implemented. The Zr0.3Al0.7N sub-layer is mainly composed of h-AlN and c-ZrAlN with little amorphous (zone A). The Zr0.2Al0.8N sub-layer consists of amorphous and little c-ZrAlN phase. The Al34O60N6 anti-reflection layer is amorphous. From above results and analysis, we can confirm that h-AlN phase increases in Zr0.3Al0.7N sub-layer. The element distribution of as-deposited and annealed coating was analyzed by AES. For element distribution of as-deposited (As shown in Fig. 6 a), the sub-layer can be distinguished clearly. Around interface, the atom concentration rises or drops sharply. After annealing treatment at 600\u202f\u00b0C for 192\u202fh (as shown in Fig. 6b), the sub-layer of Cu, Zr0.3Al0.7N, Zr0.2Al0.8N and Al34O60N6 can also be found correspondingly, whereas, the change of atom concentration at interface become gently (see the shaded zone in Fig. 6b). It is noteworthy that nitrogen element in the Zr0.3Al0.7N films diffuses toward Cu and Zr0.2Al0.8N sub-layer terrible. The diffusion between and Si(1\u202f1\u202f1) and Cu sub-layer is also serious. In the Me-Al-N system (Me\u202f=\u202fTi, Zr and Hf and so on), the MeAlN is metastable phase. Annealing treatment at high temperature, the c-ZrAlN phase will transform into the stable phases c-ZrN and metastable phase c-AlN by spinodal decomposition initially [31\u201335]. Then, the metastable phase of c-AlN will transform into the stable phase h-AlN finally [32]. During this process, the Al-N bond will break, which results in the escape and loss of nitrogen atom [36]. A schematic illustration of the c-AlN formation after annealing treatment at 600\u202f\u00b0C for 192\u202fh is showed in Fig. 7 . The escaped nitrogen atoms can diffuse easily along to the grain boundary [37,38]. Those factors cause the serious diffusion of nitrogen atoms. In the case of the Zr0.2Al0.8N sub-layer, the c-ZrAlN phase is little, additionally, amorphous at the interface can suppress the process of spinodal decomposition [39]. There is a serious diffusion between copper and silicon due to the low active energy of diffusion (0.43\u202feV) and interstitial diffusion [40,41]. The diffusion coefficient between copper and silicon is high. Additionally, high temperature accelerates the diffusion process. Those factors lead to the serious diffusion between copper and silicon. Based on the knowledge of solid state physics, the infrared reflectance is positively correlated with the number of free electrons. The Cu3Si, Cu5Si and Cu15Si4 compound will be formed during the diffusion process between copper and silicon [42,43], which will decrease the number of free electrons. It decreases the infrared reflection and increases the emittance of coatings.  The high-performance Cu/Zr0.3Al0.7N/Zr0.2Al0.8N/Al34O60N6 cermet coating has been successfully prepared by ion beam assisted deposition. The experimentally deposited coating achieves the high absorptance of 0.953 and the low emittance of 0.079 at 400\u202f\u00b0C. Annealing experiment at 400\u202f\u00b0C in vacuum indicates the deposited coating exhibits the excellent thermal stability. After annealing treatment at 600\u202f\u00b0C, the photothermal conversion efficient decrease from 12.1 to 6.86 owing to the emittance increase. The spinodal decomposition of the metastable c-ZrAlN phase in the Zr0.3Al0.7N sub layer and the phase transition from c-AlN to h-AlN contribute to the nitrogen diffusion, which leads to the composition of the Zr0.3Al0.7N sub-layer deviates the initial design after annealing treatment. Additionally, the serious diffusion between copper and silicon substrate also increases the emittance of coating. The phenomenon that nitrogen diffusion is caused by spinodal decomposition and phase transition is a valuable discovery for the thermal-stability improvement of cermet-based solar selective absorbing coatings.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Functional materials, capable of removing contaminants, are in urgent demand. Many remediation methods, based on various functional materials, have been developed to deal with the water contaminants [3\u20135], such as electrochemical treatment [6], photocatalysis [7], biological degradation [8], flocculation [9], advanced oxidation [10], nanofiltration [11], and adsorption [12]. Among them, adsorption is considered to be the most feasible one due to its ease of operation, low cost, high efficiency, and no secondary pollution [4]. Although a variety of adsorbents have been reported to handle different kinds of water contaminants, most of them are in the powder form, making them extremely difficult to recycle since high-speed centrifugation and vacuum filtration are generally needed for the recycling. Therefore, the adsorbents bearing a three-dimensional (3D) macroscopic structure are highly desirable, especially hydrogels and aerogels [13\u201316]. Aerogels have been captured much attention over recent decades owing to their self-standing structure, an extensive network of channels, large specific surface area, and multidimensional mass transport pathways [17]. Diverse materials have been exploited for the construction of 3D aerogels. Typically, the world's lightest carbon aerogel was prepared using carbon nanotube as the ribs and graphene sheets as the cell walls, which exhibited remarkable adsorption capacity for oil contaminants [16]. Besides, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [18], ZrO2 and TiO2 [19], TiO2-SiO2 combined with transition metals [20], and a cellulose nanofibril loaded with graphene oxide (GO)-Fe (III) [21] were employed to synthesize aerogels for water treatment. Despite the progress in the fabrication of aerogel adsorbents, carbon-based aerogels have rarely been reported for the satisfactory adsorption of water-soluble contaminants, and there remains a pressing need for the development of novel carbon-based aerogel adsorbents with high efficiency and convenient recycling properties for processing water-soluble contaminants. Graphene-based aerogels are usually explored to tackle oily contaminants due to the hydrophobicity of the graphene surface [16,22\u201326]. The modification of the graphene structure is thus essential to construct a graphene-based aerogel for processing water-soluble contaminants. The most frequently adopted strategy is to prepare GO incorporating numerous oxygen functionalities. However, the active oxidation conditions result in GO with the sp2-conjugated structure damaged to a substantial extent, considerably sacrificing the fascinating 2D in-plane structure of graphene, e.g., the damaged conjugation structure weakens the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with aromatic contaminants. As a result, GO is generally used as a precursor to synthesize diverse functional materials. Before environmental applications, GO is usually converted to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with restored in-plane conjugation structure. Nature-inspired simultaneous reduction and surface modification of GO with dopamine (DA) is an effective and environmentally benign way to produce a surface-modified RGO. The polydopamine (PDA) layer generated on the RGO surface is nano-thin [27], revealing that the properties of RGO would not be blocked [14,27\u201332]. To the best of our knowledge, most of the materials involving the PDA-modified RGO (named as PG hereafter) are in the powder form [28\u201332], and it is, therefore, highly desirable to explore a PG-based 3D architecture to overcome the weakness from which the powdery materials are suffered. Considering that molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) also has the 2D planar structure (similar to graphene) and unique physicochemical properties [33], it was employed to construct a 3D ternary composite having the maximum interfacial contact area between graphene and MoS2 sheets as a result of the 2D-2D stacking. The interactions between MoS2 and RGO can also avoid the common aggregation problem encountered by graphene to some extent. Although composites of GO (or RGO) and MoS2 have been explored for many applications [34\u201345], the interfacial adhesion between them remains underexplored. For example, MoS2-graphene hybrids were fabricated by hydrothermal and calcination treatments and employed for capacitive deionization [34], a counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells [46], water splitting and lithium storage [35], and microwave absorption [36]. All of these studies were devoted to the construction of Van der Waals's stacks of MoS2 and graphene sheets, and the interfacial interactions between MoS2 and graphene were thus primarily dictated by the Van der Waals force with limited strength [34,35,38,46]. A lack of strong interfacial interactions between RGO and MoS2 would lead to the instability of the binary composite of MoS2 and RGO as caused by the aggregation of MoS2 and RGO sheets. The novelty of this work lies in the bio-inspired fabrication of a novel composite aerogel (consisting of MoS2 and RGO sheets with the strengthened interfacial adhesion given by PDA) for the adsorption of water-soluble organic contaminants, with ease of handling and recycling. The bio-inspired preparation process can be realized easily through a one-step hydrothermal reaction, without the energy-consuming calcination treatment, thus having advantages over the complex multi-step preparation process [45]. The role that PDA played in yielding a stable ternary composite aerogel was disclosed through an in-depth comparison between the graphene/MoS2 composites with and without the interfacial PDA layer. The microstructures of the prepared binary MoS2/RGO composite aerogel (termed as MG hereafter) and ternary MoS2/PDA/RGO composite aerogel (termed as PMG) were compared by various characterization techniques and systematic adsorption experiment. A toxic and carcinogenic nitro-aromatic compound (i.e., methylene green) [47] was selected as a typical water-soluble organic contaminant to investigate the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics. As a synthetic dye, methylene green is widely used in various industries including textiles, paper, carpets, ceramics, leather, printing, pigments, and cosmetics, etc. [48,49], which could pose a long-term threat to the living organisms relying on water in that its recalcitrant structure makes it resistant to the degradation by nature [50]. This study opens up a new avenue for the construction of various composite materials with adequate interfacial interactions between different kinds of functional compositions for a broad spectrum of applications even beyond environmental remediation.  Dopamine hydrochloride (98%) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Extra-pure graphite fine powder was obtained from Tianheng Technology Co., Ltd., Hong Kong.

Methylene green (AR grade) was supplied by Shanghai Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd. All of the other chemicals were analytical reagent and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. The GO was synthesized by a modified Hummers\u2019 method as reported elsewhere [51,52]. The synthesized GO (100\u00a0mg) was mixed into deionized water (50\u00a0mL) by sonication treatment for 1\u00a0h. The monomer DA (50\u00a0mg) and a tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane solution (20\u00a0mL, 50\u00a0mM) were subsequently added, followed by a hydrothermal reaction at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. The reaction solution was cooled down, vacuum-filtered, and then thoroughly washed with deionized water. The collected filter cake was finally freeze-dried and kept in a desiccator before use. The prepared GO powder (100\u00a0mg) was homogenized into deionized water (50\u00a0mL) by sonication treatment for 1\u00a0h, and then anhydrous sodium molybdate (300\u00a0mg) and L-cysteine (1.2\u00a0g) were mixed by magnetic stirring. Afterward, a tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane solution (20\u00a0mL, 50\u00a0mM) was added. The mixture was then hydrothermally treated at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. After cooling down, it was vacuum-filtered, thoroughly washed with deionized water, and finally freeze-dried. The obtained MG sample was kept in a desiccator before use. The GO powder (100\u00a0mg) was mixed into deionized water (50\u00a0mL) by sonication treatment for 1\u00a0h, and then anhydrous sodium molybdate (300\u00a0mg), L-cysteine (1.2\u00a0g) and DA (50\u00a0mg) were stepwise introduced. After the mixture had been homogenized by magnetic stirring, a tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane solution (20\u00a0mL, 50\u00a0mM) was added to adjust the pH to around 8.5, and then the mixture was subject to a hydrothermal reaction at 200\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. The reaction solution was cooled down, suction-filtered, thoroughly washed, and finally freeze-dried. The surface morphologies of the prepared samples were characterized using an S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, Japan), equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector. A JEM-2100F field-emission transmission electron microscope (TEM, Japan), equipped with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), was used to further clarify the structural features of the prepared GO, MG, and PMG specimens. For the preparation of the TEM specimen, an ethanol dispersion of the sample was withdrawn and deposited onto a copper grid, followed by air-drying. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were captured using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany). The functional groups of the GO, MG, and PMG samples were analyzed using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA). The chemical states of the samples were analyzed using an XSAM800-XPS X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with a Ma-K\u03b1 X-ray source. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution plots were obtained using an auto fast specific surface area analyzer (Chemstrat ASIQMO002-2, USA) based on the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) approach. For the adsorption experiment, the monitoring of the dye concentration was carried out using an Ultraviolet\u2013Visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometer (UU-1800, Rigaku, Japan). Raman spectra were recorded using a Witec alpha 300 conformal Raman microscope under the 532\u00a0nm laser excitation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) image was captured using a Bruker Dimension Icon System (Bruker Biosciences, Billerica, Massachusetts). Considering that the present research focuses on the fabrication of a 3D self-standing aerogel as the adsorbent to remove organic contaminants, the adsorption performance of the PG sample in the powder form was not investigated since the PG sample could be homogenously and stably dispersed in water media, making it extremely challenging to manipulate. We only placed the attention to the MG and PMG samples, and both of them could be easily handled for the adsorption test. The detailed procedures were presented as follows for the comparison of the adsorption efficiency between the MG and PMG samples. A given mass (15\u00a0mg) of the MG or PMG sample was mixed into an aqueous solution of methylene green (50\u00a0mL, 100\u00a0mg/L), which was then subject to the oscillation at 323\u00a0K. At given intervals, the dye solution was withdrawn for the UV/Vis spectroscopic measurements, and the typical absorbance intensity at 617\u00a0nm was recorded. The Lambert-Beer law facilitated the conversion of the UV/Vis absorbance to the concentration of the dye molecules that remained in the solution, and consequently, the adsorption amount could be calculated by Eq. (1): qt=C0-Ctm\u00d7V where C0 is the initial dye concentration, Ct represents the dye concentration at adsorption time t, m is the mass of the prepared adsorbent, V is the volume of the solution used for the adsorption test, and qt is the amount of the dye adsorbed by the sample at adsorption time t. The isothermal adsorption was investigated at different temperatures including 303, 313 and 323\u00a0K. Typically, 7 portions of the PMG samples (each of 3\u00a0mg) were added into a series of methylene green solutions with a range of concentrations including 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 and 120\u00a0mg/L. The mixtures were subsequently placed into a thermostatic oscillation incubator for the adsorption processing for 24\u00a0h at 303, 313 or 323\u00a0K. The equilibrium adsorption amount (qe) was calculated based on Eq. (2). qe=C0-Cem\u00d7V where C0 is the initial dye concentration, Ce represents the dye concentration under equilibrium, m is the mass of the prepared adsorbent, V is the volume of the solution adopted for the adsorption test, and qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity. A given amount of the PMG adsorbent (15\u00a0mg) was mixed into a methylene green solution (50\u00a0mL, 100\u00a0mg/L), and the mixture was subject to the thermostatic oscillation treatment at 323\u00a0K. At given intervals, the solution was withdrawn for the UV/Vis spectroscopic measurement, and the results of the adsorption kinetics were plotted and analyzed by the fitting. The used PMG adsorbent was collected after the adsorption reaction, which was then rinsed with deionized water several times. Afterward, it was successively washed with an HCl solution (0.1\u00a0M) and a NaOH solution (0.1\u00a0M) each for 30\u00a0min, followed by thoroughly washing with deionized water until the pH of the washing fluid was kept unchanged. The recycled and cleaned PMG adsorbent was reused in a new cycle, and a total of five runs were considered. The removal percentage was evaluated by Eq. (3). R=C0-CeC0\u00d7100% where R represents the removal percentage, and C0 and Ce are the initial. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "and equilibrium dye concentrations, respectively.  The main preparation scheme of the present study is depicted in Fig. 1 . The synthesis is mainly based on a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction without energy-consuming calcination treatment. There is a distinct difference in the structure and properties between the binary composite (without the interfacial adhesion provided by PDA) and the ternary composite of MoS2 and RGO bridged by PDA. The microscopic morphologies of the composite aerogels (i.e., MG and PMG) are observed by SEM (Fig. 2 ). Porous structure can be seen for both MG (Fig. 2(a\u2013c)) and PMG (Fig. 2(d\u2013f)). Through comparison of the microstructure of MG and PMG, it can be noted that the average pore size of PMG is smaller than that of MG, especially when one compares the SEM images of MG and PMG as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (f), respectively. Considering that the micropores are generated by the stacking of graphene or MoS2 sheets, the smaller pore size is an indication of a more uniform dispersion of the graphene or MoS2 sheets. This result also reveals that a higher extent of aggregation of graphene and MoS2 sheets most likely exists in MG as compared to that in PMG. Therefore, the introduction of PDA into the fabrication process of graphene/MoS2 can help to stabilize the dispersion of graphene and hence facilitate the formation of the PMG aerogel with a well-constructed microstructure. The photoimage of the as-prepared PMG is also shown in the inset of Fig. 2(d). The delicate flower can even support the whole body of the PMG sample even though the density of MoS2 is approximately 4\u20135\u00a0g/cm3 [34], which is much higher than that of carbon materials. The lightweight of the PMG aerogel most likely arises from its high porosity and highly exfoliated state of the graphene and MoS2 sheets. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution plots are shown in Fig. 3 . For both the MG (Fig. 3(a,b)) and PMG (Fig. 3(c,d)) samples, the isothermal lines exhibit the Type IV shape, which indicates the mesoporous structure [53]. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface area of the PMG sample is 98.6\u00a0m2/g, which is around 6-fold higher than that of the MG sample (17.2\u00a0m2/g). The smaller pore size of PMG relative to that of MG (observed under SEM, Fig. 2) can also be evidenced by the pore size distribution plot (Fig. 3(b,d)), as determined by the Barrett-Joiner-Halenda (BJH) method. For the PMG sample (Fig. 3(d)), the peak positions of the pore size distribution plot can be found at 3.9, 6.5, and 9.6\u00a0nm, which is significantly smaller than 19.0, 32.1, 82.7\u00a0nm for the MG sample (Fig. 3(b)). For more information on the critical parameters obtained from the N2 adsorption-desorption measurement, one can refer to Table S1 in the Electronic Supporting Information (ESI). The larger specific surface area and pore volume of PMG, with the strikingly smaller pore size, can be due to the well-formed porous network structure that consists of highly exfoliated graphene/MoS2 composite sheets. The high degree of exfoliation stems from the PDA-assisted dispersion and stabilization of graphene/MoS2 composite sheets. The oxidative GO tends to react with reductive DA through a redox reaction, resulting in the formation of RGO, and in the meanwhile, DA self-polymerizes into PDA that simultaneously coats on the surface of RGO. We thus speculate that the DA probably prefers to react with GO through a redox reaction when compared with MoS2, resulting in the PDA-coated RGO that would then further bind the formed MoS2 in a fast way due to the fascinating PDA surface, as schematically displayed in Fig. 1. The elemental mapping images of MG and PMG are presented in Fig. S1(a-e) and Fig. S1(f-k) in the ESI, respectively. Compared with MG, an additional element (i.e., N) is detected for PMG. The element N unambiguously originates from the PDA composition. The EDX spectra of MG and PMG are also provided in Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI, respectively. Although the distribution of all of the elements is uniform under SEM at the microscale, the aggregation at the nanoscale can be revealed by HRTEM images, as shown in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4(a), the TEM image of GO shows a large sheet-like structure with curved edges that exist for minimizing the high surface energy of nanosheets. The HRTEM image of GO proves its amorphous nature (Fig. 4(b)), which can be further evidenced by the SAED patterns that show faint diffraction rings [54], without noticeable diffraction spots on the rings (Fig. 4(c)). These results can also indicate a disordered stacking of GO sheets. Compared with MG (Fig. 4(d,e)), PMG exhibits a much uniform surface of the sheet configurations (Fig. 4(g,h)). The transparent PMG sheets indicate the vast extent of exfoliation, and no aggregation can be detected in the TEM image. By contrast, the aggregation of the MoS2 on the graphene surface can be found in the TEM image of MG (Fig. 4(e)), as marked with a red dashed rectangle. The spacing between the adjacent lattice fringes is also underlined for the agglomerate highlighted in the inset of Fig. 4(e), which is calculated to be 0.25\u00a0nm that can be assigned to (1\u00a00\u00a02) crystallographic facets of MoS2 [36]. The aggregation of MoS2 also results in the emergence of bright diffraction spots in the SAED pattern of MG, while diffraction spots shrink and become scattered along the ring as for PMG due to its polycrystalline nature [55]. The typical crystallographic facets, assigned to the MoS2 hexagonal phase, are marked in the SAED patterns for both MG and PMG. While the MoS2 nanocrystallites are well dispersed on the PG surface of PMG owing to the strong complexation interactions between MoS2 and PDA, the MoS2 tends to aggregate on the RGO surface of MG due to a lack of the interfacial adhesion afforded by PDA. Again, these results further demonstrate the significant role that PDA plays in the generation of a MoS2/graphene composite with strengthened interfacial adhesion. The XRD patterns provided in Fig. 5 present the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "crystal structure of various prepared samples. GO shows a typical XRD band around 10\u00b0, indexed to its (0\u00a00\u00a01) crystallographic plane. The redox reaction between GO and DA can be verified by the disappearance of the (0\u00a00\u00a01) plane of GO, and instead, a new broad diffraction peak at approximately 25\u00b0 appears, as generated by the RGO (0\u00a00\u00a02) plane diffraction. Based on the Bragg\u2019s law, the interplanar spacing (i.e., 0.36\u00a0nm) is more significant than that in graphite (0.34\u00a0nm), indicating the adequate reaction of DA with GO, forming the RGO sheets with disordered stacking. For both MG and PMG, the typical diffraction bands corresponding to MoS2 can be observed, in agreement with the JCPDS card (PDF#37-1492) of hexagonal MoS2. The XPS spectra of PMG and MG are provided in Figs. 6 and 7 , respectively. In the XPS spectra in the O1s (Figs. 6(a) and 7(a)) and C1s (Figs. 6(b) and 7(b)) regions, the oxygen-containing functional groups can be discerned through deconvolution, albeit with much lower contents relative to that of GO as a result of the active reduction reactions (Figs. S4 and S5 in the ESI). These functionalities of the PMG sample likely include carbonyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy groups. In comparison with MG, the lowered content of oxygen-containing functional groups can be noted for PMG, which is confirmed by the comparison of their high-resolution C1s spectra shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI. Besides, fewer peaks can be resolved for the C1s core-level XPS spectrum of PMG (Fig. 6(b)) when compared with that of MG (Fig. 7(b)); e.g., the peak, assigned to the carboxyl group, can be resolved for MG but not for PMG, which also indicates a higher degree of reduction of GO in PMG. Such a greater extent of reduction can be attributed to an additional reduction impact from DA, in addition to the hydrothermal reaction-enabled reduction. The existence of the PDA layer in PMG can also be confirmed by the TGA curves shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI, and the PDA composition accounts for about 3.2\u00a0wt%, similar to the result reported elsewhere [56]. Such a limited content of PDA is sufficient to offer a fascinating surface for binding MoS2 since the PDA is ready to form a nano-thin film on the RGO surface (Fig. S8 in the ESI) [28]. The enhanced thermal stability of MG and PMG relative to that of GO (shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI) also consolidates the hydrothermal conversion of GO to RGO. In the high-resolution XPS N1s spectrum of PMG (Fig. 6(c)), the peak around 394\u00a0eV can be assigned to Mo 3p3/2 [57]. A hump can be seen on the side of the Mo 3p3/2 peak, which can be further deconvoluted into two sub-peaks. One is centered at about 398.5\u00a0eV and can be assigned to the N group that originates from the pyridine-like structure of PDA, while the other is found at approximately 399.8\u00a0eV and can be indexed to the N-H group that arises from the amine groups in the PDA heterocycle [58]. In the high-resolution XPS Mo 3d spectrum of PMG (Fig. 6(d)), three peaks can be resolved around 231.1, 227.9, and 225.1\u00a0eV, which can be assigned to Mo4+ 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2, and S 2\u00a0s, respectively [38]. Compared with the previous report [59], the Mo 3d peaks in the XPS spectrum of PMG shift to lower binding energies, implying effective interfacial binding between MoS2 and PDA-modified RGO [60]. The high-resolution XPS S 2p spectrum of PMG (Fig. 6(e)) can be deconvoluted into two sub-peaks at 162.1 and 160.8\u00a0eV, which are corresponding to S2- sp1/2 and S2- 2p3/2, respectively. In comparison with the high-resolution Mo 3d and S 2p XPS spectra of PMG (Fig. 6(d) and (e)), a significant difference can be observed for those of MG (Fig. 7(c) and (d)). Two more peaks can be deconvoluted at higher binding energies in the Mo 3d spectrum of MG relative to that of PMG, which can be attributed to Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2, resulting from the oxidation of Mo4+ during the exposure to air [36,60]. Furthermore, one more peak assigned to S2 2- can be resolved for MG relative to that for PMG [60]. These results thereby demonstrate that PMG shows higher stability in comparison with MG owing to the PDA-aided stabilization. Raman spectra of the typical samples, including GO, MG, and PMG, are provided in Fig. 8 . In Fig. 8(a), the D band and G band can be observed for these carbon-based materials, which corresponds to the K-point phonons of sp3-hybridized carbon atoms and the E2g phonon of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, respectively [61]. The D band results from the defects and disordered structure, while the G band arises from the intact carbon planes composed of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms [29]. Compared to GO, the D and G band positions are red-shifted for MG and PMG, which indicates the interactions between graphene and MoS2 [62]. For PMG, the even more considerable extent of the redshift in the D band position is due to the PDA coating firmly attached to the RGO surface and the MoS2 nanocrystals anchored on the PG surface [62]. The D-to-G band intensity ratio (ID/IG) can be an indication of the concentration of the structural defects in the MG and PMG sample (Fig. 8(b)). Compared to GO, the ID/IG ratio is steeply increased for MG, along with the considerably increased full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the D band (Fig. 8(c)) and the slighted decreased FWHM of the G band (Fig. 8(d)). These results indicate that the greater extent of structural disorder is introduced in MG, with a more significant number of the sp2-hybridized carbon domains [63,64], as generated by the hydrothermal-induced reduction and restoration. Interestingly, the ID/IG ratio calculated for PMG is much smaller than that for MG, even slightly smaller than that for GO, together with the smallest FWHM of the D band and largest FWHM of the G band. The introduction of DA in the hydrothermal reaction system can significantly alter the microstructure of PMG,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "in stark contrast to the counterpart prepared in the absence of DA (Fig. 1). The double reduction effects from the hydrothermal reaction and the redox reaction imparted via DA facilitate the vast extent of graphitization of the RGO sheets. The uniform PDA coating on the RGO surface is favorable for the uniform binding of the nano-size MoS2 crystals, as evidenced by the TEM images (Fig. 4(g,h)) and the SAED patterns (Fig. 4(i)). The adsorption of a water-soluble organic pollutant is presented to demonstrate the potential of the prepared PMG aerogel for environmental remediation, and the results are provided in Fig. 9 (a\u2013i). The adsorption efficiency between MG and PMG is first compared (Fig. 9(a)). During the adsorption process, the adsorption amount of PMG toward methylene green is higher than that of MG at any duration, suggesting that the PMG has an overwhelmingly better adsorption performance for the organic contaminant. In addition to methylene green, methylene blue was also used to confirm this result, and PMG is also obviously superior to MG in the uptake of methylene blue (Table S2 in the ESI). The focus is then brought to the analysis of the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics of the system with PMG. For the adsorption kinetics, the obtained data were fitted by the commonly-used pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, which can be expressed by Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively. logqe-qt=logqe-k12.303t tqt=1k2qe2+tqe where qe and qt represent the equilibrium adsorption capacity and adsorption amount at time t, respectively, and k1 and k2 are the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order rate constants, respectively. The adsorption of methylene green onto PMG better follows the pseudo-second-order model (Fig. 9(c)) as compared to the pseudo-first-order model (Fig. 9(b)); this is evidenced by the improved correlation coefficient value being close to 1 during the fitting under the pseudo-second-order model. From Table S3 in the ESI, it can also be noted that there is a significant difference between the measured (qe, exp) and calculated (qe,cal) equilibrium adsorption amounts, as obtained by fitting with the pseudo-first-order model, while qe, exp is close to qe,cal under the pseudo-second-order model. These results indicate that the pseudo-first-order model is not suitable for the description of the experimental data, whereas they can be well described by the pseudo-second-order model which is based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step is determined by chemical sorption [65]. For the investigation of the adsorption isotherms, the two most commonly-used adsorption isotherm models were adopted for the analysis of the experimental data, namely Langmuir and Freundlich models. The Langmuir model assumes that the dye molecules are adsorbed onto the homogenous surface in the monolayer fashion and that there are no interactions between the adsorbate molecules on the adsorbent surface. The Langmuir model can be expressed as Eq. (6): qe=qmaxkLCe1+kLCe A linear form can be described by Eq. (7): Ceqe=Ceqmax+1qmaxkL where Ce represents the equilibrium dye concentration in the solution, qe is the equilibrium adsorption amount, qmax denotes the maximum amount of methylene green adsorbed by the per unit weight of PMG to form a complete monolayer on the surface bound at high Ce, and kL is the Langmuir constant that is related to the affinity of the binding sites. For the evaluation of whether the adsorption reaction is favorable, unfavorable or irreversible, one can refer to Eq. (8): RL=11+kLC0 where kL represents the Langmuir constant, and C0 denotes the maximum concentration of the initial dye solutions. The value RL can be used to indicate the favorability of the adsorption reaction, which is presented as follows: RL>1, unfavorable RL<1, favorable RL\u00a0=\u00a01, Linear RL\u00a0=\u00a00, irreversible The Freundlich model is based on the assumption that the adsorption takes place on the inhomogeneous surface in the multilayer fashion, and that there exist interactions between adsorbed dye molecules. The Freundlich model can be expressed by Eq. (9), with the linear form described by Eq. (10): qe=kFCe1/n lnqe=lnkF+1nlnCe where Ce and qe are the dye concentration and adsorption amount under equilibrium, respectively, and kF represents the Freundlich constant that is correlated to the adsorption capacity. The isothermal adsorption results are shown in Fig. 9(d\u2013f) and (g\u2013i). All the adsorption system at different temperatures can be better fitted by the Langmuir model, indicating the homogenous adsorption of the dye molecules onto the PMG surface with a homogeneous PDA layer and uniformly distributed MoS2 nanocrystallites. The adsorption at higher temperatures yields a larger maximum adsorption capacity (i.e., qmax), as shown in Table S4 in the ESI. The qmax is calculated as 201.2, 227.8, and 235.3\u00a0mg/g for PMG at 303, 313, and 323\u00a0K, respectively, implying an endothermic adsorption process. The calculated qmax is much larger than that of some adsorbents reported for the uptake of methylene green (Table S5 in the ESI), such as nanoporous cobalt/carbon materials (~72\u00a0mg/g) [66], fungus-like MoS2 nanosheets (~63\u00a0mg/g) [67], and MoS2 nanosheets decorated with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (~20\u00a0mg/g) [68]. The RL values are also presented in Table S4 in the ESI, and all of them are in the range of 0\u20131. The adsorption is thus favorable for all the systems under different temperature conditions. Apart from the excellent adsorption capacity of the PMG aerogel adsorbent, it also exhibits satisfactory recycling properties (Fig. S9 in the ESI) due to the adequate interfacial adhesion afforded by PDA that stabilizes both the MoS2 and RGO. Additionally, all the 1/n values listed in Table S4 in the ESI are in the range of 0.1\u20130.5, also revealing the favorable adsorption at all the temperatures. Based on the isothermal adsorption at different temperatures, the thermodynamics of the adsorption of methylene green on the PMG samples can be analyzed. The enthalpy change \u0394H and entropy change \u0394S can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear fitting line (Eq. (11)), respectively, and the Gibbs free energy change \u0394G can be obtained based on Eq. (12). logqeCe=\u0394S2.303R-\u0394H2.303RT \u0394G=\u0394H-T\u0394S From Table S6 in the ESI, it can be noted that the \u0394G\u00b0 value is negative for all the adsorption system regardless of the initial dye concentration and reaction temperatures,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "which indicates that the dye molecules can be spontaneously adsorbed onto the PMG surface. The positive \u0394H\u00b0 value is an indication of the endothermic adsorption process, while the positive \u0394S\u00b0 value implies that the adsorption of the dye molecules causes the homogenous PMG surface to be disordered. It is also worth pointing out that the weakness of the bio-inspired aerogel adsorbent lies in the diffusion barrier (generated by its microchannels) to the dye molecules and its closed micropores that are inaccessible to the dye molecules, lowering its adsorption performance when compared to the powdery adsorbent that can be highly exfoliated and dispersed in the solution where the adsorption takes place. It is believed that the adsorption performance of the bio-inspired composite aerogel can be further improved through structural optimization (e.g., tuning the ratio of MoS2 to RGO).  We have developed a facile one-step hydrothermal route to the 3D composite aerogel with the bio-inspired adhesion of graphene and MoS2 based on PDA, without energy-consuming calcination processing. The biomolecule DA plays a pivotal role in the formation of well-constructed composite aerogel with uniformly dispersed MoS2 nanocrystallites on the surface of PDA-modified graphene without aggregation. Without the bio-inspired interfacial adhesion, the aggregation of MoS2 nanocrystallites occurs, leading to substantial decreases in both the specific surface area and total pore volume, and a considerable increase in the average pore size, in comparison with the case with additional bio-inspired adhesion interactions between graphene and MoS2. The presence of PDA can also impede the oxidation of MoS2 when exposure to air. Such a composite aerogel prepared by the bio-inspired one-step process shows an excellent adsorption capacity toward methylene green, together with satisfactory recycling properties, and the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic, and well follows the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetics.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Currently, conductive oxides (e.g., indium tin oxide; ITO) have been widely employed in various electronic gadgets, including smart phones, flat-panel televisions, solar cells, and solid-state lighting devices because of their high optical transparency and conductivity . However, despite the excellent electrical and optical properties of ITO, it has a limited application in flexible TCEs since ITO is mechanically brittle and is easily cracked under bending . Both price of its source element (indium) and production cost under high temperature and vacuum processing are also expensive for large-scale deployment. As a result, there has been a continuous and increasing demand to replace ITO with novel transparent conducting materials . In this context, networks of silver nanowires (Ag NWs) have been considered as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to ITO for stretchable and flexible electrodes, since Ag NW-based conductors are mechanically durable and possess higher optical transparency than ITO at equivalent sheet resistance (R s) . However, Ag NW networks suffer from disadvantages limiting their application in commercial devices. For instance, inherent junction resistance associated with charge transport between randomly oriented nanowires reduces the electrical conductivity . Although this may be overcome by welding at overlapping junctions, such temperature treatment could damage substrates and underlying components . Ag NW networks have a high contact resistance between network and active materials . To address the problems of Ag NW networks, it has been a highlight to introduce Ag NWs with a secondary conductive nanostructure to form a hybrid for forging inter-nanowire connection and enhancing performance . That is, the hybrids of Ag NWs and conductive nanostructures have been developed with a combination of different nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, conductive polymers, metal oxide, and graphene . Especially, hybridization of Ag NWs with a two-dimensional graphene appears to be promising to address various issues. Hybrid structure shows enhanced conductivity with excellent optical properties . Together at junctions and to substrates, Ag NWs are tightly held and adhered to the substrate, thereby hindering fracturing of Ag NWs under tension . It shows high mechanical flexibility and stretchability after hybrid formation, allowing its potential use for high-performance flexible electronics. For instance, Liang et al. reported a hybrid of Ag NW and graphene prepared by solution based process of Ag NW and graphene, which exhibited high optical transmittance (TT) (88%) and low R s (22 \u03a9/sq.) . UV light-emitting diodes based on Ag NW and graphene hybrids were demonstrated by Seo et al . In another work, Kholmanov et al. presented a conductor with good electrical and optical properties (TT: 90%, R s: 64 \u03a9/sq.) built on a hybrid of Ag NW and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene through a modified graphene transfer approach . Lee et al. also reported a high performance stretchable TCE using a hybrid of Ag NW and CVD graphene . Chen et al. presented highly conductive free standing paper with graphene/Ag NW hybrid . Recently, Park et al. presented soft transparent electrodes for an inorganic light-emitting diode fitted on a soft eye contact lens with an Ag NW and graphene hybrid . All the above-mentioned studies indicate the potential of Ag NW and graphene hybrid systems toward various types of transparent electrodes, exhibiting superior electrical and optical properties to ITO . To further boost the conductivity of Ag NW/graphene hybrid films, it is necessary to enhance the electrical property of either Ag NW or graphene, and reduce the contact resistance between them. However, it is difficult to enhance the electrical property of Ag NW without compromising the optical property of the hybrid because of high diffused light scattering of Ag NW . Alternatively, several studies have been conducted to enhance the electrical properties of the hybrids through graphene modification. Choi et al. reported an optimized chemical doping process of the hybrid of Ag NW and graphene . Lee et al. demonstrated the improved conductivity of the hybrid films by applying a non-uniform electric field on graphene . In this work, we achieved the conductivity enhancement of Ag NW/graphene hybrid films by implementing dual-doped graphene where the top and bottom sides of graphene were doped with various chemical dopants (p-type dopant: HNO3 or Au; n-type dopant: N2H4). By applying the simple dual co-doping approach of graphene, the work function of graphene can be effectively engineered, resulting in the conductivity enhancement of graphene and the contact resistance reduction between graphene and Ag NWs. Different from the previous bottom-doping approach based on single graphene etchant (e.g., benzimidazole) , our novel doping process composed of bottom and top co-doping has versatility in terms of chemical dopant types for bottom doping. We investigated the effects of doping on the materials through the systematic analyses of their surface, electrical, and optical properties. We found that, in the case of HNO3 p-doing and N2H4 n-doping, the p/p-type dual-doping is the most effective to enhance the conductivity, compared with other combinations (n/p, p/n, and n/n). We also observed that the p/p-type dual-doping can further improve the conductivity of Ag NW/graphene hybrid system. The enhanced conductivity of graphene by the dual-doping reduces contact resistance between Ag NWs and graphene, leading to the formation of the co-percolating network where Ag NWs can be an additional conductive path at the grain boundary of the polycrystalline graphene. Note that Ag NW/dual-doped graphene hybrids with enhanced conductivity do not exhibits any significant compromise of optical transmittance.  We used polycrystalline graphene (4\u2033 Monolayer Graphene on Cu foil) purchased from Graphene square (Korea), which was grown by CVD on a Cu substrate. Ag NWs with an average length of 20 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm and an average diameter of 30 \u00b1 5 nm were obtained from Aiden Co. (Korea) and used without further purification. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise specified. Conducting Films of Doped Graphene: Schematic procedures and structures of doped graphenes and hybrid conducting films are shown in Scheme 1 . Briefly, as-received. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "graphene on Cu foil was covered by a layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) by spin-coating and subjected to removal of its copper substrate by a Cu etchant (FeCl3). Subsequently, Cu substrate-etched free-standing graphene/PMMA bilayers were floated on deionized water to remove/dissolve remnant Cu etchant (FeCl3) under the graphene. For bottom doping, as-rinsed graphene/PMMA bilayers were re-floated on a doping solution of various p- or n-type dopants for 5\u201310 min. A dilute aqueous solution of HNO3 or AuCl3 was used for p-doping, and a hydrazine (N2H4) solution (1 M; 60 \u030aC) was employed for n-doping. After bottom-doping, doped graphene/PMMA bilayers were transferred onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, rinsed with acetone for removal of the PMMA supporting layer, and subjected to top-doping. We applied a conventional vapor-phase doping process by putting graphene under HNO3 vapor for 3 min (p-doping) or N2H4 vapor for 10 min (n-doping). Some samples were top-side doped by applying a p-type doping solution of AuCl3 (0.1\u20131 M) dissolved in nitromethane through spin-coating onto the graphene. We also prepared various dual-doped graphene samples with a combination of doping systems (p-/p-, p-/n-, n-/p-, and n-/n-types) to study the dopant-type effects. Hybrid Conducting Films of Ag NW and doped Graphene: We prepared the hybrid conducting film of the Ag NW network and graphene by a wire-bar coating. A solution of Ag NW (0.15 wt% of Ag NWs in a coating solution) was spread onto the graphene by the Meyer rod (RDS 3; 30 mm/sec). The R s of the Ag NW network can be regulated by controlling its wet thickness after solution coating. After deposition of Ag NWs on graphene, the films were annealed at 100 \u030aC for 5 min in the oven to completely remove the solvent. The morphology and surface properties of the samples were characterized through various imaging and spectroscopic tools. The surface morphology of hybrid films was imaged by a scanning electron microscope (SEM; NOVA NanoSEM 630) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The chemical bonds of the samples were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Escalab 250) with an Al K\u03b1 (1486.6 eV) source. The Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw Raman Spectrometer under backscattering geometry. Spectra were averaged over 20 accumulations, and the laser power (633 nm) was kept at 2.5 mW. The optical transmittance of the films including the substrate (PET) was recorded on a haze meter (NDH 5000). The R s was measured by an in-line four-point probe surface resistivity meter (R-CHEK, RC2175). The R s reported in this work is an average of at least five points for each sample.  Hybrid transparent conducting films demonstrated in this work were prepared by bottom-doping and top-doping of graphene followed by hybridization with Ag NWs, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The aim of our novel dual co-doping process was to enable high-performance transparent conducting films without significant debilitation of optical properties. First, CVD-grown graphene on a copper substrate was covered by PMMA, which acted as a carrier film and a protecting layer during bottom-doping (a\u2192b). Cu substrate was then etched by Cu-etchant (FeCl3) (b\u2192c). Note that, although FeCl3 has been shown to act as a p-type dopant for graphene , we have thoroughly washed the Cu-etchant (FeCl3) on graphene with a copious amount of water after the etching process. The surface investigation with XPS confirmed that the graphene is free from FeCl3 (Fig. S2). The PMMA/graphene was subject to bottom-doping by placing the bilayer on a doping solution with a controlled concentration (c\u2192d), followed by transferring onto a plastic substrate (PET) (d\u2192e) and removal of PMMA (e\u2192f). Unlike bottom-doping, top-doping was performed through a vapor treatment to minimize any damage of the graphene (f\u2192g). Simple bar-coating resulted in a formation of the well-controlled Ag NW network onto the graphene (g\u2192h). The as-formed Ag NW/dual-doped graphene hybrid films had a low R s (188 \u03a9/sq.) and high transmittance (97.4, 90.5%, including PET substrate). Fig. 1 displays the SEM images of the pristine and hybrid films obtained at different preparation stages and a digital photo image of a hybrid transparent electrode built on a plastic substrate (PET). Fig. 1a is an image of pristine graphene, while Fig. 1b and c shows doped graphene. Graphene samples before hybridization show a smooth surface without any noticeable features. After single and dual-doping, it does not show any significant change in the graphene morphology. A hybrid of Ag NW and doped graphene shown in Fig. 1d shows a clear network of Ag NWs formed on the graphene. All insets included in SEM pictures are the corresponding digital images of the conducting films built on graphene, doped graphene, and their hybrid with Ag NWs. The optical images show almost similar optical transparency, indicating that the conductor is not significantly affected by chemical doping or hybridization with Ag NWs. Fig. 1e displays the digital image of the hybrid conducting film of Ag NWs and dual-doped graphene constructed on plastic substrate (PET), exhibiting good flexibility and high optical transmittance. Fig. 2 shows the spectroscopic information of the pristine and doped graphene samples at various stages of p-type doping with nitric acid. In the XPS experiment, the nitrogen 1s signal \u2013 which was not present in the pristine graphene \u2013 was detected after doping. We deconvoluted the N 1s signals in the doped graphene samples through Gaussian fitting, and found three peaks. After bottom-doping, the peaks were observed at 406.2, 401.2, and 399.3 eV, corresponding to NOx, N-H (or pyrrolic), and C-N (pyridinic) bondings, respectively. It is believed that the dopant is chemically influencing the graphene, because the N 1s peak not only occurred for NOx bonding, but also for the other chemical bondings (such as pyrrolic and pyridinic bondings) . This observation indicates that HNO3 chemically dopes the graphene with NO2 as well as N atoms . The samples dual-doped with HNO3 for both bottom and top sides showed same peaks at 406.2, 401.1, and 399.2 eV. The doping effect was stronger after dual-doping compared to the single-doped state, based. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "on the comparison of the ratio of CN signal to NOx signal in each state. Raman analysis further confirmed the dual-doping effects of graphene by displaying peak shifts in the spectra (Fig. 2b). The G peak and the 2D peak shifted after bottom-doping and dual-doping, clearly showing that HNO3-doped graphene films have blue shift for both G and 2D peaks. D-band peaks were not observed at any stage of doping, indicating that HNO3 treatment was not destructive to the chemical bonds of graphene. The peak position of G band shifts upon doping . An upward shift in the G band position is due to the phonon stiffening effect by charge extraction of p-type doping . The G band (1592 cm\u22121) in the pristine graphene shifted by 3 cm\u22121 from 1592 to 1595 cm\u22121 after HNO3 bottom-doping. The G band in pristine graphene shifted by 11 cm\u22121 from 1592 to 1603 cm\u22121 after dual-doping. Such an additional peak shift of the Raman peak in the dual-doped graphene comes from an augmented doping effect by top- and bottom-side dual-doping . The Raman shift in the 2D peak from 2634 to 2657 cm\u22121 is attributed to the doping of nitrogen atoms, consistent with the XPS result . Fig. 3 displays the electrical and optical properties of as-formed doped graphene at different doping conditions. Electrical properties of doped graphene were measured for its R s, while the optical properties were measured for the optical transmittance of graphene on a PET substrate. We investigated the electrical properties of various conductors by comparing their doping efficiencies (conductivity enhancement, \u0394R s/R s,0), which was defined as the ratio of the change of sheet resistance after doping (\u0394R s) to the original resistance (R s,0). When the graphene was single-doped with HNO3, the R s first dropped from 1.17 k\u03a9/sq. in the pristine state to 456 \u03a9/sq. in the doping concentration of 1 M (Fig. 3a). The R s was steady at \u223c460 \u03a9/sq. up to 5 M, and then increased to 29 k\u03a9/sq. under 10 M of HNO3. Dual-doping with identical dopants (i.e., HNO3) for both top and bottom doping resulted in much lower R s of 189 \u03a9/sq. under optimal conditions. We also tried asymmetric doping of graphene, with HNO3 as the bottom dopant and gold (Au) as the top dopant. The R s of asymmetrically dual-doped graphene (HNO3/Au) \u2013 where the lowest R s was achieved at 1 M AuCl3 doping \u2013 was slightly larger than that of the symmetric dual-doping (i.e., doping both sides with HNO3). Such an asymmetrical dual-doping of organic/inorganic dopants suggests that our system can be further extended to different dual-doping systems by judicious selection of various dopant combinations . Note that, we also compared the effect of multiple single side-doping with that of dual-doping on the electrical property of graphene with same dopant (HNO3) (Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. S3, the doping efficiency (conductivity enhancement) of graphene is not significantly improved by multiple times single-side doping. In addition, the doping efficiency of dual-doping (84%) exceeds that of single-side doping (max. 65.7%) prepared at all different treatments. The optical transmittance (including PET substrate) of the bottom-doped graphene peaked to be 90.8% at 0.5 M solution doping, and was higher than 90.5% throughout the whole range studied, except for 10 M doping (Fig. 3b). In the case of graphene samples with dual symmetric doping, the highest was 90.6% at 1 M solution doping. The samples with asymmetric doping had transmittances of 90.4\u201390.6%. Note that the optimum doping condition was obtained at 1 M HNO3, where the lowest R s was achieved while maintaining a relatively high transmittance. Asymmetrically dual-doped graphene (HNO3/Au) retained its high optical transmittance (90.4%), which is a little bit lower than that of HNO3 dual-doped graphene. Fig. 4 compares the R s and optical transmittance of doped graphene prepared by various combinations of p-type (HNO3) and n-type (N2H4) doping systems. Interestingly, p-type doping generally resulted in lower R s, whereas the resistance increased after n-type doping (Fig. 4a). Compared to pristine graphene with a typical R s of 0.8\u20131.1 k\u03a9/sq., the resistance values after bottom-doping changed to 0.35\u20130.39 k\u03a9/sq. and 5.6\u20136.7 k\u03a9/sq. for p-type and n-type dopants, respectively. Dual-doping exhibited a resistance change according to the type of additional doping. It shows that p/p-doped graphene has the lowest R s compared with the other systems, indicating the effectiveness of p/p-type dual-doping. A significant reduction in R s after p-type doping was also observed when the graphene was treated by bottom n-type doping followed by top p-type doping. The sample with n/p-type dopants for bottom/top doping had an R s of 1.19 k\u03a9/sq., which is almost less than a fifth of the resistance (6.7 k\u03a9/sq.) of n-type bottom-doped graphene. On the other hand, n-top-doping after p-bottom-doping increased the resistance from 0.35 to 1.16 k\u03a9/sq. The optical transmittance of the dual-doped graphene samples was in the range of 90.4\u201390.7%. It was noticeable that the homogeneously dual-doped graphene samples showed almost identical transmittance compared with the pristine and single-doped graphenes. The high efficiency of p/p-type dual-doping of graphene with HNO3 can be attributed to the effectively designed bandgap engineering. It is well known that band structure engineering of graphene is an effective way to modify the electronic properties of graphene, because pristine graphene has zero bandgap . Typically, the band structure of graphene can be engineered through various dopings. In this context, the doping of graphene plays an important role in increasing carrier density as well as in changing the electronic structure. Accordingly, we designed the doping of graphene with optimal band structure with a p-type dopant. As shown in a comparative doping test based on HNO3 and N2H4 (Fig. 4), p-type dual-doping was the most effective way to enhance the conductivity of the graphene films, because the work function of graphene could be shifted to the p-type side, thereby enhancing the conductivity of the graphene . The doping of graphene is effective not only because of the zero bandgap but. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "also the Dirac cone. The low density of states close to the Fermi level of graphene can be very efficiently filled/emptied by dopants. Fig. 5 compares the R s and optical transmittance of Ag NW/graphene hybrid films obtained by p/p-type dual-doped or un-doped graphene. After applying the same amount of Ag NWs above the percolation limit of their network on both graphene films, the R s of the pristine graphene and the p/p-type dual-doped graphene decreased from 0.86 to 0.78 k\u03a9/sq. and from 0.32 to 0.29 k\u03a9/sq., respectively. The R s value of Ag NW network on the un-doped graphene is estimated based on the equation for the parallel combination of two resistors (1/R s,undoped-Gr + 1/R s,AgNW = 1/R s,hybrid, where R s,undoped-Gr = 0.86 k\u03a9/sq. and R s,hybrid = 0.78 k\u03a9/sq.), and the calculated R s of Ag NW network (R s,AgNW) on the pristine graphene hybrid film is 8.39 k\u03a9/sq. However, the R s of the p/p-type dual-doped graphene hybrid film fabricated with the same amount of the Ag NWs on the pristine graphene is less than R s of the parallel combination of p/p-doped graphene (R s,doped-Gr) and the Ag NW network (R s,AgNW). The R s of the p/p-type doped graphene and Ag NW hybrid film is 0.29 k\u03a9/sq., while the R s of the parallel combination of the p/p-doped graphene and Ag NW network is 0.31 k\u03a9/sq. (1/R s,doped-Gr + 1/Rs,AgNW = 1/R s,hybrid, where R s,doped-Gr = 0.32 k\u03a9/sq. and R s,AgNW = 8.39 k\u03a9/sq.). Obviously, the Ag NWs do not affect the doping state of graphene as presented in the Raman spectra of the Ag NW/p-type dual-doped graphene, which show no significant shift (Fig. S1). Instead, we believe that the contact resistance between the graphene and the Ag NWs (R C,Gr-Ag in Fig. 5c) decreases because of the enhanced conductivity of the p/p-doped graphene, resulting in further reduction of the R s of the doped-graphene and Ag NW hybrid film through the co-percolating conduction . In the co-percolating network, Ag NW can be a bypass of electron transport at the grain boundaries of the CVD grown polycrystalline graphene, as shown in Fig. 5c . In addition, consistent with the results in the dual-doped graphene (Fig. 4a), the hybrid film of Ag NW and p/p-type dual-doped graphene exhibits the lowest R s compared to other types of dopant combinations (p/p, p/n, and n/p) in hybrid films (Fig. S2), indicating the retained effectiveness of p/p-type dual-doping in hybrid system . Fig. 5b displays the optical transmittance of conductive films prepared at doped/un-doped and hybrid conditions, exhibiting good retention of the optical properties of p-type dual-doped hybrid films, comparable to hybrid of Ag NW and bare graphene. In addition, although the optical transmittance of a hybrid conductor slightly decreases (less than 0.5%) after Ag NW hybridization, we believe the hybrid conductor of graphene/Ag NW is still valid approach because additional dose of Ag NWs can further decrease the resistance of conductor without significant decrease of optical transmittance . It is hard to directly compare the results of individual work prepared and tested by various conditions. Nevertheless, it is still meaningful to see where we stand in terms of electrical and optical parameters. Our conducting electrodes provide with comparable conductivity to the best records of previously reported similar works while out-perform in optical properties (See Table S1 in Supplementary Information) . Although some previous works show superior conductance of graphene to that of our dual-doped graphene, our approach exhibits the lowest R s (188 \u03a9/sq.) under the condition of high transmittance (97.4%; 90.6% including PET substrate), and higher doping efficiency (\u223c84%) at monolayer-level graphene. The hybrids of doped graphene and Ag NWs also show enhanced conducting properties and high optical transparency compared with reported results, indicating that our method is a valid approach to enhancing conductivity without compromising optical transmittance.  In this work, we have demonstrated Ag NW/dual-doped graphene hybrids with enhanced conductivity, where the top and bottom sides of the graphene were doped with p-type dopants (HNO3) to engineer effective work function of the dual-doped graphene. In addition, such p-type dual-doped graphene and its hybrids were found as the most effective to enhance conductivity based on systematic and comparative investigation of the doping effect on the graphene and graphene/Ag NW hybrid films. Compared with the current state-of-the-art in Ag NW and graphene hybrids, this work made several breakthroughs, summarized as follows. Novel dual co-doping method to improve doping efficiency (conductivity enhancement): Our novel dual-doping method based on top and bottom co-doping of graphene was quite effective to enhance the doping efficiency of monolayer graphene based conductor (R s: 188 \u03a9/sq.) by 84% compared to pristine graphene, without debilitation of its original optical transmittance (dual-doped graphene: 97.4%, pristine graphene: 97.5%). Optimized dual co-doping system: Under the varied combinations of dopant types for dual-doping (p/p, p/n, n/p, and n/n) with HNO3 for p-doping and N2H4 for n-doping, we found that the p/p-type dual-doping among other combinations was the most effective in improving the electrical property of graphene and its hybrid with Ag NWs. Enhanced conductivity of Ag NW networks on doped-graphene hybrids: The hybrid conductor of Ag NWs on dual-doped graphene exhibits improved electrical conductivity (62% reduction of sheet resistance) and somewhat retained optical transparency (Ag NW/dual-doped graphene hybrid: 90.1% including substrate) compared with Ag NW/native graphene hybrid (90.3% including substrate) because of further resistance reduction through the co-percolating conduction. Current result indicates that our novel hybrid conductor of Ag NW/dual-doped graphene perform comparably to most of the reported works in conductivity, and out-perform in optical properties. We believe that our facile doping and hybridization approach can open a new direction to high-performance transparent conducting electrodes for flexible displays, solar cells, and wearable electronic devices fitted on a curved substrate.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

TiO2 NPs under ultraviolet radiation generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) which can be used as a photocatalytic disinfectant. TiO2 photocatalyst have the capacity to damage the cancer cells [4\u20137], other than bacteria, viruses and algae [8\u201310,11\u201317] under UV illumination. Shokoh Parham et al., [18] reported that their higher anti-bacterial and anti-cancer activity were due to their excessive ROS generation mechanism. According to Jin C et al. [19], the anatase TiO2 NPs can produce more ROS than the rutile phase, and this was demonstrated by various researchers using X-ray absorption fine structure spectrometry (XAFS). The biological activities of TiO2 NPs increase with the doped and modified chemical agents. But they are found to be more toxic and expensive. To reduce the toxic nature and cost, plant materials can be used as modifiers. Plants are found abundance in the environment and they have been used from ancient time in many medicinal systems such as Siddha, Ayurvedha etc. to cure many diseases. From the literature, it is reviewed that rose petals [20,21] and proteins [22,23] tend to destroy bacterial and cancer cells. Among them, Aqua Rosa and protein powder are found to exhibit excellent biological activities. Hence, modified TiO2 NPs have been prepared using Aqua Rosa and protein powder to enhance the antibacterial and anticancer activities. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an excellent photocatalyst [27\u201329] having large band gap of 3.2 eV. They are used in optoelectronic devices [30\u201332] and dye\u2013sensitized solar cells [33\u201335]. They play an important part in the bacterial growth inhibition by their production of ROS in the presence of UV light [24\u201325]. They serve as an excellent antibacterial agent [26]. TiO2 has been increasingly used for its better biocompatibility and photocatalytic property [36\u201337]. Reactive Oxygen Species formed during the reduction of oxygen was found to be the most important step in many photocatalytic reactions. This is clearly true with the case of TiO2 nanoparticles. The antibacterial and photocatalytic activities of TiO2 nanoparticles have been attributed to their ability to produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [38\u201340]. High surface area of TiO2 nanoparticles accommodates more number of microbes which is in contact with the nanoparticles and this results in the death of the cell wall. The positive charge of the TiO2 nanoparticles attracts the negatively charged cell membrane and so more number of nanoparticles are able to penetrate quickly and attack the cell wall. This in turn damages the cell wall and results in the cell death. The modification of bio agents on TiO2 surface can also greatly increase the amount of ROS production which results in the enhanced photocatalytic and biological activity [41]. Due to their tendency to generate excessive reactive oxygen species in cancer cells, they also serve as an efficient anticancer agent [42\u201343]. Chakra et al., [44] synthesized the ZnO and TiO2 nanocomposites and then the synthesized nanocomposites were subjected to Gram positive bacteria such as S. aureus and Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli. The ZnO has lower antibacterial action than TiO2 but when combined increases the action when compared with ZnO nanoparticles. Agarwal et al. [45] and Eikani et al. [46] studied the chemical composition of Rosa damascena (Aqua Rosa) and observed that phenethyl alcohol (81.27%), geraniol (4.43%) and \u03b2-citronellol (5.72%) were the main constituents. Mahmoodreza Moein et al. [47] observed that Rosa damascena comprises of other components such as linalool, m-thymol, eugenol, methyl eugenol, curzerene, myristicin, dibutyl phthalate, nonane, \u03b1-pinene, m-cymene, benzyl alcohol, \u03b3-terpinene, \u03b1-terpineol, carvacrol, trans-caryophyllene, eugenol acetate, heptadecane, nonadecane, docosane in addition to the three main components. Aqua Rosa is used as a remedial measure for various intestinal problems [48], acne [49] and bacterial infections [50]. According to Si et al. [51], the geraniol exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. typhimurium among sixty-six essential oils. Zanetti et al. [52] reported that geraniol showed good antibacterial nature when compared with Cinnamic acid. Protein powder comprises of soy protein isolate (82.26%), wheat protein (10.0%) and pea protein (7.50%). Isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and histidine are the essential amino acids present in the protein powder. Isoleucine and leucine combined peptide shows anticancer activity against MCF-7 cells, and it is reported by Che Wang [53]. Soy protein isolates exhibits antimicrobial activity, and it is observed by many researchers [54\u201356]. Fig. 1 represents the chemical structure of geraniol, phenyl ethyl alcohol, \u03b2-damascenone, \u03b2-citronellol and soy protein isolate. For Biological applications, TiO2 NPs are synthesized by various methods such as sol-gel [57], coprecipitation [58], hydrothermal [59], sonication and spray pyrolysis [3], DC reactive magnetron sputtering [60], but hydrothermal technique is a conventional method under which pressure and temperature can be maintained for the preparation of inorganic materials in a nanocrystalline form which is reported by Byrappa K [61]. In the present work, Pure TiO2, Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 and Protein powder modified TiO2 were synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis, and then the obtained nanoparticles were subjected to characterizations such as XRD (X-Ray diffraction), UV\u2013Vis (UV\u2013Vis Spectrophotometer), FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed spectrometer), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), MTT assay and Agar diffusion method. The Pure and Surface-modified samples showed excellent antibacterial and anticancer activity.  Titanium tetra-isopropoxide and isopropanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals. Fresh Aqua Rosa (Rose Petals) and Protein powder were purchased from the market. Titanium (IV) tetra-isopropoxide, Isopropanol and water were mixed separately and stirred for 120\u202fmin at room temperature for 2\u202fh. Consequently, a sol was obtained. The sol was transferred to the Teflon autoclave and then heated for 2\u202fh at 200\u202f\u00b0C. The obtained products were centrifuged and then annealed at the temperature of about 350\u202f\u00b0C to remove impurities. 10\u202fg of Protein powder was added with 100\u202fml of distilled water and boiled for about 30\u202fmin. It was filtered using Whatman paper and the extract thus obtained was named as Protein extract. Similarly Rose petals were boiled with distilled water to obtain Aqua Rosa extract. About 4\u202fml of Aqua Rosa extract and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "4\u202fml of the protein extract separately was added to 0.2\u202fg of TiO2 powder and stirred with 20\u202fml of deionised water for about 2\u202fh. Then it was subjected to centrifuging process and later on dried in oven to get the Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 NPs and Protein modified TiO2 NPs respectively. XPERT-PRO diffractometer with \u03bb\u202f=\u202f1.5406 A\u00b0 and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Model JEOL 3010, 300\u202fkV) was used for structural analysis and particle size analysis. UV\u2013Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer was used for optical analysis. Functional analyses of the samples were determined using Perkin Elmer Infrared spectrometer. The antibacterial and anticancer studies were subjected to Agar diffusion technique against bacterial Strains and MTT assay on KB Oral cancer cells.  Fig. 2 showed the X-ray diffraction patterns for Pure TiO2, Aqua Rosa modified and Protein modified Titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibited peaks at 25.3\u00b0, 37.8\u00b0, 48\u00b0, 54.7\u00b0, 63\u00b0, 70\u00b0 and 75.7\u00b0 that denoted the crystal planes (1 0 1), (0 0 4), (2 0 0), (1 0 5), (2 0 4), (2 2 0) and (2 1 5), respectively. These peaks are matched with the peaks of anatase TiO2 which is found to agree with the JCPDS file No: 21-1272. Ba-abbad M et al. [62] explained that the intense peak at 25.4\u00b0 corresponding to (1 0 1) plane was anatase in nature. Xiuzhen Wei et al. [63] synthesized highly pure TiO2 NPs using improved sol-hydrothermal method and the obtained phase was confirmed to be anatase. Roshan Nainani et al. [64] obtained 7\u202fnm Ag-doped TiO2 NPs by photo deposition technique which was confirmed to be anatase phase. Fig. 3 shows the expanded X-ray diffraction pattern for pure and modified samples. A small peak at 30.7\u00b0 is observed for the pure sample, which is assigned to (2 1 1) plane of the brookite phase of TiO2. El-Sherbiny S [65] discussed the synthesis procedure of TiO2 with hydrothermal technology. He reported that the peak at 30.76\u00b0 could be assigned to the brookite phase which is in agreement with the experimental results. The diffraction peak (2 1 1) that corresponds to the brookite phase is seen in the Pure TiO2 nanoparticles. This diffraction peak decreases when modified with Aqua Rosa. The peak corresponding to the brookite phase vanishes when Protein powder is modified with pure TiO2 samples. The Aqua Rosa and Protein powder modifiers when modified with the Pure TiO2 nanoparticles, causes disturbances which in turn arose some defects in the system. This nature leads to the decrease in the crystalline nature of the material and hence the intensity of the (1 0 1) peak decreases which is shown in the diagram. The optical spectra of the synthesized samples are recorded with UV\u2013Vis Spectrophotometer. Fig. 4 shows the absorbance of the Pure, Protein modified, and Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 NPs. The maximum absorbances are observed at 264, 254 and 248\u202fnm for Pure, Protein modified, and Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 samples respectively. Blue shift is observed for the modified samples which indicated that the particle size of the surface-modified NPs decreases with the Pure TiO2 samples. The modification of Aqua Rosa and Protein powder produces discrete energy levels. This increases the energy gap and it requires higher energy for the electrons to excite from valence band to conduction band which causes blue shift due to the quantum confinement of the material. This decrease in the particle size due to the blue shift is studied by Elham Gharibshahi [66], who observed that the platinum nanoparticles exhibited two absorption spectra at 216 and 264\u202fnm. Rathod P B et al. [67] also observed the maximum absorbance for TiO2 NPs lies between 220 and 320\u202fnm. He explained that the transition of electrons from the valence O 2p to the excited conduction Ti 3d band is responsible for the blue shift. Fig. 5 showed the TEM and HRTEM images of the synthesized pure and bio-modified samples. The modified Titanium dioxide NPs are found to be agglomerated. The Protein modified nanoparticles are more agglomerated when compared with the Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The average particle sizes of the synthesized pure and modified TiO2 NPs are calculated using a bar diagram as seen in the Fig. 6 . The average particle size of the Pure, Protein modified and Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 nanoparticles are found to be 7.5\u202fnm, 6.5\u202fnm and 5.5\u202fnm respectively. The TEM analysis revealed that Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 nanoparticles are smaller in size when compared with the pure samples which agree with the XRD results. Diffraction fringes are observed for the pure samples in the HRTEM analysis diagram. The HRTEM image clearly confirms the good crystallinity of the pure TiO2 samples. The d spacing for the pure TiO2 NPs are found to be 0.352\u202fnm. This d spacing matches with the XRD analysis for the sharp peak at 2\u03b8\u202f=\u202f25.3\u00b0 that corresponds to the (1 0 1) plane. Fig. 7 shows the FTIR spectra of pure Titanium dioxide nanoparticles, Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 and Protein powder modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The broad peak at 633\u202fcm\u22121 denotes the O-Ti-O vibration bands [68]. The peaks at 1633 and 3420\u202fcm\u22121 are designated to the vibrations of hydroxyl groups. In the Aqua Rosa modified TiO2, the peak at 1444\u202fcm\u22121 could be assigned to strong bending vibrations of C C and the peak at 1113\u202fcm\u22121 is designated to C O stretching vibrations of geraniol, a primary constituent of Aqua Rosa. Zahra Hadian et al. [69] in his work used beta-cyclodextrin-geraniol complex for drug delivery applications. He showed that the peaks at 1444 and 1001\u202fcm\u22121 were responsible for the C C bending and C O stretching vibrations respectively which exactly matches with the experimental results. In the FTIR spectra of Protein-modified TiO2, the peaks at 3365\u202fcm\u22121 (-OH stretching vibration of amine), 2895\u202fcm\u22121 (CH stretching vibration of amines), 1634\u202fcm\u22121 (C O stretching vibration of the amide), 1393\u202fcm\u22121 (C N stretching vibration of the amide) and 1068\u202fcm\u22121 (C O stretching vibration of amine) are observed. Zardini H Z et al. [56] reported the antibacterial activity of the multi-walled carbon nano tube. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "combined with arginine and lysine for the first time in the literature. He observed the peaks at 3363, 2851, 1679, 1330 and 1142\u202fcm\u22121 in the spectra as -OH, -CH, -CO (amide), -CN (amide) and -CO stretching vibrations of the lysine respectively which is in agreement with the experimental findings. The peak at 1633\u202fcm\u22121 present in the pure TiO2 NPs are shifted to 1634\u202fcm\u22121 in the Protein modified NPs which may be due to the presence of lysine in the Protein powder and titanium carboxylate present in the TiO2 samples. It is also observed that 1634\u202fcm\u22121 peak broadening in the Protein powder modified NPs becomes weaker when compared with the pure TiO2 sample spectra. Fig. 8 showed the anti-cancer effect of Pure, Aqua Rosa modified, and Protein powder modified TiO2 nanoparticles against KB oral cancer cell line. The samples revealed the anti-cancerous nature against the KB oral cancer cells. The sample showed dose-dependent anti-cancer activity. The surface modified samples showed the enhanced anticancer activity of TiO2 NPs as there is an increase in the concentration of the dopants. For the concentration of 50\u202f\u03bcg/ml of the samples, the cell viability was observed to be 50.67%, 38.48% and 14.09% for Pure, Aqua Rosa modified, and Protein powder modified TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. Among the modified samples Protein modified Nanoparticles showed excellent anti-cancer activities when compared to pure and other modified samples. The generation of reactive oxygen species is one of the important toxicity mechanisms. It damages cell membranes, cellular organelles and nucleic acids present in the DNA and RNA. Radicals, when formed in excess, can damage a greater number of macromolecules. Since, they are unpaired electrons, they are highly reactive and can damage a greater number of macromolecules that includes lipids and protein. More number of nanoparticles can easily penetrate into the cell membrane causing cell death or apoptosis. There are a greater number of amino acids in the protein powder and among them lysine and leucine is responsible for the damages to the cancer cells. The amino acids present in protein powder may increase the anti-cancer nature in comparison with the pure Titanium dioxide NPs. Leucine, lysine and valine present in the sample are found to be responsible for the destruction of cancer cells. Che Wang et al. [53] observed that lysine and leucine combined peptide popularly known as L-K 6 was able to show anti-cancerous nature against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Kim SE et al. [23] discussed that a peptide from soy protein was able to suppress the cancer cells by stopping the functioning of the cell at the interphase, particularly at G2 Phase. Azuma et al. [70] and Kanamoto et al. [71] confirmed that the soy proteins were able to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Srinivas J. Rayaprolu et al. [72] investigated the anticancer activity of soy protein peptide against CCRF-CEM (blood cancer cell line), MCF-7 (Breast cancer cell line) and PC-3 (Prostate cancer cell line). He also observed that the peptides are able to suppress the cancer cell line about 68% and IC 50 value falls between 608 and 678\u202f\u03bcg/ml. The presence of geraniol in the Aqua Rosa may be responsible for the anti-cancer nature of the Aqua Rosa modified TiO2. Burke et al. [73] reported that geraniol, the main constituent present in rose water is responsible for the anti-cancer activity. Mohaddese Mahboubi et al. [74] in his research findings revealed that the citronellol and geraniol present in R. damascena were responsible for all the pharmacological activities. Amir Zamiri-Akhlaghi [75] studied that R. damascena decreased the cell viability and this behavior depends on the amount of the sample and time interval on human cervix cancer cell line - HeLa. The half maximal inhibitory concentration is observed to be 2135\u202f\u03bcg/ml for 24\u202fh. Zu et al. [76] recorded the anticancer activity of R. damascena against A-549 and MCF-7 cancer cells. Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shows the inverted microscopic images of Pure and modified Titanium dioxide nanoparticles of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50\u202f\u03bcg/ml concentrations respectively. Fig. 14 showed the mechanism of anticancer activity. Fig. 15 shows the antibacterial activities for Pure, Protein modified and Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 nanoparticles against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive), Streptococcus mutans (Gram positive), Escherichia coli (Gram negative), Klebsiella pneumoniae(Gram negative) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram negative). It is observed that inhibition zone is maximum for Protein modified TiO2 NPs against all bacterial Strains. No activity is seen for Pure and Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 nanoparticles for Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane which comprises of lipopolysaccharides. This membrane does not allow the Pure and Aqua Rosa modified nanoparticles to penetrate inside the bacterial Strains and hence no activity is observed for the samples against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. Koohsari et al. [77] discussed the anti-bacterial activity of selected native plants of Iran. He observed that the Gram-positive bacteria were highly sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria which agreed with the experimental findings. For K. pneumoniae, maximum inhibition zone is observed for Protein modified and no activity is observed for Pure and Aqua Rosa modified samples. Maximum zone of inhibition is seen for Protein modified and minimum inhibition zone is observed for the Pure TiO2 sample against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. The Pure and Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 suppressed the growth of bacteria against Gram-positive bacteria. Zanetti M et al. [52] studied the antibacterial nature of geraniol and cinnamic acid and observed that geraniol, the primary constituent of Aqua Rosa showed excellent anti-bacterial activity than cinnamic acid against S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, E. coli and S. enterica using Agar diffusion method. According to Si et al. [51], geraniol showed more activity against E. coli and S. typhimurium species when compared with 66 types of essential oils. Andogan et al. [78] and Gochev V et al. [79] also discussed the antibacterial nature of citronellol, geraniol and nerol which form the major constituents of rose oil. Hirulkar N B et al. [80] observed that the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of rose petal. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "extracts exhibited better antibacterial activity than the petroleum ether extract. The Protein modified TiO2 samples showed excellent activity against all the five bacterial Strains and maximum is against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and S. mutans. The antibacterial activity of the Protein modified samples may be due to the amino acids present in the soy protein isolate. Yuanyuan Liu et al. [54] studied the soy protein isolate film with Nisin, Sodium lactate and EDTA and evaluated their antimicrobial activity against three food pathogenic bacteria. Kim et al. [55], reported that soy protein isolates films incorporated with cinnamaldehyde inhibited the growth of E. coli, S. typhymurium, B. cereus and E. sakazakii microorganisms. Park et al. [81], Zhao et al. [82] and Ko et al. [83] showed anti-microbial nature when soy protein isolate is combined with natural agents. Hadi Zare Zardini et al. [56] studied the anti-microbial activity of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes with the addition of arginine, lysine and pristine amino acids by precipitation technique. The addition of amino acids enhanced the anti-bacterial nature further. He observed that the anti-bacterial activity is effective against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. He also concluded from his experimental report that MWCNT doped with arginine, lysine and pristine acts as a positive charge and bacterial Strains act as negative charge and hence there is a kind of attraction, which leads to the increase in the anti-bacterial activity of the doped MWCNT. High toxicity and particle size reduction are some of the factors that will increase the anti-bacterial activity. Smaller size nanoparticles generate more amounts of ROS which is found to be more toxic and in turn it increases the anti-bacterial activity. Similar observation was reported by Carlson et al. and Liu et al. [84\u201385]. Carlson et al. [84] showed that the 15\u202fnm Silver NPs produce more ROS than 55\u202fnm NPs. Liu et al. [85] also observed that 5\u202fnm Silver NPs produce more toxic nature when compared with 20 and 50\u202fnm particles. Osamu Yamamoto [86] observed that the reduction in the particle size of the zinc oxide nanoparticles increases the antibacterial activity of the nanoparticles. He did his experiment by varying the size of the zinc oxide powder from 0.1 to 0.8\u202f\u03bcm. The surface area is found to be 26 m2\u202fg\u22121 for 0.1\u202f\u03bcm and 0.85\u202fm2\u202fg\u22121 for 0.8\u202f\u03bcm. The specific surface area of the particles increases as the size of the particle decreases. He reported that the generation of hydrogen peroxide destroys the bacterial cells effectively. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide increases with the decrease in the particle size since the number of ZnO particles per unit volume increases with a decrease in the particle size. Smaller size nanomaterials can easily penetrate the bacterial cell wall. So, 6.5\u202fnm Protein powder modified TiO2 nanoparticles produces more Reactive Oxygen species (ROS) and they have the tendency to damage the bacterial cell wall easily by penetrating inside the cell wall and enhance the antibacterial nature further when compared with 7.5\u202fnm TiO2 NPs. The biomolecules present in the protein powder also plays an important role in the enhancement of the biological activity further along with their smaller particle size. Among the modified samples Protein modified Nanoparticles showed excellent antibacterial activities when compared with pure and other modified samples. The generation of reactive oxygen species is one of the important toxicity mechanisms. It damages cell membranes, cellular organelles and nucleic acids present in the DNA and RNA. Radicals when formed in excess, can damage a greater number of macromolecules. Since they are unpaired electrons, they are highly reactive and can damage a greater number of macromolecules that includes lipids and protein. More number of nanoparticles can easily penetrate in to the cell membrane causing ultimate bacterial cell death. The positive charged surface modified nanoparticles and the negative charged cell membrane due to electrostatic force of attractions combine and can easily penetrate in to the cell membrane. There are a greater number of amino acids in the protein powder and among them lysine, leucine is responsible for the damages to the cancer cells. The amino acids present in protein powder may increase the anti-bacterial nature in comparison with the pure Titanium dioxide NPs. The anti-cancer and anti-bacterial properties of the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles are compared with the previous reported literature in the Table 1 .  The biological activities of the Pure, Aqua Rosa modified, and Protein modified TiO2 NPs are studied. The research experiments confirmed that the dopants added to the TiO2 NPs have increased the antibacterial and anticancer activities. The inhibitory bacterial zones are found to be maximum for Protein powder modified TiO2 samples when compared with the pure TiO2 samples against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial Strains. The Protein powder modified TiO2 NPs exhibited minimum cell viability among the cancer cells at 50\u202f\u03bcg/ml concentration of the sample. So, the research experiments concluded that Protein modified TiO2 NPs are excellent nanoparticles for the biological applications particularly anti-bacterial and anti-cancer activities when compared with Pure and Aqua Rosa modified TiO2 NPs.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.applthermaleng.2020.116201.txt", "paper": ["The semiconductors are extensively utilized at numerous applications such as cloud computing of massive data amount, high-performance CPU components, concentrator photovoltaic cells (CPV), and any mobile micro electric devices. The electronic apparatuses are sources of significant heat which require to be thermally-managed properly. Meanwhile, it was stated that the operation and performance of semiconductors are susceptible to temperature [1]. Furthermore, under high operating temperatures, physical damage could occur as a result of thermal stresses that threaten the components\u2019 safety and decrease their lifespan. Moreover, pressing demand for more tightly-packed electronic devices faces a severe challenge of overcoming the major limiting factor of high heat fluxes in very constrained areas. So, thermal management schemes are a must as devices attain higher heat densities. For instance, it is expected by 2026 that electronic computer chips would generate average heat flux up to 450\u00a0W/cm2 with local hot spots of 1.2 \u2013 4.5\u00a0kW/cm2 [2]. Therefore, the heat removal of a robust quantity of generated heat in very compact areas is a severer and more essential aspect for thermal management of all the continuous intelligence functions in the electronics industry. One of the state-of-the-art semiconductors technology is multi-junction solar cells (MJSCs), which are intended to generate more electricity per unit area than the typical silicon PV solar cells [3]. The MJSCs are deployed within the high concentrator photovoltaic (HCPV) densely packed arrangements. Using the MJSCs is more appropriate than the conventional silicon for HCPV arrangements because of their high electrical efficiency, tiny size, and reasonable cost [4,5]. The current noteworthy accomplishment of the MJSCs has been stated as an electrical efficiency reached up to 46% [6]. A major part (\u2248 60%) of the absorbed solar irradiance by MJSCs is transformed into heat, and high heat densities drive to a high cell temperature that harmfully affects the overall performance [7]. The occurrence of high cell temperature and hot spots initiates high degradation in the cell structure according to high thermal loads [8]. HCPV systems are a promising technology that captured many researchers attention in the solar energy field, besides HCPV would be a competitive technology in many countries for electricity generation [9]. Several studies have been performed regarding the impact of cell temperature on the solar cell performance [8]. Lv et al. [10] evaluated the temperature variation over MJSCs under concentration ratio (CR)\u00a0equals 576 suns. They proved the harmful impact of high cell temperature on the electrical performance of MJSCs. These results match with Siefer and Bett\u2019s data [11]. Landis et al. [12] also stated the temperature effect on MJ solar cells under low solar concentration ratios and low-temperature degrees. Moreover, commercial MJSCs have been examined under a high temperature of 400\u00a0\u00b0C, presenting a minor difference from a linear performance. Nishioka et al. [13] disclosed a novel function for the MJSCs electrical efficiency and the temperature coefficient. The authors described the efficiency declination percent per 1\u00a0K temperature rise about 0.248% and 0.098% at CR of 1 sun and 200 suns, respectively. Hence, an efficient thermal management technique is mandatory for MJSCs to boost their performance. Furthermore, reasonable uniformity of wall temperature, which defines as the difference between maximum and minimum local temperatures over the cell top wall (\u0394T = Tmax \u2212 Tmin), and low friction loss are the main aspects for extending the lifespan of HCPV systems. During the last decade, substantial attention has been given to thermal management of HCPV systems, so extensive research studies [14,15] have been conducted concerning the heat removal using several cooling schemes to remove the high amount of heat produced in such these systems. Aggressive cooling systems were employed concerning the impact of operating temperature on the system performance for long-term exploration in severe environments of the heat to be cooled efficiently and effectively. Thus far, a number of technologies, active and passive, have been established for thermal management of such compact and tiny devices as the main two possible methods for removing heat. The ongoing progress toward more densely packed solar modules requires superior thermal dissipation than that provided by passive cooling. Active cooling technique is more reliable, functional, and economically reasonable compared to passive cooling technique under higher power densities. One of the most frequently used active cooling systems is channel cooling schemes [16]. The microchannel heat sink (MCHS) has a great potential for attaining very high heat transfer rates compared to conventional mini channel heat sinks because of its high surface area to volume ratio [17]. Many considerations influence the MCHS cooling performance, such as channel geometry design, surface roughness, fluid thermo-physical properties, flow phase, etc. [18]. MCHS has merit as a cooling device because of its smaller geometry size and low coolant flow requirements. Significant efforts are directed toward improving the cooling performance of MCHS, regarding heat transfer, working fluid phase, effects of fluid property modification, and dimensional optimization [19]. Furthermore, extensive experimental and mathematical studies [20,21] have been comprehensively investigated using single-phase liquid flow in MCHS as a cooling device for heat dissipation from CPV systems. It is confirmed that single-phase flow MCHS able to attain a uniform cooling over high heat sources. Moreover, numerous types of MCHS commercials are available, for instance, wavy fin microchannel, pin or fin microchannel, oblique fin microchannel, single-layer or double-layer microchannel, etc. Jakhar et al. [22] determined that heat sink design plays an important role and should be practical, applicable, and efficient during operation. Active cooling approach is more functional and economically reasonable [23]. Gilmore et al. [16] presented an extensive review of the recent research reports regarding active cooling schemes for HCPV generally. The authors reported that single-phase MCHS is a reliable approach for dissipating high heat densities generated from HCPVs. Naqiuddin et al. [18] briefed many research works concerning to MCHS geometrical designs for dense power systems. Their summary stated that geometry design of MCHS is considered as a key factor which extremely impacts the thermal management of the HCPV systems. Concerning HCPV systems explicitly, Di Capua H et al. [24] numerically modeled a specific MCHS with. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "a detailed geometry for HCPV thermal management under CR of 1000 suns. It revealed that the MCHS could achieve a cell temperature of less than 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Ahmed et al. [25] theoretically studied the temperature limits of active cooling for the HCPV subjected CR from 500 to 2000 suns. They used ethylene glycol water-based mixture (60:40) as a coolant, concluding that the selection of working fluid is subject to the CR, the required outlet temperature, and the required thermal energy. Single-phase multichannel cooling devices have many serious challenges; an increase in temperature with flow direction, high friction power, and flow maldistribution. Furthermore, non-uniformity in cell temperature is typically associated with thermal stresses. Thermal stresses represent a critical matter for the solar cell that could lead to structural damage [26]. Some recent studies are focused on enduring structural damages such as deformation and microcracks, which occurred due to high cell temperatures and hot spots formation [27]. Despite the considerable number of experimental and mathematical studies in the open literature of satisfactory uniform single-phase active cooling, several basic issues are still not well comprehended. Yet, the temperature non-uniformities distribution and flow maldistribution cause hotspots formation and decrease cell efficiency and reliability of the HCPV components. Based on the previous literature review, this research work aims to provide an efficient cooling heat sink with a new approach of variation of inlet and outlet flow directions for a state-of-the-art MJSC in a densely packed HCPV module (DP-HCPVM). This cooling method could attain a lower and more uniform cell temperature distribution, less power consumption, and less thermal stresses. A comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) thermal model coupled with a conjugate heat transfer model for DP-HCPVM/thermal (DP-HCPVM/T) are developed for different active cooling schemes. Accordingly, the originality of the current research work is based on two main concepts. Firstly, a new cooling MCHS for DP-HCPV under CR of 1000 suns is proposed and compared with the conventional straight MCHS. Secondly, different inlet and outlet orientations for the new and the conventional MCHS were examined toward more uniform cooling for the DP-HCPVM. Furthermore, the effect of water (as a coolant) inlet flowrate on the thermal performance of the DP-HCPVM/T was investigated. Also, thermal and electrical performances were assessed at all considered operating conditions, besides DP-HCPVM temperature uniformity was dissected and discussed.  In this section, an explanation of the thermal numerical model is covered in detail. Section 2.1 describes the model domains in detail, while the thermal model governing equations are included in Section 2.2. The boundary conditions and solution methods are described in Section 2.3. The hypotheses adopted in the current study are mentioned in the authors\u2019 previous work [28]. The entire system details of the current work are depicted in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 1(a), the detailed schematic diagram of the DP-HCPVM/T system in which a Fresnel lens concentration system is used to focus the sun rays onto the top surface of the DP-HCPVM. The two-axis tracking arrangement must be used for such a system where CR could reach up to thousands of suns (1 sun\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0W/m2) [29]. Fig. 1(b) displays the array arrangement of the DP-HCPVM, which consists of 56 AZURSPACE product multi-junction solar cells with an electrical efficiency of 43.2% at cell temperature 25\u00a0\u00b0C and cell area\u00a0=\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm2, along with the location of the MJ cells concerning the heat sink channels. The operating cell temperature (Tcell) used in the current module should be ranged between 20 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C for practical operation, while the maximum allowable Tcell is 110\u00a0\u00b0C [30]. The integration of DP-HCPVM with MCHS is shown in Fig. 1(c). An academic licensed version of ANSYS 19 R3 Fluent was used to complete the current study calculations. ANSYS Fluent simulation tool was employed as it includes wide libraries, boundary conditions, solution methods, and discretization schemes. The CFD commercial package ANSYS Fluent was utilized to solve the governing equations of steady-state, incompressible, and laminar conditions. The heat transfer and fluid flow equations including continuity, momentum, and energy were used the standard equations and coupled to complete the modeling procedures. Though, a heat generation source term as a result of absorbed solar radiation was set individually to the energy equation for each cell of the DP-HCPVM. Moreover, the source term was a function of Tcell which was unidentified. Therefore, an iterative technique was applied and considered for the accurate determination of the internal heat generation in each germanium layer for all solar cells [31]. The heat generation source term (qGe) in the cells layer because of solar radiation absorption was calculated as the following: qGe=1-\u03b7el\u00b7DNI\u00b7CR\u00b7\u03b7opt\u00b7\u03b1\u00b7AV where \u03b7el and \u03b1, are the solar module\u2019s electrical efficiency and module layer absorptivity, respectively. The term 1-\u03b7el represents the portion of the absorbed concentrated solar radiation that converted to heat. This part of thermal energy was dissipated by either heat loss from the solar cells top surface or absorbed by the coolant passing through the designed heat sink. And DNI and \u03b7opt, are the solar direct normal irradiance and optical efficiency, respectively. In this work, the value of 85% optical efficiency of the Fresnel lens was assumed. Besides, A and V are the DP-HCPVM\u2019s area and volume, respectively. In this case, this heat generation was only applied in the DP-HCPVM domain. The cell electrical efficiency varies with its temperature according to the following expression [32]: \u03b7el=\u03b7Ref1-\u03b2ThermalTcells-TRef where the reference cell efficiency at TRef\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C is \u03b7Ref\u00a0=\u00a043.2% [33,34]. The value of cell efficiency coefficient \u03b2Thermal\u00a0=\u00a00.047% per Kelvin is adopted. Therefore, based on Eqs. (1) and (2), the heat generation in the germanium layer can be estimated at certain cell operating temperatures. The 3D mathematical modeling was adopted in the current work as it is the most appropriate model for the temperature non-uniformity and hotspot location detection. The energy equation in the 3D form for the solid layers was coupled with the fluid flow and heat transfer governing equations in the two different heat sinks shown in Fig. 2 . The first MCHS (configuration 1) is the conventional straight microchannel heat sink (cSMCHS), as. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "shown in Fig. 2. Two different inlet and outlet orientations were investigated for configuration 1, as shown in Fig. 3 (Case 1 and Case 2). The concept of variation in the inlet and outlet orientation is a reduction in the local cell temperature toward more uniform cooling. Configuration 2 shown in Fig. 2 is the new convergent-divergent MCHS (nCDMCHS) and has the same external dimensions of the cSMCHS. The geometries and the dimensions of the nCDMCHS have certain constrains as the angle of divergence and convergence were equal to each other. Besides, the channel length of all cases is 25\u00a0mm. The detailed dimensions are listed in Table 1 . The hydraulic diameter was obtained using a nominal width of the channel. As shown in Fig. 3, three different cases of configuration 2 were investigated (Case 3, Case 4, and Case 5). The same heat sink design and geometry were investigated in Case 3, Case 4, and Case 5 with the dimensions described in Fig. 3 and listed in Table 1. The main difference between each of the three cases is the outlet and inlet orientations. The main objective, as previously mentioned, is for attaining more uniform cooling. The variation of inlet and outlet reduces the maldistribution of the heat transfer over the heat sink length. Moreover, when flow direction differs for every two adjacent channels (Case 2 for configuration 1 and Case 4 and Case 5 for configuration 2), more uniform cooling could happen. The heat transfer occurs between the top wall of the heat sink along with between every two adjacent channels with two different flow directions. Thus, heat dissipation by convection was improved. Indeed, using an advance inlet plenum like hierarchical, multichannel or multi-layered plenums is required for such designs which could increase the capital costs of the whole system for some amount. Also, the complicated inlet and outlet plenums usually are associated with an increase in friction losses, which increases the cooling cost. Though, the increase achieved in the electrical yield could compensate for the expenses increase of the proposed cooling devices in this work. Moreover, the exploitation of heat collected from that efficient cooling device could be used for downstream applications. In that way, the overall system net energy conversion will be increased. The DP-HCPVM dimensions and materials properties were discussed in detail in the authors\u2019 prior work [31]. All solid materials in the current model were considered as isotropic and temperature-independent materials. Water was employed as a cooling medium, and its thermo-physical properties were considered temperature dependant in the present work [31]. Consequently, water density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat were deemed as a fifth-order polynomial function of water temperature. A heat transfer model was completed to study the impact of MCHS design and flow direction on the thermal performance of the DP-HCPVM. The model solves the energy equation in multiple solid layers. For all solid domains, a 3D heat conduction equation was solved for solid layers as follows: \u2207\u00b7ki\u2207Ti+qi=0 where ki and Ti are thermal conductivity and temperature of the layer i, respectively. The qi is equal to the heat generation calculated from Eq. (1) for the DP-HCPVM domain. Where the heat generation is equal to zero for all other solid domain layers except the germanium layers. Then Eq. (3) was rewritten for the rest of the solid substrates as the following: \u2207\u00b7ki\u2207Ti=0 To solve the model governing Eq. (2), an iterative technique was implemented. The details of this iterative technique and the solution method were explained in detail in the authors' earlier work [31]. For all the fluid domain, the governing equations for the fluid domain represented by continuity equation, momentum equation, and energy equation, are as follows [30]: \u2207\u00b7\u03c1f\u03bd\u2192=0 \u03bd\u2192\u00b7\u2207\u03c1f\u03bd\u2192=-\u2207P+\u2207\u00b7\u03bcf\u2207\u03bd\u2192 \u03bd\u2192\u00b7\u2207\u03c1fCfT=\u2207\u00b7kf\u2207T where \u03c1 and \u03bc are water density and viscosity. \u03bd\u2192 and P are the velocity and the pressure of the cooling fluid, respectively. The hydraulic diameter (Dh) was calculated from the channel height (Hch) and the channel width (Wch) as follows: Dh=2\u00b7Hch\u00b7WchHch+Wch Reynolds number (Re) and friction power (F) for the fluid flow in MCHS were calculated using the following equations, where \u0394P is the pressure drop and m\u0307 is the coolant mass flowrate. Re=\u03c1f\u00b7\u03bd\u00b7Dh\u03bcf F=\u0394P\u00b7m\u0307\u03c1f The average Nusselt number and the overall thermal resistance for the MCHS were estimated by the following equations [35], where q\" is the heat flux, THS,avg and THS,max are the average and maximum heat sink temperature, TFD,avg is the average fluid domain temperature, and Tf,in is the inlet fluid temperature. Nuavg=q\"\u00b7DhTHS,avg-TFD,avg\u00b7kf Rth=THS,max-Tf,inq\" The boundary conditions used in the current model were stated in Table 2 . The convection and the radiation heat loss from the top and bottom surfaces of the computational domain were estimated as follows: qconv,layer\u2192a=hconv,windTlayer-Ta where hconv,wind represents the convective heat transfer coefficient due to the wind effect, and it was computed as follows: hconv,wind=5.82+4.07\u03bdwind The radiation heat loss is expressed as follows [30]: qrad,layer\u2192s=\u03c3\u00b7\u03b5Ge\u00b7TGe4-Ts4 Ts=0.0522Ta1.5 where Ts is the sky temperature in Kelvin. Regarding the fluid domain, inlet flow conditions were set to be uniform and velocity inlet (\u03bdf\u00a0=\u00a0\u03bdin) at Tf\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C. The pressure outlet was defined as zero-gauge pressure boundary condition at\u00a0the heat sink outlets, Pout\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0Pa (gauge pressure)\u00a0=\u00a0101.325\u00a0kPa (absolute pressure). The outlet backflow volume fraction and temperature are zero and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Besides, no-slip along with thermal coupling boundary conditions, were defined as follows: \u03bdfx,y,z=upi+vpj+wpk=0,Tf=TAlx,y,z  Mesh study was carried out to investigate the grid quality for the current model. The grid test was achieved by evaluating the outlet temperature of the coolant for the heat sink model, while the average cell temperature was employed for the model of the solar cell. Uniform tetrahedral meshes with a total number of 3.43 million and 3.26 million elements were selected for configuration 1 and configuration 2, respectively. The computational domain is separated into multi-zones and thermally coupled together. Such this manner permits controlling the element size for each zone individually. To increase mesh density in the fluid domain while decreasing it in the solid domains for compromising between the solution accuracy and. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "time. As shown in Fig. 4 , the grid sizes were selected when the results were not affected by grid size, and the maximum deviation is less than 2%. The current model was validated with available experimental and theoretical sets of data from the literature. First, triple-junction solar cell model was verified with experimental and numerical results conducted by Chow et al. [36]. The authors compared between average temperature values of a triple-junction solar cell with and without using thermal paste between the solar cell assembly and the heat sink. Their study was performed in terms of solar concentration ratio under continuous illumination, experimentally using an indoor solar simulator and numerically using COMSOL Multiphysics software. As shown in Fig. 5 , the results reached by the current model, show a good agreement with experimental and numerical results attained by Chow et al., with a maximum deviation of less than 1%. In order to validate the developed thermal model, another two validations were performed for the integration of HCPV solar cell with a heat sink under an active cooling scheme. HCPV/T model validation was carried out with experimental data of Aldossary et al. [30] and numerical data of Ahmed et al. [25]. Aldossary et al. [30] attached an AZURSPACE product triple-junction solar cell above a wide cooling channel, using an electrical heater as a heat flux source on the top surface of the solar cell. Their investigation was achieved under specific assumptions and conditions to show the average temperature at certain locations such as cell surface, cooling channel top wall, and coolant outlet. Regarding validation with Ahmed et al. [25], in the computational model, a single MJSC located on the top wall of straight MCHS. The computational domain considered in this work is shown in Fig. 7 . The performance of MJSC was compared at a mass flowrate range (0.001 to 0.006\u00a0kg/s). Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show a good agreement with an average error was about 2% and 3% compared with the results presented in [30] and [25], respectively.  The comparison between all the studied designs is highlighted only for surface average temperature, surface temperature uniformity, and pressure drop across the heat sink. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the surface average temperature is markedly affected by the cooling device design. The effect of the inlet mass flowrate was observed in all the studied cases. Regarding the heat sink design, for the cSMCHS design (configuration 1), Case 2 recorded a higher average temperature with a value of 83.6\u00a0\u00b0C at the lowest inlet mass flowrate. When the flow orientation was changed in Case 1, a considerable drop in the average cell temperature was attained. For the nCDMCHS (configuration 2), Case 4 and 5 represent the best and worst scenarios among the studied cases with an average cells temperature equals 74.2 and 98.2\u00a0\u00b0C at the minimum inlet mass flowrate, respectively. All the studied cases were within the recommended operating temperature range (50 \u2013 80\u00a0\u00b0C) except Case 5 through most of the inlet mass flowrate range and Case 2 at the lowest inlet mass flowrate. The inferior thermal performance and heat dissipation by Case 5 is a consequence of the flow inlet and outlet directions. This trend is the opposing effect of driving the coolant from a narrow area to a wider area as the fluid velocity near the outlet is very low. Furthermore, the fluid temperature increases from inlet to outlet then the heat transfer from the solid to fluid domain decrease near to the outlet, as will discuss later. The DP-HCPVM electrical efficiency is significantly affected by any rise in the average module temperature. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the best performance was obtained by Case 4 of the nCDMCHS design, as it showed the lowest average temperature because of the convective heat transfer coefficient improvement. The convergent channels have the advantage of increasing values of coolant velocity near the outlet; consequently, the advantages of high heat transfer performance were obtained. For more details, the fluid local temperature contours were exported of all the studied cases for a plane at the mid-thickness of the fluid domain to show the effect of heat sink design and flow direction. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) display the fluid local temperature contours at minimum and maximum coolant mass flowrate of 0.005 and 0.0167\u00a0kg/s, respectively. It is clear that flow direction is essential to gain high heat dissipation rates. The contours clarified the reason for the high heat dissipation of counter-current flow within the same heat sink. In contrast, when the flow entered the heat sink as a divergent channel, the performance of MCHS dropped as in cases 3 and 5. Case 5 showed the worst thermal performance as all the channels regarding the inlet and outlet directions were divergent channels besides the flow is parallel, then the performance of the MCHS considerably decreased. Subsequently, the DP-HCPVM local temperature distribution was affected by the flow direction and heat sink design. For instance, Fig. 9 shows the local temperature contours over the DP-HCPVM. The most important aspect of cooling dense-packed modules is temperature uniformity, which directly linked to the local temperature gradient. Fig. 10 (a) and (b) show the temperature profiles of DP-HCPVM under the highest and lowest inlet mass flowrate, respectively. By comparing the contours in Fig. 10(a) with (b), it is emphasized for each case; even the temperature values decreased with increasing the inlet mass flowrate, that the same local temperature distribution profile is observed but with different levels. In Case 1 of cSMCHS design, the maximum local temperature located near to the outlet, as previously confirmed by many other researchers [37]. This local temperature profile is one of the main disadvantages of straight channels heat sinks as the local temperature linearly increases with stream length of the cSMCHS [38]. For Case 2, the detected local temperature distribution is matching with the profiles obtained by Vasilev et al. [35]. This profile is due to the counter-current of the coolant, which led to a reduction. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "in the local temperature of the DP-HCPVM. One should also note that Case 4 is more advantageous to avoid overheating in the DP-HCPVM center zone. Case 4 takes the advantages of the counter-current flow along with the convergent channels to avoid the overheated zone near to the outlets and the center of the DP-HCPVM. In the analysis context, the temperature uniformity, which is defined as the temperature difference between maximum and minimum cell temperature (\u0394T = Tmax \u2212 Tmin), is essential to detect and prevent the current mismatching problems that threaten HCPV arrangements\u2019 performance and lifespan [39]. The uniformity is quantified in Fig. 11 and compared for all the studied cases in terms of inlet mass flowrate. Typically, the temperature uniformity increases with the increase of the inlet mass flowrate for all the cases. One should also note that the best temperature uniformity was attained by Case 4 for the lowest and highest inlet mass flowrate values, which approximately equals 10.7 and 5.6\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. At the same time, the worst cases are Case 3 and 1 as the achieved \u0394T\u00a0\u2248\u00a033 and 32.3\u00a0\u00b0C for the lowest inlet mass flowrate value, when it was about 21.6 and 21.3\u00a0\u00b0C for the highest inlet mass flowrate value. The comparison between the best case for each heat sink design illustrates that nCDMCHS (Case 4) achieved about 17.7% and 37.8% enhancement in temperature uniformity compared to cSMCHS (Case 2), at the lowest and highest inlet mass flowrate values, respectively. The average Nusselt number (Nuavg) in MCHS is an indicator of attainable heat transfer rates. Qualitatively, the local h and the local Nu are high in the zones of developing flow. Additionally, the enhanced temperature uniformities result in a better local Nu, consequently, a higher Nuavg was detected. Fig. 12 shows the dependence of the Nuavg on the inlet mass flowrate for all the involved cases. Qualitatively, the Nuavg increased with an increase in the inlet mass flowrate for all considered cases. It is clear that increasing the inlet flowrate, which in turn increases the heat transfer rate. Besides, the high Nuavg values were observed for the MCHS cases that had a high temperature uniformity degree. There is a very little difference between Case 1 of cSMCHS and Case 3 of nCDMCHS. However, Case 4 had the highest Nuavg values due to its high temperature uniformity degree and high average and local heat transfer coefficient. As it achieved about 4.9% and 12.6% improvement in average\u00a0Nusselt number compared to Case 3, because of the effect of counter-current flow, at the lowest and highest inlet mass flowrate, respectively. Along with about 14.1% and 21.9% compared to Case 2, because of the effect of heat sink design, at the lowest and highest inlet mass flowrate, respectively. Subsequently, thermal resistance (Rth) is representative of the total resistance for heat transfer within the MCHS, then a lower value of thermal resistance indicates favourable performance. As illustrated in Fig. 13 , Rth is reduced with inlet flowrate increment because of increasing convective heat transfer. Another point of view, Rth is highly affected with the geometry design, channel width variation, and flow direction as a result of convective heat transfer increment. The minimum Rth was about 12.1E\u22125 and 7.1E\u22125\u00a0\u00b0C\u22c5m2/W, obtained by Case 4 at the lowest and highest inlet mass flowrate, respectively. As the dependence of temperatures on the water properties was considered in the current work. Hence, any increase in the inlet flow causes an increase in the specific heat and thermal conductivity, so the thermal resistance was decreased. However, this effect is insignificant, as shown in Fig. 13. Pressure drop is considered as a crucial factor for thermal performance assessment, which could decrease the overall efficiency of DP-HCPVM/T system by depleting the net gained power. Therefore, as pressure drop increases, overall efficiency decreases. For the current work, with increasing inlet mass flowrate, the pressure drop was increased for both MCHS cases. Accordingly, an augmentation in the friction power occurred. It is observed from Fig. 14 , Case 5 has the minimum pressure drop values, and Case 4 has the maximum pressure drop values through the entire range of mass flowrate. From first glance, Case 5 and Case 4 represents the best and worst studied cases in terms of friction power. However, Case 4 recorded the maximum pumping power of 0.21\u00a0W at the highest inlet mass flowrate, which is less than 0.12% of produced electrical power at the same conditions. So, this value is still low and could be insignificant compared to the output generated power. Though case 4 attained the best performance among others, a large pumping requirement may associate with that scenario. Accordingly, achieving a uniform inlet and outlet velocities of each channel requires an advanced inlet and outlet plenum, which could increase the friction losses. Hence, designing and optimizing the inlet and outlet plenums should be revisited in the future studies.  The current work comprehensively investigated a new convergent-divergent microchannel heat sink design for thermal management of a dense-packed high concentrator photovoltaic module. The thermal characteristics including heat transfer, fluid flow, and energy were completed. The performance of the new convergent-divergent microchannel heat sink was compared with the conventional straight microchannel heat sink. The impact of flow direction was studied on both heat sinks by changing the inlet and outlet arrangement. The dense-packed high concentrator photovoltaic module performance was considered for a wide range of inlet mass flowrate and several cooling approaches using two different designs of microchannel heat sink. Several significant points could be concluded as follows: As a consequence of average cells temperature decrease with increasing inlet mass flowrate, the electrical efficiency of DP-HCPVM was increased. At maximum inlet mass flowrate value, Case 4 attained the highest electrical efficiency of 42.6%. Satisfactory temperature uniformity of 10.7 and 5.6\u00a0\u00b0C were attained by counter-current convergent-divergent microchannel heat sink design (Case 4). As it accomplished an improvement in temperature uniformity degree about 17.7% and 37.8% compared to cSMCHS (Case 2), at the lowest and highest inlet mass flowrate values, respectively.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Nusselt number for Case 4 was enhanced by 4.9% and 12.6% compared to Case 3, because of the effect of counter-current flow, and by 14.1% and 21.9% compared to Case 2, because of the impact of heat sink design, at the lowest and highest inlet mass flowrate, respectively. The lowest thermal resistance is about 7.1E\u22125\u00a0\u00b0C\u22c5m2/W, which obtained by Case 4 at the maximum studied mass flowrate. The maximum recorded pressure drop was less than 0.12% of the produced electrical power at the same conditions, so pressure losses could be considered insignificant for all cases.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Among the solar selective surfaces, most of them are prepared by magnetron sputtering , electrochemical method , painting , etc. However, due to the limitation of equipment cost, environment pollution and absorber quality, developing a cheap, convenient and environment friendly routine to prepare solar selective surface with high performance is always the hot spot. Copper is a universal substrate used in solar selective surface. Copper oxides (CuOx) such as CuO, Cu2O are both p-type semiconductors with band gap of 1.4 eV and 2 eV, respectively . Copper oxide thin films have wide range of applications in energy harvesting and storage, such as solar cells , photo-electro-chemical cells , photocatalysts , and lithium ion batteries . Up to now, as solar selective absorbers, selective copper\u2013black layers have been obtained by reactive sputtering , chemical vapor deposition (CVD) , anodizing , chemical conversion , thermal oxidization , etc. Chemical conversion method based on water solution is a simple, cheap and safe method without special equipment and rigorous condition to prepare copper\u2013black layers, thus the high performance copper\u2013black layers prepared by this method is cost attractive. In traditional chemical conversion process, oxidizers are NaClO2 , NaCrO2, NaClO3, K2S2O8 , etc. Due to the high valence of oxidizers, such as K2S2O8, NaClO3 and NaClO2, the morphology and composition as well as optical properties cannot be precisely controlled due to the high reaction rate. What is more, for K2S2O8, copper\u2013black layer is multi-composition contained CuS, CuO, Cu2O, Cu2S, etc., which inevitably results in the instability as well as high emissivity of thin films. For NaCrO2, the Cr ion is poisonous and can result in environment pollution. Herein, NaClO with low valence Cl element is chosen as oxidizer. The reaction is controlled in mild condition with addition of NaOH as stabilizer. The composition, morphology and optical properties can be controlled by reaction condition and the high performance thin films can be easily obtained using one-step process. The photo-thermal conversion efficiency of as-prepared thin films is up to 86%. The relationship between composition, morphology and optical properties are investigated in detail.  Metal copper plate (thickness = 0.1 mm) was purchased from Tianjin Fu Chen Chemical Regent Co., China. NaOH, NaClO, HCl were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Regent Co., China. All the reagents were analytical grade without further purification. Deionized water was used for all the preparation and treatment processes. Bright copper (Cu) plate was used as start material after washing by 0.1 M NaOH solution, 0.1 M HCl solution and deionized water in turn. To prepare the reaction solution, NaOH as stabilizer was firstly added into the deionized water to form the basic solution. Then the NaClO was added into basic solution with stirring to form the reaction solution. The reaction temperature was controlled by the homo-thermal water bath. For comparison, the Cu plates were cut into 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm and the reaction solution was kept as 30 mL for every Cu plate. In this work, the NaClO concentration was kept as 0.72 M. To eliminate the concentration gradient, the Cu plate was horizontally placed in the glass beaker with a ground glass lid. The molar ratio of NaOH/NaClO (R) was fixed at 2\u20134 with the temperature of 40, 60 and 80 \u00b0C, respectively. The reaction time was 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 min, respectively. The thin film was washed three times with deionized water before drying by the blower. The samples were labeled with experimental conditions. For thermal stability test, thin films were heated in the muffle at 150 \u00b0C for 24 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of thin film were obtained on X\u2019Pert Pro MPD diffractometer, using Cu K\u03b1 radiation at a scan rate of 0.02\u00b0 2\u03b8 s\u22121. UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR spectrum was obtained on the Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere in spectral interval of 0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm using BaSO4 as a reference, while the infrared reflection spectra were obtained on the Bruker Tensor 27 spectrophotometer in the range of 2.5\u201320 \u03bcm without integrating sphere. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed by an S-4800 field emission SEM (FESEM, Hitachi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV. The film thickness was measured by stylus profiler (Vecco D-150). All the measurements were performed at room temperature. The solar absorbance and the thermal emissivity can be calculated through reflection measurement R(\u03bb) as follows : \u03b1=\u222b0.3\u03bcm2.5\u03bcm[1\u2212R(\u03bb)]PSun(\u03bb)d\u03bb\u222b0.32.5PSun(\u03bb)d\u03bb \u03b5=\u222b2.5\u03bcm25\u03bcm[1\u2212R(\u03bb)]PB(\u03bb)d\u03bb\u222b2.525PB(\u03bb)d\u03bb where P Sun(\u03bb) is the normal solar spectral irradiance defined by the ISO standard 9845-1 (1992) for air mass (AM) 1.5 and P B(\u03bb) is the spectral radiance of a black body at a temperature (T). P B(\u03bb) is therefore given by Plank's law (Eq. (3)). Eq. (2) describes the portion of the black-body radiation absorbed by the sample in relation to the total black-body radiation. PB=C1\u03bb5[eC2/\u03bbT\u22121]C1=3.743\u00d710\u221216Wm2C2=1.4387\u00d710\u22122mK Calculations of absorbance and emissivity were performed using a Matlab program that incorporated Eqs. (1) and (3). For longer wavelength, the emission of radiation is not relevant because the heat-transfer agent (e.g. water) begins to absorb the IR-radiation in this region. Thus, the photo-thermal conversion efficiency \u03b7 is defined as : \u03b7=\u03b1\u2212\u03b5  Crystalline structure and composition of thin films are observed by XRD patterns.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "In Fig. 1(a), it can be found that the cubic phase Cu2O (JCPDS 05-0667) is observed in thin films after 5 min reaction at 40 \u00b0C. With the elongation of reaction time, diffraction peaks ascribed to Cu2O phase are enhanced while the diffraction peak at 43.3\u00b0 ascribed to Cu (1 1 1) plane (JCPDS 04-836) weakens and broadens sharply, which means that thickness and content of Cu2O thin films increases and the Cu substrate is less sensitive. However, no peak ascribed to CuO is observed in thin films prepared by 30 min reaction. When the reaction temperature is up to 60 \u00b0C, single Cu2O phase is observed for 5 min reaction and CuO begins appear after 10 min reaction in Fig. 1(b). With the increase of reaction time, the peaks ascribed to CuO are enhanced more sharply than those of Cu2O, which means that CuO is the main phase after longer time reaction at 60 \u00b0C. That the peak ascribed to Cu substrate becomes weak means that thin film is too thick to detect the substrate. For thin films prepared at 80 \u00b0C, diffraction peaks ascribed to CuO also appear after 10 min reaction. After 30 min reaction, the strongest peak of Cu2O closely disappears in Fig. 1(c), and the main peak ascribed to CuO is greatly enhanced. It means that portion of Cu2O can be transformed into CuO after elongation reaction time. Additionally, the strongest peak at 36.4\u00b0 ascribed to (1 1 1) plane of Cu2O degrades while other peaks ascribed to Cu2O enhance with the elongation of reaction time, which means that the preferential orientation of Cu2O is changed from (1 1 1) plane at 36.4\u00b0 to (1 0 0) plane at 42.3\u00b0 after long time reaction. However, the peaks in XRD patterns are broadening, which means that the crystallinity of thin film is weak. SEM images of thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C with different time are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be found that some square-like particles about hundreds of nanometers appear in thin film prepared by 5 min reaction and several big pores about hundreds of nanometers are existent between the particles. With the increase of reaction time, the square-like particles grow bigger with some small particles formation and the big pores disappear. When thin film is prepared by 25 min reaction, thousands of irregular porous and belt-like structures are formed and the surface of thin films is like a net composed of belts and pores. The morphology of thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be found that square-like structure about hundreds of nanometers are formed on the surface of thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C/5 min. When the reaction time is up to 10 min, the porous belt-like structure is formed on thin film surface. With the elongation of reaction time, the width of belts as well as the spacing between belts broadens. For thin films prepared at 80 \u00b0C, the belt-like structure is formed after only 5 min reaction. With the elongation of reaction time, the width of belts broadens and the spacing between belts enlarges apparently, which is far more than that of thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C. The reflection spectra of thin films prepared at 80 \u00b0C with different reaction time are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be found that reflection spectra show apparent selectivity. In the solar spectrum region (0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm), the reflectance is relatively low, while in the infrared region (2.5\u201320 \u03bcm), the reflectance is rather high and the reflectance in some region is near to 100%. For thin films prepared by 3 min reaction, there are several valleys and peaks in the UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR range of reflection spectrum, which means that the film is thin and the valleys and peaks may be resulted from incident light interference with thin film interface. The film thickness is shown in Table 1 . With the elongation of reaction time, the interference peaks in reflection spectra degrade gradually due to the increase of film thickness as well as absorption resulting from CuOx. When the reaction time is longer than 10 min, there is no interference peaks existent in reflection spectra and the reflectance in the visible spectrum region is near to 2%, which means that film is thick enough to absorb visible light. Simultaneously, the absorption edge of thin films in the UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR region is also red-shift with the elongation of reaction time, which means that the film is with nanostructure and the crystalline size is increasing with the elongation of reaction time. The film thickness is increasing with the elongation of reaction time, which can enhance absorbance in all spectra region. Thus, the reflectance in the infrared region is also decreasing with the elongation of reaction time and some apparent absorption peaks appear. The absorption peak at 16.5 \u03bcm (605 cm\u22121) is ascribed to Cu2O, which is consistent with the results in Ref. . It can be found that the absorption of Cu2O is increasing with the elongation of reaction time, which means that the content of Cu2O in thin film is increased. The broad absorption band around 6.67 \u03bcm (1500 cm\u22121) is ascribed to hydroxy (\u2013OH) . According to reflection spectra, the absorbance and emissivity (25 \u00b0C) of thin films prepared at 80 \u00b0C are calculated and shown in Fig. 5 . It can be found that the absorbance of thin film prepared at 40 \u00b0C is lower than that of thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C. There are at least three reasons for this. Firstly, for thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C, single Cu2O phase is existent in thin films (see Fig. 1(a)), while for thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C, Cu2O and CuO are coexistent in thin films (see Fig. 1(b and c)). Due to the band gap difference, the absorbance of Cu2O at 0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm is smaller than that of CuO. Thus, higher absorbance can be. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "obtained in thin films containing CuO. Surface morphology is another factor to influence absorptance. For thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C, square-like structure is formed on the film surface (see Fig. 2). The square-like structure about hundreds of nanometers is like a mirror to reflect incident light except for intrinsic absorption. While for thin films prepared at 60 and 80 \u00b0C, the porous belt-like structure like a net is easily formed on the film surface. The spacing about hundreds of nanometers between belts like a light trap is helpful to decrease reflectance and enhance absorbance especially in solar spectrum region (0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm). Film thickness is an additional factor to influence the absorbance. Considering the same reaction time, higher temperature is beneficial for the reaction rate as well as the increase of film thickness. The increase of thickness can inevitably enhance absorbance. Thus, higher absorptance is obtained in samples prepared at 60 and 80 \u00b0C with thicker thin films. However, thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C/30 min also have high absorptance. That is because the net-like structure and enough thickness are finally obtained after long time reaction. When compared with thin films prepared at 60 and 80 \u00b0C with different time, it can be found that absorptance of thin films prepared at different temperatures are almost accordance with each other except for thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C/5 min and 80 \u00b0C/5 min. Thin films prepared at 80 \u00b0C/5 min with net-like surface have higher absorptance than that of thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C/5 min. It can be deduced that the net-like surface has great effect on film absorptance. Additionally, the absorptance is increasing with the elongation of reaction time at same temperature. It maybe results from the increase of film thickness, crystallinity and the content of CuO as well as the change of surface morphology. The emissivity gradually increases with the elongation of reaction time and the accelerated speed of emissivity is much quicker at high temperature. It is the reason that emissivity is a surface property and depends on the surface condition of material . Firstly, the film thickness increases with the increase of reaction time and temperature, which can enhance the absorbance and reduce reflectance in IR region. The reduction of reflectance in IR region inversely increases emissivity. Secondly, the surface morphology is transformed from square-like structure to porous belt-like structure which can inevitably enhance the roughness of thin films. The increase of roughness can increase the scattering and reduce the reflectance of thin films. Thus, thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C have relatively low emissivity. Additionally, composition is another factor to influence reflectance and emissivity. However, the effect is not apparent in present results. According to Eq. (4), the highest photo-thermal conversion efficiency \u03b7 for thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C is 0.68, 0.85 and 0.86, respectively, which is corresponding to the reaction time of 15 min, 10 min and 5 min. The optimal photo-thermal conversion efficiency is comparable to that of commercial solar selective thin films prepared by sputtering method. XRD patterns of thin films prepared at different R values are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be found that R value greatly influences the composition of thin films. For thin films prepared at R = 2, diffraction peaks ascribed to CuO and Cu2O appear after 5 min reaction. The intensity of peaks ascribed to CuO is sharply increasing with the elongation of reaction time, while the peaks ascribed to Cu2O degrade. It means that some Cu2O can be transformed into CuO. For thin film prepared at R = 4, only weak peaks ascribed to Cu2O appear after 5 min reaction. With the elongation of reaction time, peaks ascribed to CuO appear and greatly enhance with the degradation of Cu2O main peak. Combination with the XRD results shown in Fig. 1, it can be deduced that low R value more easily results in the formation of CuO than that of high temperature especially for short time reaction (5 min). Through the surface morphology of thin films shown in Fig. 7 , it can be found that the porous belt-like structure is formed in thin films prepared at R = 2 for 5 min reaction. The width of belts and spacing between belts are barely changed with the increase of reaction time. It means that the net-like surface is formed and stable after short time reaction. When thin films prepared at R = 4, the square-like particles are formed after 5 min reaction and the size distribution of particles is inhomogenous from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. With the elongation of reaction time, the shape of particles on film surface is greatly changed. For thin films prepared by 10 min reaction, porous belt-like structure is formed. However, the belts are rough and irregular and the spacing between belts is relatively small. The belts become smooth and the spacing between belts broadens in thin films prepared by 30 min reaction. Combination with the SEM images in Figs. 2 and 3, it can be deduced that square-like structure is easily formed at low temperature and high R value, while the porous belt-like structure is easily formed at high temperature and low R value. The absorptance and emissivity of thin films prepared at different R and time are shown in Fig. 8 . For thin films prepared at R = 2, absorptance promptly increases to 0.94 after 5 min reaction, while it increases to 0.97 after 10 min reaction and becomes constant with the elongation of reaction time. For thin films prepared at R = 4, absorptance slowly increases after 5 min reaction. The sharp increase of absorptance appears for thin films prepared by 10 min reaction. It increases a little after 15 min reaction and becomes constant with the elongation of reaction time. While for thin film prepared at R = 3, the variance of absorptance is between that of thin films prepared at R = 2 and R =. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "4. The variance of absorptance is also related with the composition, morphology and film thickness. When R value is small, the relative concentration of NaClO is high and the rate of oxidation is quick, which can result in the increase of film thickness and CuO amount. Thus, absorptance of thin films prepared at R = 2 is promptly increased and is higher than that of film prepared at R = 3 and 4. Additionally, the porous belt-like surface is another factor to enhance absorptance. Due to the quicker oxidation rate and stable surface morphology, absorptance of films prepared at R = 2 can be quickly close to 0.97. Compared with absorptance of thin films prepared at R = 3 and R = 4 for 5 min reaction, it further proves that the porous belt-like surface like a net is important for high absorptance. The emissivity of thin films is increasing with the elongation of reaction time. However, the emissivity of thin films prepared at R = 2 is apparently larger than that of thin films prepared at R = 3 and R = 4. It is because that the quicker oxidation rate in R = 2 results in the sharp increase of film thickness, roughness and CuO content. However, after 30 min reaction, emissivity of thin films prepared at different R values is close to each other. It may be the reason that the composition and morphology becomes approximate with each other and film thickness is too thick to influence emissivity after enough long time reaction. The optimal photo-thermal efficiency \u03b7 is 0.86 and 0.83 for R = 2 at 5 min and R = 4 at 15 min, respectively, which means that the high performance solar selective thin films can be easily obtained by this simple and low cost method. It is well-known that film structure is influenced by reaction temperature, time, PH value and film composition. From the analysis of our above experiments, the process of morphology transformation is summarized in Fig. 9 and a possible mechanism for the structure transformation of thin films is proposed. In present experimental process, the chemical reaction is as follows: 2Cu + NaClO \u2192 Cu2O + NaCl Cu2O + NaClO + 2H2O \u2192 2Cu(OH)2 + NaCl Cu(OH)2 \u2192 CuO + H2O At the beginning of reaction, the Cu2O particles nucleate. The surface of Cu2O particles contains high index crystallography planes, through which the particles connect with each other to decrease the surface energy of the planes . As the reaction proceeds, the polyhedral particles grow along the different directions with different growth rates due to their different surface energies (see Fig. 2(a\u2013c)). Due to the coalescence of neighboring grains, the size of the agglomerates increases. For the cubic phase of Cu2O, both the (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) facets are with low surface energy and can be easily maintained in the final appearance . Therefore, the (1 1 1) plane of Cu2O is firstly observed in XRD patterns. It has been demonstrated that the surface energy of (1 0 0) facets of Cu2O can be selectively lowered relative to that of (1 1 1) facets in the presence of chloride ions, which can stabilize {1 0 0} facets . Thus, the enhanced peak intensity of (1 0 0) plane and degraded peak intensity of (1 1 1) plane of Cu2O is observed in XRD patterns with prolonged reaction time. Generally, the growth habit of Cu2O depends on not only their crystal characteristic but also the supersaturation of the solute. Mcfadyen and Matijevilc found that the shape of Cu2O particles changed from polyhedron to needle when the solute concentration was rather low. Chen et al. found that the bundled grains of Cu\u2013W thin films could be transformed into porous belt-like structure after corrosion. They thought that the different corrosion rate of Cu and W was the main reason for this special structure. For thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C for 25 min reaction, the concentration of NaClO is rapidly decreased and the oxidization rate is relatively slow. Thus, Cu+ ions in the solution are low and the belt-like structure is formed for long time reaction. While for thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C, high temperature enhances the oxidization speed and the formation of CuO (see Fig. 1(b) and (c)). Due to the monoclinic phase of CuO, the tiny rhombic CuO particles aggregate to form primary rhombic one-dimensional (1D) CuO nanostructures. The primary rhombic 1D nanostructures are aligned one by one along some main crystallographic axes of CuO to form belt-like structure via an \u2018oriented attachment\u2019 growth process, which is similar to the growth mechanism of shuttle-like CuO . The width of belts and spacing between belts broadening with the elongation of reaction time is resulted from the ripen process. Though the PH value of solution at different NaOH concentrations is similar and is about 12\u201313, the high concentration of NaOH postpones the formation of CuO to some extent (see Fig. 6(a) and (b)). Thus the low concentration of NaOH is beneficial for the belt-like structure (see Fig. 7). However, thin films prepared without NaOH is badly oxidized and the photo-thermal efficiency is rather low (the results are not shown here). The reflection spectra of thin films before and after heat treatment are shown in Fig. 10 . It can be found that after heating the reflectance sharply increases especially in the region of 0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm, which can inversely degrade the absorptance in solar spectrum region (0.3\u20132.5 \u03bcm). According to the morphology shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b), it can be found that the belt-like structure is still existent and almost constant after heating. From the XRD results shown in Fig. 10(d), it can be found that the main peaks ascribed to Cu2O are enhanced after heating, which means that portion of CuO transform into Cu2O during heating. The absorbance of Cu2O is lower than that of CuO, so the reflectance is boosted after heating. However, after spinning a. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "ZnO thin layer on the thin films surface as shown in Fig. 10(c), the reflectance in the solar spectrum region is improved after annealing at 150 \u00b0C for 24 h, while the reflectance in the infrared region does not deteriorate, which means that ZnO thin films on the CuOx thin film surface can improve the photo-thermal stability. The detailed research of ZnO on the CuOx thin films is investigated in future.  The CuOx thin films as solar selective surface can be conveniently prepared by one-step chemical conversion method. The reaction time, temperature and concentration can greatly influence the composition, structure and optical properties as well as photo-thermal efficiency of thin films. For thin films prepared at 40 \u00b0C, pure Cu2O is formed in thin films and the highest photo-thermal efficiency is 0.68 at 15 min. While for thin films prepared at 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C, both Cu2O and CuO are formed after 10 min reaction and the highest photo-thermal efficiency is 0.85 at 10 min and 0.86 at 5 min, respectively. The concentration of NaOH has weak effect on photo-thermal efficiency compared with temperature. For R = 2\u20134, the highest photo-thermal efficiency is 0.86 at 5 min, 0.86 at 5 min, 0.83 at 15 min, respectively. The belt-like surface is a key factor to influence the absorptance, while the thickness and roughness of thin films are the main factor to influence emissivity. According to the thermal stability test, it can be found that CuOx thin films is stable below 150 \u00b0C, while a ZnO thin layer on the surface can greatly enhance the stability at 150 \u00b0C.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2019.143997.txt", "paper": ["Over the past several years, optoelectronic devices, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) [1], organic solar cells [2], and field effect transistors, have been extensively developed [3,4]. Transparent conductive films (TCFs) are essential in all of these optoelectronic devices. Indium tin oxide (ITO), the conventional conductive metal oxide thin film, has been widely used for transparent electrodes. However, a few drawbacks of ITO such as its high cost due to indium scarcity, complicated processing requirements, sensitivity to acid and basic environments, and cracking and delaminating when subjected to bending deem it unsuitable for applications that require flexibility. For these reasons, numerous candidate materials including metal nanowires [5,6], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [7,8], graphene [9,10], and conducting polymers [11,12] are being actively investigated as replacements for ITO. Among these materials, CNTs present potential advantages in chemical stability, thermal and electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, flexibility, and work function (4.5\u20135.2\u202feV) [13]. However, many problems must be overcome. For instance, CNT films suffer from weak interfacial adhesion to substrates resulting from their inherent tube\u2013tube junctions; moreover, these junctions readily open, causing relatively high sheet resistance [14]. Recently, Han et al. [15] introduced graphene oxide (GO) as a multi-purpose p-type dopant for CNT films. Although GO sheets deposited onto the porous nanotube networks reduced the surface roughness, there was no significant effect on improving the conductivity and film adhesion by this method. Polydopamine (PDA), which mimics adhesive proteins [16,17], was used to simultaneously reduce (reduced GO, RGO) and functionalize GO during self-polymerization [18]. Therefore, PDA functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PDA-RGO) was used as a conductive adhesion promoter to improve the interfacial adhesion between the conductive coating layers and substrate. Spray coated poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was applied for planarization of TCFs [19,20], owing to its intrinsic fairly high conductivity, high transparency in the visible range, and outstanding film-forming properties. However, pristine PEDOT:PSS films exhibit a very low conductivity (<1\u202fS/cm) and cannot be used as a stand-alone electrode. Fortunately, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be increased up to 2 or 3 orders of magnitude by adding some components, such as organic compound salts, zwitterions, carboxylic or inorganic acids, or cosolvents [21,22,23]. Despite ample efforts and success in improving the conductivity, it is still too low to meet the demands of optoelectronic applications. Therefore, We have taken an effective method to significantly enhance the conductivity and crystallinity of the \u03c0-conjugated polymer coating layer by DMSO-EG bath combined with H2SO4 treatment [24]. In this study, we fabricated a high performance, flexible transparent electrode with a structure resembling that of reinforced concrete by sandwiching CNTs between PEDOT:PSS and PDA-RGO by using a simple method, spray coating. The successful functionalization of reduced graphene oxide by PDA was confirmed and characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopies. The modified RGO was expected to improve the interfacial adhesion between the conductive coating layers and substrate. Moreover, an effective post fabrication treatment method was performed on the hybrid films to obtain better conductivity, and the conductivity mechanism was systematically investigated. To verify the potential applications of this hybrid film, which have excellent optical conductivity, low root mean square (rms) roughness, and ultra-adhesion to substrates, the organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which using PDA-RGO/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS film as anode was successfully fabricated and characterized.  The GO nanosheets were prepared via a modified Hummers\u2019 method. High purity single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs, purity of 95\u202fwt%, diameter less than 2\u202fnm, length >5\u202f\u03bcm) were provided from Carbon Star Technology (Tianjin) Co. Ltd. Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), dopamine hydrochloride (98%), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) (99.8%), ethylene glycol (EG), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Aladdin. PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios pH 1000) with a concentration of 1.3\u202fwt% was purchased from H. C. Starck. All reagents were used as received. PDA-RGO was prepared as follows: 200\u202fmg of GO and 100\u202fmg of dopamine hydrochloride were added to 400\u202fml of Tris buffer solution (10\u202fmM, pH\u202f=\u202f8.5) and dispersed by sonication for 10\u202fmin while submerged in an ice bath. Afterwards, the solution was vigorously stirred at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh; the color of the GO suspension changed from dark brown to black during the stirring process. After the reduction reaction, few-layer and uniformly sized PDA-RGO sheets were obtained by washing via centrifugation. Finally, the PDA-RGO precipitate was repeatedly washed with distilled water several times to remove free PDA particles and thick multilayer flakes, and a clean PDA-RGO solution (0.1\u202fmg/ml) was obtained. The preparation of the SWCNT solutions was reported in our previous work [25]. CNTs were dispersed in deionized water (1\u202fmg/ml) using SDBS as a dispersant. Then, the solution was sonicated in a bath sonicator for 30\u202fmin followed by probe ultrasonication at 120\u202fW for 30\u202fmin to obtain a suspension solution. The mixture was centrifuged at 8000\u202frpm for 20\u202fmin, and the 80% supernatant was collected. Flexible polymer-polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates were immersed in ethanol with bath ultrasonication to remove contamination. Then the clean PET substrates were dried in a dryer for later processing. DMSO (5\u202fwt%) was added into the PEDOT:PSS solution, after which the mixture was diluted ten times with deionized water and magnetic stirring for one hour to ensure good mixing. First, the PET films were fixed on a heating plate, and the PDA-RGO solution was poured into the airbrush and sprayed on the surface of the PET substrates. Then, the SWCNT solution was sprayed onto the PDA-RGO layer. In order to remove the SDBS between the coating layers, the PDA-RGO/SWCNT films were immersed in deionized water for 20\u202fmin; after drying, the samples were immersed in 12\u202fM nitric acid for 30\u202fmin, and the residual acid was washed away by deionized water several times. The TCFs were dried again at 80\u202f\u00b0C. Next, the PEDOT:PSS solution was sprayed on the PDA-RGO/SWCNT networks to form PDA-RGO/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS films. These films were immersed in EG for 40\u202fmin and washed by deionized water, after which they were annealed in air at 120 \u2103 for 15\u202fmin to remove DMSO and EG. A 1\u202fM H2SO4 solution was pipetted onto the dried films at 120\u202f\u00b0C and kept on the sample. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "for 5\u202fmin. The film was then further washed by deionized water and annealed again. Finally, we obtained the sandwich structured PDA-RGO/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS based TCFs. In our study, all spray conditions were maintained at a constant spray velocity with a 0.3\u202fMPa spraying pressure and 15\u202fcm distance between the nozzle and the substrate. During the spray coating process, the PET substrates were heated at 120\u202f\u00b0C on a hotplate to avoid the coffee-ring effect. The OLED structures in this study were (PDA-RGO/SWCNT/PEDOT) / NPB (40\u202fnm)/Alq3 (60\u202fnm)/LiF (0.8\u202fnm)/Al (100\u202fnm). All of the organic materials were thermally evaporated onto the patterned anodes using a thermal evaporation coating system at a pressure of approximately 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fPa. The transmittance of the films was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at 550\u202fnm. The sheet resistance of the films was measured using the four-point probe method (Keithley 2700 multi-meter). The surface morphology of the films was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Hitachi S-4800) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, BRUKER). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Hitachi H-800 electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 120\u202fkV. The changes in the surface functional groups were detected by XPS (ELMER PHI 5600, Al K\u03b1 source) and FT-IR (TENSOR37), and the surface wettability was assessed by a contact-angle analysis device (DSA100, KRUSS). The nanostructures were further characterized via a DXR Raman microscope with a laser excitation wavelength of 532\u202fnm. The adhesion was investigated using the 3\u202fM tape test, in which the tapes adhere to the films by rubbing the entire surface area using constant pressure and then peeled off from the samples. The performance of the OLEDs was characterized by an optical detection system for OLED display panels developed by Suzhou Fstar Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.  The morphology and structure of the GO and PDA-RGO nanosheets were observed by TEM. In Fig. 1 a, the large GO sheet (ca. 4\u202f\u03bcm) has a planar texture with a smooth surface. After being modified by PDA, the PDA-RGO nanosheet exhibits an obvious rough surface with folds and wrinkles resembling gecko feet, which may increase the contact area and enhance the adhesion to substrates, as shown in Fig. 1b [26]. The synthesized GO and PDA-RGO were further characterized by UV-vis, Raman, FT-IR, and XPS. The simultaneous reduction and surface functionalization of GO took place during the oxidative self-polymerization of dopamine, and GO was converted into PDA-RGO. The successful reduction of GO to PDA-RGO was confirmed by UV-Vis. As shown in Fig. 2 a, GO exhibits a characteristic absorption peak at 230\u202fnm, however, the peak shifts to 260\u202fnm in PDA-RGO, which is a characteristic peak of RGO, indicating a refreshed electronic conjugation in graphene sheets due to the reduction of GO. The reduction of GO was further verified by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2b, GO and PDA-RGO exhibit two characteristic peaks. The spectra of GO and PDA-RGO are characterized by D and G bands. The D and G bands of GO are found at 1358 and 1591\u202fcm\u22121, respectively. As for PDA-RGO, the curve displays a strong D band at 1353\u202fcm\u22121 and a G band at 1589\u202fcm\u22121. The red shifting of the two bands upon dopamine reduction is an indication of graphitic self-healing behavior [27]. The ratio of the intensities of D and G bands (I D/I G) is used to evaluate the degree of graphitization and the defect density in graphene materials. Here, the value of I D/I G increased from 0.84 to 0.94, which is attributed to the formation of smaller graphitic domains during the reduction of GO. Furthermore, the surface functionalization of GO by PDA is also evident in the FT-IR and XPS spectra. As shown in its FT-IR spectrum in Fig. 2c, GO exhibits 3 characteristic peaks at around 1060, 1400, and 1731\u202fcm\u22121 that correspond to the C O (epoxy or alkoxy), C OH (hydroxyl), and C O (carboxyl) bonds of the GO skeleton, respectively, which are characteristic features of the FT-IR spectrum of GO. When compared with the spectrum of GO, that of PDA-RGO reveals two new peaks at 1386 and 1465\u202fcm\u22121, corresponding to C OH bending in the catechol groups and the stretching of C N bonds, respectively, thus confirming the successful grafting of PDA molecular chains onto the surface of the GO sheets. In addition, the band at 1726\u202fcm\u22121 for the carbonyl group almost disappeared, indicating that GO was reduced during the self-polymerization [28]. Generally speaking, these results demonstrate the simultaneous reduction and surface functionalization of GO that results in PDA-RGO. The change of the chemical information in GO and PDA-RGO was also investigated by XPS. Fig. 2d shows the XPS survey spectra of GO and PDA-RGO. The O/C ratios of GO and PDA-RGO are 0.38 and 0.27, respectively. It is clear that the peak intensities of the oxygen-containing groups on PDA-RGO have decreased significantly, which is due to the release of electrons that attack the oxygen-containing species such as C O in GO during the polymerization of dopamine; the process reduces GO to some extent and facilitates the nucleation and growth of PDA film on the RGO sheets. In addition, the N 1s peak at 400.0\u202feV, which is related to the amine group of PDA, was only observed in the PDA-RGO spectrum. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO and PDA-RGO are shown in Fig. 2e and 2f, respectively. The XPS C1s core-level spectrum of GO can be divided into four peak components with binding energies at approximately 284.9, 286.9, 288.3, and 289.7\u202feV, which can be indexed to C C/C C, C O, C O, and O C O species, respectively. For PDA-RGO, five different peaks at 284.7, 285.7, 286.4, 288.6, and 291.16\u202feV are related to the C C/C C, C N, C O, C O, and O C O groups, respectively. The emergence of the new C N peak further indicates the successful functionalization of PDA-RGO by PDA. Moreover, the strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction also proven; due to the similar structure of PDA and GO, the PDA coating on GO is highly stable. Thus, functionalizing. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "GO using PDA combined advantages of both covalent and noncovalent functionalization [29]. The SEM image in Fig. 3 a shows the CNT film was after washing with deionized water and nitric acid sequentially [30]. The random entanglement among tubes may increase the roughness of the film and generate hundreds of nanoscale pores, resulting in poor carrier transport [31]. The SEM image of the PDA-RGO/CNT film in Fig. 3b reveals that the CNTs and PDA-RGO sheets are homogeneously distributed on the substrate. The higher magnification SEM image shown in Fig. 3c indicates that the large-sized PDA-RGO sheets with wrinkles cover the holes in the CNT network and act as a bridge between CNT bundles, which created several new electrical percolation channels [32]. In Fig. 3d, an image of the untreated PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS film is shown; it exhibits a fairly flat surface, likely because the pores in the networks and the wrinkles from the PDA-RGO sheets were covered by PEDOT:PSS [33]. The surface of the film after the DMSO-EG bath and H2SO4 treatments remains relatively flat as shown in Fig. 3e. The surface of the PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS-treated film after the 3\u202fM tape adhesion test is shown in Fig. 3f, in which many tubular structures are exposed, but the coating remains intact due to the catechol groups of PDA-RGO serving as an anchor, thus enhancing the adhesion between the coating and the substrate. An adhesion factor incorporating transmittance, which can be easily measured from absorption spectroscopy, was applied to quantitatively characterize the adhesion as follows [34]: fT=1-Tn-T0100-T0=1-\u0394T100-T0 where fT is the adhesion factor, and T0 and T1 are the transmittance of hybrid films before and after the trial test, respectively. As shown in Table 1 , the adhesion factor of all 10 treated PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS samples (S1\u2013S10) is all higher than 0.92, which indicates ultra-adhesion of the films. However, the CNT films and pure PEDOT:PSS films have different degrees of shedding after trial test. Fig. 4 shows AFM images of the CNT, PDA-RGO/CNT, untreated PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS, and treated PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS films, from which the rms roughness of the sample surfaces was determined; the rms is 12.00, 5.12, 1.09, and 2.41\u202fnm, respectively. We suggest that doping PDA-RGO into the CNT network reduced the surface roughness of the CNT films, and the presence of the PEDOT:PSS layer resulted in the desired smooth surface structures. Despite the increase in surface roughness measured on the PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS film after treatment in the DMSO-EG bath and H2SO4, it is still much lower than that of the pure CNT samples. Such a low electrode surface roughness is advantageous for device performance. The PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS film's ultra-adhesion and relatively low roughness can likely be attributed to its special architectural structure that also enhances the film's electrical conductivity. The insulating surfactant SDBS was effectively removed, and the formation of the subsequent densified film improved the cross-junction conductivity within the CNT network, enhancing the metallicity of the CNTs. However, the CNTs were entangled by X-type junctions that could easily open. Therefore, PDA-RGO sheets with abundant catechol functional groups were carefully introduced to bind the CNTs firmly together, acting like an adhesive. This is depicted in Fig. 5 a. The two-dimensional conductive PDA-RGO sheets act as a p-type dopant and surface energy modifier of the CNT film, which decreases the Schottky barrier height between the nanotubes to improve the conductivity of hybrid film (For the PDA-RGO film, it has a sheet resistance of 8.26 M\u03a9/sq. at the transparency of 80% at 550\u202fnm). In Fig. 5b, the stretchable PEDOT:PSS film coating placed on the PDA-RGO/CNT layer fills up the voids of the CNT network and covers the wrinkled structure of the PDA-RGO sheets, thus smoothing the surface morphology of the hybrid films and significantly decreasing the sheet resistance. The combination of materials in the hybrid film results in a structure similar to that of reinforced concrete in buildings, shown in Fig. 5c. Such a structure effectively improves the stability of film during bending. For TCFs, high optical transmission in combination with low sheet resistance is key to improving the performance of thin-film optoelectronic devices. The relationship between transmittance and sheet resistance of the pure CNT, PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS (untreated), PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS-DMSO-EG bath treated (DMSO-EG bath treated), and PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS-DMSO-EG bath and H2SO4 treated (DMSO-EG bath and H2SO4 treated) films is shown in Fig. 6 . The pure CNT films exhibit a sheet resistance of 58.8\u202f\u03a9/sq. with an optical transmittance of 80% at 550\u202fnm. The untreated films show poor conductivity (Rs\u202f=\u202f462.2\u202f\u03a9/sq., T\u202f=\u202fca. 80% at 550\u202fnm), which is likely caused by the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer that usually has a conductivity below 1 S/cm. After being treated with organic solvent, the resistance of the hybrid films is reduced to some extent (Rs\u202f=\u202f246.3\u202f\u03a9/sq., T\u202f=\u202fca. 80% at 550\u202fnm). In order to further improve the electrical properties of the TCFs, we innovatively used organic solvents combined with inorganic acids to treat the hybrid films; when compared with the pure CNT film, the resistance of the hybrid films decreased significantly (an order of magnitude) to 35.5\u202f\u03a9/sq., and the film simultaneously exhibited a high optical transmittance of 79.9% at 550\u202fnm. In addition, the hybrid films continue to exhibit a low sheet resistance (52.2\u202f\u03a9/sq.) at 88.7%. optical transmittance. The changes in the films during the treatment are discussed in detail below. To quantitatively characterize the optoelectrical properties of the treated PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS films, an approximate relationship between the optical transmittance and sheet resistance, direct current conductivity (\u03c3dc), and optical conductivity (\u03c3op) is given by following relation [35]: \u03c3DC\u03c3Op=188\u03a9RsT1-T where, Rs is the sheet resistance, and T is the transmittance of the TCFs. The values of \u03c3op/\u03c3dc for the 10 DMSO-EG bath and H2SO4 treated samples are listed in Table 2 . It is found that when the transmittance is above 77.12%, the values of \u03c3op/\u03c3dc are higher than 44.0, which is excellent performance when compared with Zheng\u2019s report (\u03c3op/\u03c3dc\u202f=\u202f7.48) [36] and our previous work (\u03c3op/\u03c3dc\u202f=\u202f25.3) [37]. The effect of the polar solvent and inorganic acid on the PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS film was characterized by FT-IR and XPS. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the FT-IR spectra of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "three type films (untreated, DMSO-EG bath treated, and DMSO-EG bath and H2SO4 treated) all show similar characteristic peaks. The vibrations around 1266\u20131456\u202fcm\u22121 correspond to C C and C C stretching of the quinoidal structure and ring stretching of thiophene rings (similar to benzoidal structure). Further vibrations at approximately 1160 and 1011\u202fcm\u22121 are both assigned to the stretching modes of the C O C bond, and the peak at 941\u202fcm\u22121 is indexed to the ethylenedioxy group in the molecular deformation mode. Also, the C S bond vibrations in the thiophene ring are found at 993 and 858\u202fcm\u22121. No significant differences were observed in the FT-IR spectra of the films, but the peaks shifted to higher wave numbers after treatment, which suggests an intermolecular interaction in the PEDOT:PSS layer [38]. The change of the films before and after the polar solvent and acid treatment was further confirmed by XPS (Fig. 7b). The two typical S 2p peaks were observed at binding energies below and above 166.0\u202feV, corresponding to the sulfur atoms in PEDOT and PSS, respectively. The ratio of the peak area of S 2p in PSS to that in PEDOT for the three types of films is 2.96, 2.40, and 1.67, respectively, which suggests the loss of PSS from the PEDOT:PSS films after treatment. The removal of PSS during treatment is caused by polymer chain expansion or the phase separation between the conducting PEDOT-rich grains and the insulating PSS [39]. The change in the transmittance before and after treatment is presented in Fig. 7c. Due to the removal of PSS in the PEDOT:PSS layer, the treated films possess better optical transmission than the untreated films. Fig. 7d shows the contact angle of the CNT (A1), PDA-RGO/CNT (A2), untreated PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS (A3), PDA-RGO (A4), and S1\u2013S10 films. The CNT films exhibit the highest contact angle of 108.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u00b0, whereas the PDA-RGO films have the lowest contact angle of 70.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u00b0. The contact angle of the films before and after treatment clearly changed, likely on account of the removal of the hydrophilic PSS, and the contact angle of all of the S1\u2013S10 films was higher than 82.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.9\u00b0, meaning that the films were rather hydrophobic surface, which may indicate improved the stability of TCF in air. A schematic illustration of the changes occurring in the PEDOT:PSS layer before and after treatment is shown in Fig. 8 . In the pure PEDOT:PSS layer, PEDOT and PSS are held together by ionic attraction and have a coiled or core-shell structure due to repulsion between long PSS chains (Fig. 8a). The addition of DMSO and EG-bath treatment screens the Coulombic interaction between the PEDOT and PSS chains by forming hydrogen bonding with both PEDOT and PSS, thus leading to phase separation between PEDOT and PSS. At the same time, the coil structure of the PEDOT chains transforms to a linear or expanded-coil structure (Fig. 8b). According to Ouyang\u2019s report [23], the catechol groups on the PDA-RGO sheets have two polar phenolic hydroxyl groups that may hydrogen bond to PSS chains and reinforce the screening effect (Fig. 8c). In order to further improve the optoelectronic properties, the films were treated with sulfuric acid. The effect of sulfuric acid can be understood in terms of the interaction between PSS\u2212 and H2SO4 (H2SO4+PSS-\u2192HSO4+PSSH); the PSSH chains are neutral and do not have any Coulombic interaction with PEDOT, which can lead to more removal of insulating PSS from the films (Fig. 8d). The films were annealed at 120 \u2103 for 15\u202fmin after treatment, and crystallization occurred when the water and additive solvent evaporated which enhanced the crystallinity of the film [40]. The phase separated, crystalline, and oriented PEDOT polymer chains allow more inter-chain interaction between the conducting polymers, which results in a lower energy barrier for inter-chain and interdomain charge hopping, thus enabling easier charge transfer among the PEDOT chains. Charge hopping among the polymer chains is believed to be the dominant conduction mechanism in conducting polymers. PEDOT-rich chains with improved crystallinity, preferred orientation, linear structure, larger grain size, and lower intragrain hopping promote charge hopping, which significantly enhances the conductivity. The evolution of the stability of the sheet resistance for the treated PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS film was measured as a function of bending cycle numbers and air exposure time is shown in Fig. 9 [41]. In Fig. 9a, the TCF had constant resistance at a bending radius of 10\u202fmm and bending cycle up to 1000 cycles and no cracking was observed from the surface of films, which indicated that the hybrid film was highly flexible and resistant to bending fatigue. In Fig. 9b, the gradual increase of sheet resistance of the films is most likely caused by aging effect due to exposure to moisture and oxygen in the air. However, this change is very slight, which indicates the ultra-stability of the films. In addition, the PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS TCF is connected to a light-emitting diode (LED) after an air exposure test as the picture shown in the inset in Fig. 9b, thus demonstrating the excellent conductivity of the electrode [42]. The electroluminescence characteristics of the flexible organic light emission device, which using PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS films before and after 1000 cycles bending tests as anode is shown in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10a depicts the schematic structure of the OLED, Fig. 10b and 10c show the luminance and the current efficiency of the OLED device, respectively. The luminance of the device using pristine film as anode was 2032\u202fcd/cm2 at 15\u202fV, and the maximum current efficiency was 2.13\u202fcd/A at 14\u202fV. Moreover, the device which using the film after 1000 cycles bending tests as anode also shows the same performance as the former one, indicating the reliability of the film. We believe that if further optimization is conducted, the general OLED performance could be improved.  In conclusion, we fabricated a high performance flexible transparent film by simple spray coating. The PDA-functionalized reduced graphene oxide improved the interfacial adhesion between the conductive coating layers and substrate, which leads to enhanced electrical transport properties of the hybrid films. The obtained hybrid films. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "have a relatively low rms roughness of approximately 2.41\u202fnm. In addition, significant improvement in the conductivity was achieved by implementing a novel treatment method. The mechanism generating the improved adhesion and conductivity was investigated in detail. The best results were obtained from the PDA-RGO/CNT/PEDOT:PSS-DMSO-EG bath and H2SO4 treated electrode that exhibited a sheet resistance of 52.2\u202f\u03a9/sq. with an optical transmittance of 88.7% at 550\u202fnm. OLEDs which using PDA-RGO/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS film as anode were successfully fabricated, and the luminance of the device was 2032\u202fcd/cm2 at 15\u202fV, and the maximum current efficiency was 2.13\u202fcd/A at 14\u202fV. It is believed that the developed hybrid TCF and corresponding processing technology can have wide applications for flexible electro-optic and photoelectric devices.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Numerous researchers have utilized 2D materials for different applications such as electronic and optoelectronic devices, solar cells, and water splitting catalysts [3\u20136]. Until now, extensive effort has been put into obtaining high-quality large-area 2D materials via various synthetic routes [7,8]. Of numerous synthetic methods reported so far, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) route has been considered the most promising approach to obtain high-quality uniform films over a large area [9]. In general, when using the CVD method to synthesize 2D materials, several synthetic parameters should be taken into consideration, including precursor, substrate, gas flow rate, growth temperature, growth time, as well as the distance between precursor-substrate [10,11]. Hence, through careful control of the above parameters during the synthesis process, the high-quality large-area 2D materials can be fabricated by CVD. However, when using CVD method for the growth of 2D materials, the as-synthesized 2D materials need to be transferred to other appropriate substrates as they are usually grown on metal substrates. Furthermore, obtaining clean and large-area 2D material films with desirable electrical properties after the transfer is still far from satisfaction due to many outstanding limitations incurred during the transfer process, such as unwanted impurities, structural defects, and poor surface flatness [12,13]. To overcome these outstanding issues, extensive effort has been directed towards developing novel transfer methods employing various rigid polymer supports to facilitate the transfer of 2D materials including polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), as well as rosin [14\u201321] on to arbitrary substrates. Unfortunately, these transfer methods suffer from several critical drawbacks, such as complicated transfer procedure, rough surface, and structural damages. For instance, in general, PMMA has been employed as a supporting layer for transferring 2D materials. However, the long-chain structure (the structure formula of PMMA is shown in Fig. S1a in Supporting Information), large molecular weight (~120,000) and the low solubility in chemical solvent (such as acetone) result in large amount of PMMA residues on the surface of 2D materials [21,22]. Removing PMMA via heating (generally at 50\u2013300 \u00b0C) process introduces defects or damage to the surface of 2D materials [22]. Thus, there has been great demand on developing a low-cost universal transfer technique that produces high-quality clean and large-area 2D materials surmounting these outstanding issues. Compared with PMMA, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc, as depicted in Fig. S1b in Supporting Information) has smaller molecular weight (~100,000), which can be easily removed from the surface of the 2D materials during the dissolving process. The PVAc provides excellent room-temperature solubility in chemical solvents (including acetone, methanol, and ethanol), robust support, as well as low-cost. These advantages indicate that PVAc will be an excellent supporting layer for 2D materials transfer. However, the systematic investigation of a universal transfer technique for obtaining high-quality 2D materials by using PVAc as a supporting layer has been yet reported. In this work, PVAc is used as a rigid support layer during transfer process of large area CVD-grown 2D materials onto desirable target substrates without incorporating structural and chemical damages. We demonstrate the advantages of our transfer method by applying to the large-area graphene film grown on Cu foil and h-BN film grown on Pt foil by taking unique advantages of PVAc as a rigid support. The PVAc assisted transfer technique in this work enables graphene on h-BN to achieve a high carrier mobility of up to\u00a0~\u00a010,000\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 at room temperature, indicating that the quality of the as-transferred 2D materials is not only mainly determined by the quality of the as-synthesized 2D materials, but also by defects incurred during the transfer process. The results demonstrate our transfer approach is a promising method for large scale and flexible electronics based on 2D materials.  PVAc solution was prepared by dissolving 0.6\u00a0g of PVAc powder (Sigma-Aldrich, average molecular weight: ~ 100,000, (A.R.)) in 15\u00a0ml of toluene and stirring at 80 \u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Monolayer graphene was grown on Cu foil using low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method following our previously developed synthetic method reported elsewhere [23], which is given in Supporting Information. A schematic depicting the transfer procedure of graphene using PVAc as a robust support is shown in Fig. 1 . First, the graphene/Cu foil was spin-coated with PVAc. The PVAc/graphene/Cu foil was then submerged into a solution of 0.1\u00a0M of ammonium persulfate for 10\u00a0h to etch the Cu foil. After the Cu was etched, the PVAc/graphene block was rinsed with deionized (DI) water three times and transferred onto a target substrate. The transferred PVAc/graphene was then dried for 24\u00a0h and left in air for 48\u00a0h. Finally, the PVAc was removed by dissolving in acetone at room temperature. Monolayer h-BN film was grown on Pt foil using a LPCVD method following our previously developed synthetic method reported elsewhere [3], which is provided in more detail in Supporting Information. The h-BN/Pt foil was then spin-coated with PVAc and the sample was kept in a vacuum for 24\u00a0h. After establishing vacuum, the electrochemical bubbling method was used for transferring PVAc/h-BN film onto a SiO2/Si substrate. The PVAc/h-BN/Pt foil and a pure Pt foil were used as the cathode and the anode, respectively; a NaOH aqueous solution (1.0\u00a0M) was used as the electrolyte at room temperature. The bubbling transfer method was used with a stable current level of 1 A, and the corresponding electrolytic voltage was run between 5 and 10\u00a0V and applied for 2\u20135\u00a0min. After the PVAc/h-BN film was peeled off from the Pt foil, the sample was cleaned 3 times by DI water to remove the residual NaOH solution, after which the sample was transferred onto a SiO2/Si substrate. Finally, the sample was dipped in acetone for 3\u20138\u00a0min to remove PVAc layer at room temperature. The fabrication process of graphene-based FETs is given in the following. Firstly, CVD-grown graphene was transferred onto Si/SiO2 substrates. The p-type Si substrate was utilized as the. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "back gate with a thermally oxidized 100-nm-thick SiO2 top layer as the gate oxide layer. The electrodes were then patterned on the graphene film by a conventional photolithography process. Afterward, contact electrodes were deposited using a home-made electron-beam evaporator to form Ohmic contacts. A 20-nm-thick chromium (Cr) layer was first evaporated, followed by a 50-nm-thick Au layer (Cr/Au: 20/50\u00a0nm). Field-effect mobility (\u00b5) was estimated to evaluate the electrical characteristics of the graphene-based FETs in vacuum using a probe station equipped with a Keithley SCS-4200 system. To extract the \u00b5 of the graphene, the total resistance of the device (Rtotal) was estimated using the following equation [10]: Rtotal=2Rcontact+Rchannel=2Rcontact+LWne\u03bc where Rcontact is the contact resistance between the Au drain and source electrodes and graphene, Rchannel is the resistance of the graphene channel, L is the channel length, W is the channel width, e is the electron charge, \u00b5 is the carrier mobility, and n is the carrier concentration in the graphene channel region, which can be approximated with the following equation: n=n02+nbg2=n02+[Cbg(Vbg-VDirac)/e]2 where n0 is the residual carrier concentration representing the density of carriers at the Dirac point, nbg=Cbg\u00d7Vbg-VDirac/e is the carrier concentration induced by the back-gate bias away from the Dirac point; and Cbg is the back-gate capacitance (\u03b50\u03b5SiO2/dSiO2\u224811.5 nF/cm2) [18]. To calculate \u00b5, the following equation was employed: y=a+b\u00d7(1+c\u00d7x)-12 where y=Rtotal,a=2Rcontact,b=LWCbg\u03bc,c=n02\u00d7e2Cbg2, and x=(Vbg-VDirac)2 to fit the measured data. Hence, \u00b5 can be calculated by the following equation: \u03bc=LW\u00d7b\u00d7Cbg Optical micrographs were acquired for visual inspection using optical microscopy (OM, Olympus, Olympus DX51). The surface morphology was acquired using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM7401F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F, 200\u00a0kV). The film thickness and the surface topography were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco, Dimension 3100). Raman spectra were measured using micro Raman microscopy (Renishaw, InVia Basic) with a 532-nm-wavelength laser to investigate the structural quality. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi) were performed with an Mg K\u03b1 X-ray source on the samples.  Schematic illustrating the PVAc assisted transfer of CVD-grown graphene on Cu foil is provided in Fig. 1. Firstly, PVAc was coated on graphene/Cu foil; secondly, the Cu foil was etched using 0.1\u00a0M of ammonium persulfate; graphene film was then transferred onto the target substrate. To more effectively demonstrate that our transfer method can be used for an effective transfer of large area 2D materials, we transferred the graphene film with a size of 8\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0cm by using PVAc, as shown in Fig. S2 (Supporting Information). Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy characterizations of graphene. The quality of the transfer process for each sample was characterized with OM, SEM and Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows the OM, SEM images and Raman spectra of the graphenes transferred onto 300-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrates by using PMMA and PVAc as support layers, respectively. As evident from Fig. 2a and 2b, the OM and SEM images reveal numerous PMMA residues which makes graphene defective and rough. Compared with Fig. 2a and 2b, the PVAc assisted transfer method (Fig. 2d and 2e) produces graphene that has a clean and uniform surface. Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the quality and to determine the number of graphene layers [23]. Fig. 2c and 2f show the Raman spectra of graphene films transferred via PMMA and PVAc onto 300-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrate, respectively. A defect peak (i.e., D peak) that appears in Fig. 2c (via PMMA assisted transfer method), indicates a poor-quality of graphene [24,25]. As presented in Fig. 2f, the Raman spectra did not exhibit D peak, suggesting high-quality graphene film can be easily obtained by the PVAc assisted transfer method. In addition, the intensity ratio of I2D/IG is over 2, indicating that the monolayer graphene film is synthesized. AFM, TEM and optical transmittance of graphene. The surface roughness and microstructure of the transferred graphene films were further investigated by AFM and TEM. Fig. 3 a shows the AFM image of graphene transferred via PMMA as a support layer, which reveals that numerous PMMA residual particles were observed on the graphene surface. Compared with this conventional PMMA-assisted transfer method, PVAc transferred graphene as revealed in the AFM image (Fig. 3b) exhibits a clean and uniform surface, which is in good agreement with OM and SEM images. The TEM images (Fig. 3c and d) of the as-transferred samples via PMMA and PVAc, also exhibit that PVAc assisted transfer method results in high-quality and uniform graphene film. The optical transmittance of the as-synthesized samples was also examined under flat and bending states (Fig. 3e) to demonstrate the optical quality of the transferred samples. The as-transferred samples were investigated over the visible light wavelength range from 400 to 800\u00a0nm, as shown in Fig. 3f. We found that the PVAc transferred graphene has a better optical transmittance (96.2%) than that of the PMMA assisted transferred graphene (94.7%). Raman mapping and XPS characterizations of graphene. The Raman mapping was taken to further investigate the quality of graphene films, and the G and 2D bands were measured over an area of 80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a080\u00a0\u00b5m2 at 200 different locations. As can be seen, the Raman mapping of PMMA transferred graphene film (Fig. 4 a and 4b), reveals that the G and 2D bands positions have a range from 1590 to1596, and 2684 to 2690\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. On the other hand, the PVAc transferred graphene (Fig. 4c and 4d) shows that the G and 2D bands appear between 1591 and 1593\u00a0cm\u22121, and between 2686 and 2688\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively. This observation indicates that the G and 2D bands of graphene via PVAc assisted transfer method has a smaller range than those of graphene via PMMA assisted transfer method. Hence, the quality of graphene transferred using PVAc is better than that of graphene transferred using PMMA. We also employed XPS to investigate the elemental compositions of graphene surface obtained via PMMA and PVAc assisted transfer methods. As shown in Fig. 4e, a peak at 288.7\u00a0eV is attributed to the PMMA residue particles [21]. Compared with PMMA assisted transfer method, no other peaks were. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "observed from the graphene transferred via the PVAc assisted transfer method (Fig. 4f), demonstrating that the surface of the PVAc transferred graphene is clean and of high quality. Hence, we can confirm that the PVAc is a promising material for transfer of CVD-grown 2D materials on to any desirable substrates. Table 1 summarizes the properties of PVAc and other polymers employed as supporting layers for transferring CVD-grown graphene. OM, SEM, Raman spectra and AFM characterizations of h-BN. To demonstrate universal applicability of our transfer method, we explored our transfer technique to transfer the CVD-grown h-BN film on Pt foil onto target substrates in combination with a bubbling method. Fig. 5 presents the OM, SEM, Raman spectra and AFM images of the h-BN film transferred onto a 300-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrate by using PMMA and PVAc assisted transfer methods. Compared with PMMA assisted transfer method, the OM (Fig. 5a and e) and SEM (Fig. 5b and f) images indicate that PVAc assisted transfer method results in a higher quality h-BN film with a clean and uniform surface. The Raman spectra of PMMA assisted transfer method display a red shift, while the PVAc transfer method presents a narrower and sharper peak of h-BN film, suggesting h-BN film is of a high quality (Fig. 5c and 5\u00a0g). The AFM images (Fig. 5d and h) for both PMMA and PVAc assisted transfer methods are presented for comparison. The result demonstrates that h-BN film transferred using PVAc shows an ultra-uniform surface. Based on the above results, we conclude the quality of h-BN transferred using PVAc is far better than that of h-BN transferred using PMMA. Electrical transport properties of graphene. To investigate the electrical characteristics of the graphene transferred by different transfer methods, we fabricated graphene-based FETs (GFETs) with 40\u00a0\u03bcm long and 10\u00a0\u03bcm wide conduction channels by transferring the graphene onto a 100-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrate with Cr/Au (20/50\u00a0nm) as the source and the drain electrodes, respectively. The heavily doped p-type Si (~1020/cm3) substrate is used as the bottom gate that modulates the charge density in the conduction channel of graphene. The GFETs made of PVAc transferred graphene on h-BN, PVAc transferred graphene on SiO2, PVA transferred graphene on SiO2, and PMMA transferred graphene on SiO2 are prepared respectively, to evaluate their electrical characteristics following the standard photolithographic process described earlier. The resistivity (\u03c1) and gate voltage (Vg) curves for all GFETs are shown in Fig. 6 a. For GFETs employing graphene/h-BN transferred using PVAc, the mobility values of up to 10,000\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 are obtained, whereas the mobility values of GFETs employing graphene transferred using PVAc, PVA and PMMA onto SiO2 substrates reach up to 9,200, 7600 and 5250\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. It should be noted that the carrier mobility values of the GFET employing graphene/h-BN transferred onto SiO2 using PVAc are higher than those of graphene transferred via PMMA and PVA onto SiO2, which is due to the fact that PVAc has an excellent solubility in chemical solvents compared with PMMA and PVA, resulting in graphene having a clean and uniform surface (please see Fig. 2d, e and 3b, d). It should be noteworthy that the mobility values observed in our devices are at least 2\u20134 times higher than those for CVD-grown graphene reported elsewhere [26\u201336]. To demonstrate that our PVAc assisted transfer method exhibits a reliable performance, we measured 100 devices employing graphene transferred by each polymer medium. Fig. 6b shows the 3D histogram of the carrier mobility of the graphene FETs prepared via each transfer method following the same device fabrication procedure. This result indicates that the graphene/h-BN transferred via PVAc has much higher charge mobilities up to\u00a0~\u00a010,000\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 with much narrower distribution having smaller standard deviation compared to those of the graphenes transferred via other transfer methods. Table 2 summarizes the maximum, minimum, average values and standard deviation of charge mobilities of GFETs prepared via each transfer method. Our findings strongly indicate that the transfer of 2D materials using PVAc as a rigid support for 2D materials during the transfer process is very effective and practical for constructing high-performance electrical and tunneling devices, and provides many advantages compared with PMMA or other assisted transfer method.  We developed an effective transfer method that enables large-area 2D materials such as graphene and h-BN to be reliably transferred onto target substrates via PVAc as a rigid support layer. The PVAc provides many advantages, including an excellent room-temperature solubility in chemical solvents such as acetone, methanol, or ethanol, a robust support, clean surface of 2D materials after PVAc layer is removed, as well as low-cost. Compared with PMMA and PVA assisted transfer methods, the PVAc assisted transfer technique produces graphene/h-BN that exhibits a high carrier mobility (~10,000\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) at room temperature. This exceptional result demonstrates that our work could offer a unique opportunity not only for the development of high-performance electronic devices based on 2D materials film but also for fundamental study.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

To date, most of the research on fuel-forming reactions has been mainly focused on functionalized inorganic semiconductors, including oxides , sulfides , oxynitrides and phosphates , used as photocatalysts , but only a few of them are considered to be suitable materials for effective photocatalysts that can operate the reactions efficiently with adequate lifetimes. With the goal of improving photoelectrochemical energy conversion, the development of modified well-known semiconductors such as TiO2 as catalysts by metal loading , metal iondoping , or dye sensitization is greatly needed. As an alternative, a new class of visible light-active solids could be sought out for this application . Recently, several organic polymeric materials including poly(p-phenylene) , graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) , polyimide , poly(azomethine) and C3N3S3-polymer have been demonstrated to be active for water reduction, but most of these materials exhibited obviously lower values for their photocatalytic effectiveness than those of conditioned heterogeneous photocatalysts. From the material design point of view, the band structure of organic solids can be directly tuned in these molecules by wise structural adjustment in the organic motifs associated with the charge transfer process, which is the key step in performing light-to-energy conversion. Organic molecular light-capturing materials have been widely used in both dye-sensitized solar cells and homogeneous photocatalytic water reduction systems . However, the possible application of simple organic molecular solids as photocatalysts for the light-driven generation of hydrogen in a heterogeneous system has rarely been considered. Pentacenequinone derivatives are used as n-type organic semiconductors in organic thin film transistor devices due to their unique electronic properties . A recent study has shown that 6,13-pentacenequinone (PQ) (Scheme 1 ) is photocatalytically active for H2S splitting under visible light irradiation . Compared with H2S cleavage, the energy required to drive photocatalytic water splitting is much higher . Therefore, the development of a new system based on PQ for the production of valuable fuels through the utilization of an extensive variety of water sources is of special importance. It has been demonstrated that the deposition of suitable cocatalysts on the catalyst particles exerts an impressive impact on upgrading the effectiveness of catalysts for the generation of hydrogen from water . Currently, precious metal species such as Pt are widely considered as effective co-catalysts in promoting the evolution of hydrogen . The catalytic performance of the cocatalysts in such a photocatalytic system strongly depends on their chemical and physical characteristics such as particle size, dispersibility, contact with photocatalysts, valence states and so on. For widespread application, the utilization of non-noble metal alternatives with high efficiencies and low costs is particularly attractive. Recently, graphene-like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has proven to be an impressive and appealing catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction , most likely due to the presence of the exposed active edge sites that offer highly accessible reactive sites . Layered MoS2 alone is not generally a viable photocatalyst for hydrogen production in the absence of any other semiconductor or photosensitizer , despite the fact that it absorbs very effectively at visible wavelengths, which is likely because of insufficient charge separation. Several promising examples of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and organic dye degradation using MoS2 as an efficient cocatalyst have appeared, but the effect of a cocatalyst based on MoS2 on the catalytic performance remains less understood. Herein, we first demonstrate that PQ can effectively catalyze hydrogen production from water with the help of a MoS2 nanoparticle cocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Moreover, our results show that MoS2 has a good performance as a cocatalyst that exceeds that of Pt metal for photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. This study presents a new inorganic\u2013organic photocatalytic composite material for solar-to-hydrogen conversion.  All of the chemical reagents were used as supplied without further purification. For cyclic voltammetry measurements, anhydrous acetonitrile was supplied by Alfa Aesar, and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AMX500 MHZ FT NMR spectrometer. Analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C element analyzer. UV\u2013vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy experiments were performed with a Varian Cary 50 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer, and BaSO4 was used as a reference standard. The photoluminescence emission spectra and luminescence lifetimes were measured at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3-21-TCSPC). Electrochemical properties were measured with a PARSTAT-2273 advanced electrochemical system. The nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm was obtained by nitrogen physisorption at 77 K on a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics TriStar, USA), and the surface area was calculated by the BET method. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was achieved on a NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal analysis system with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min\u22121. The nanoscale images of PQ were obtained using a JEOL JEM-200CX transmission electron microscope or a NOVA NANOSEM230 scanning electron microscope. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet-Nexus 870 infrared spectrophotometer by using the KBr pellet technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were obtained on a D/MAX-2500 automatic powder diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.1542 nm) flux at a scanning rate of 5\u00b0 min\u22121 in the 2\u03b8 range of 10\u201380\u00b0. The Raman spectra of samples were acquired on a Renishaw Raman microscope spectrometer (RM-1000, Great Britain) under 785 nm diode laser excitation. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer using a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 radiation. PQ was synthesized by a modified method according to a previously reported procedure . In a 100 mL reaction flask, o-phthaldialdehyde (2.68 g, 20 mmol) and 1,4-cyclohexanedione (1.12 g, 10 mmol) were dispersed in 15 mL of water by ultrasound. A 15-mL aliquot of KOH (15 wt%) solution was added to the mixture with continuous magnetic stirring to induce the precipitation of a yellow solid. The solid product was then filtered out, washed by water (3\u00d7 20 mL). but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "and washed by acetone (3\u00d7 20 mL) to remove the unreacted reactants (yield: 62%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, \u03b4): 8.99 (4H, s), 8.18 (4H, d, J = 7.5), 7.73 (4H, t, J = 8).

The MoS2/PQ composites were prepared via a two-step procedure. First, the nano-structured MoS2 was prepared by a reported hydrothermal reaction of sodium molybdate dehydrate and thiourea . Secondly, the MoS2/PQ composites loaded with various amounts of MoS2 were prepared in a similar method. In a typical synthesis of the 0.5 wt% MoS2/PQ composite, 0.50 mg of MoS2 was dispersed under magnetic stirring in 50 mL of aqueous solution containing 100 mg of PQ, and then the mixture was shaken in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h to form a suspension. The resulting mixture was centrifuged, and the separated solid was rinsed with water followed by drying at 80 \u00b0C overnight. Finally, the sample was heat-treated at 300 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was recorded under a nitrogen atmosphere with a scan rate of 50 mV s\u22121 using a three-electrode system consisting of Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, a platinum sheet as the counter electrode, and a glassy carbon disk as the working electrode. The supporting electrode was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile. The J\u2013V curve was recorded on a CHI-B600 electrochemical analyzer, and the light source was a 300 W Xe lamp. Photoelectrochemical experiment was performed using a three-electrode cell configuration of the photo-anode (working electrode), Pt sheet (counter electrode) and Ag/AgCl electrode (reference electrode) in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. The photoanodes of PQ or other composite samples were prepared by spin coating a saturated dichloromethane solution of PQ or MoS2/PQ (1 mg mL\u22121) on ITO glass, which was then heated at 300 \u00b0C for 4 h. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions were carried out at room temperature in a Pyrex vessel, which was connected to a glass closed gas circulation and evacuation system. The experiment was performed by dispersing MoS2/PQ powder (100 mg) in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing triethanolamine (0.2 M) as a sacrificial electron donor. The pH value of the solution was adjusted by the addition of 38 wt% hydrochloric acid. The reaction solution was evacuated several times to completely remove any air. After evacuation, the mixture was exposed to visible irradiation (\u03bb > 420 nm) using a Xenon lamp (300 W equipped with a cut-off filter) with gentle magnetic stirring. The gases being evolved were periodically detected in situ on a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC-8A, argon as the carrier gas and a MS-5A column). The density functional theory calculations (B3LYP/LANL2DZ) for PQ were performed using Gaussian 09 package . The numerical calculations in this paper were performed on the IBM Blade cluster system at the High Performance Computing Center (HPCC) of Nanjing University.  The MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst was obtained via an easy two-step method (see Section 2). PQ was first synthesized by a method modified from a previously reported procedure and was full characterized by 1H NMR, XRD, FT-IR and elemental analysis. The sample seems to be insoluble in water but soluble in polar organic solvents such as dichloromethane, acetonitrile and acetone. The structure of PQ powder was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of PQ particles shows that the square-shaped particles are closely packed together in the solid (Fig. S1, see Supporting information). The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) specific surface area of PQ was determined to be approximately 10.6 m2 g\u22121 (Fig. S2). Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that PQ is thermally stable up to approximately 360 \u00b0C (Fig. S3). The strong intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions in PQ may impart this good thermal stability. The photophysical properties and redox behavior of PQ are in very good agreement with the published data . As indicated by the yellow color of PQ, an optical absorption edge in the range of visible light is observed in a CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. S4), which is associated with the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) (Fig. S5). Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the HOMO is localized mainly on the aromatic ring moiety, while the LUMO corresponds to a mixture of the dione moiety with a minor contribution from the aromatic ring moiety. The electronic redistribution clearly implies that a significant intramolecular charge separation between the HOMO and LUMO levels could easily occur. Under the illumination of visible light (\u03bb > 420 nm, 300 W), the PQ layer coated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass plates can generate a photocurrent of ca. 2 \u03bcA/cm2 in a 0.50 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (Fig. S6), indicating that an efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers occurred. This value is close to that of bulk g-C3N4 . The MoS2 nanosheets, as the other precursor for the fabrication of the MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst, were obtained from a reported hydrothermal method . The MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst was made via the ultrasonic dispersion of nanocrystalline powders of MoS2 in water with the addition of PQ, followed by sintering up to 300 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1 , the XRD spectrum of PQ power displays main diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 = 14.6\u00b0, 23.6\u00b0 and 27.6\u00b0. Referring to the literature, these peaks correspond to the reflections from the (0 1 2), (1 1 2) and (1 0 4) planes (JCPDS, 47-2123) , respectively. The good crystalline quality of the sample was confirmed by the sharpness and high intensities of the diffraction peaks. As for the pure nanostructured MoS2 particles, the XRD pattern of the pure and poorly crystallized MoS2 reveals distinct characteristic peaks at 14.0\u00b0, 33.5\u00b0, 38.8\u00b0 and 58.1\u00b0 corresponding to diffraction from the (0 0 2), (1 0 0), (1 0 3). but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "and (1 1 0) lattice planes of the hexagonal MoS2 phase (JCPDS card no: 87-2416, molybdenum disulfide 2H) , as shown in Fig. S7. However, no diffraction peaks attributed to the MoS2 species were observed in the XRD spectrum of the MoS2/PQ composite due to the small MoS2 content and its high dispersion on the surface of PQ that existed in the MoS2/PQ composites. Similar behaviors were also observed in other MoS2-based composites . Meanwhile, Raman spectra of pure MoS2 and MoS2/PQ composites were investigated to confirm the maintained 2H-MoS2 structure after coating the PQ surfaces with MoS2. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the pure MoS2 nanosheets show two typical peaks at 382 and 401 cm\u22121, which can be assigned to the in-plane E 1 2g vibration and the out-of-plane A 1g vibration of the hexagonal MoS2, respectively. For the MoS2/PQ composites, no peaks of MoS2 can be seen in the Raman spectra of both the 0.50 and 1.00 wt% MoS2/PQ composites. For the 2.00 wt% MoS2/PQ composite, the presence of weaker and broader E 2g and A 1g characteristic peaks indicates that the layered MoS2 was coated on the surface of PQ. Further composition analysis using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the presence of MoS2 in the MoS2/PQ composites. A HRTEM image of the 2.0 wt% MoS2/PQ composite illustrates that MoS2 with its typical layered structure (Fig. 2 ), in which the lattice spacing is approximately 0.61 nm corresponding to the (0 0 2) plane of hexagonal MoS2 , is deposited on the surface of PQ. An intimate interface between MoS2 and PQ formed in the composites, which may provide a beneficial effect on the charge transfer between MoS2 and PQ. From the high resolution XPS spectra of the 2.0 wt% MoS2/PQ composite shown in Fig. 3 , two peaks are present at 228.8 eV (3d5/2) and 232.3 eV (3d3/2) for Mo, and two peaks at 162.2 eV (2p3/2) and 163.3 eV (2p1/2) are also present in the S 2P region. This indicates that Mo and S are present in Mo4+ and S2\u2212 valence states . Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra of samples of PQ and MoS2/PQ composites with different MoS2 contents. The PQ shows semiconductor-like band gap absorption at 455 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 2.76 eV. Loading PQ with MoS2 imparts a distinct red shift and an increase of the absorption band in the visible light region, which depicts a good interaction between MoS2 and PQ. Additionally, it clearly shows that the light-harvesting ability of the composite strengthens with increasing amounts of MoS2, which is also consistent with the fact that the color of the samples changed from yellow to gray. We then evaluated the photocatalytic activity of PQ in the context of hydrogen production. The studies were carried out in 100 mL of aqueous solution using TEOA as an electron donor under the illumination of visible light (\u03bb > 420 nm). However, although PQ could absorb visible light, no H2 evolution was detected under these conditions. After the MoS2 nanosheets were loaded as H2 evolution sites on the PQ surface, the formation of hydrogen was clearly observed. The control experiment showed that no hydrogen evolution was obtained in the dark, indicating that the evolution of H2 is initiated by light. Based on these results, it is reasonable to conclude that the MoS2-loaded PQ composite (MoS2/PQ) has the capacity to catalyze the reduction of water under visible light. Fig. 5 shows a plot of the variation in the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of PQ samples loaded with different amounts of MoS2 cocatalyst, and it indicates that the photocatalytic performance of PQ is greatly influenced by the MoS2 loading amount. These results showed that the rate of hydrogen evolution initially increased with increasing MoS2 content, reached a maximum at 0.5 wt% MoS2 and then decreased upon a further increase in the MoS2 loading amount. This result consisted with the observation in photoelectrochemical response of the MoS2/PQ composite photoelectrodes (Fig. S8). With a low loading amount of 0.25 wt% MoS2, the photocatalyst showed a H2 evolution rate of 50.5 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121. When the loading amount of MoS2 was increased to 0.5 wt%, the H2 evolution rate was observed to be 79.5 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121. With the enhancement of the MoS2 loading amount to 2.0 wt%, the H2 evolution rate decreased to 25.8 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121. When the loading amount of MoS2 is less than 0.5 wt%, the photocatalytic activity of the MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst increased with increasing MoS2 loading amounts, which can be attributed to the increasing number of active catalytic sites on the MoS2 for the water reduction reaction. However, a further increase in the MoS2 loading amount to 1.5 or 2.0 wt% resulted in a decreased hydrogen evolution rate compared to the rate at a loading of 0.25 wt%. With increasing amounts of MoS2, the color of the composite photocatalyst changed from yellow to gray. The introduction of a large amount of the black MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of the PQ shielded the incident light from irradiating into the inside of the PQ light absorber, resulting in a decreased H2 evolution rate. A similar observation has been encountered in previous studies . When the pure unmodified MoS2 nanosheets were used alone as a photocatalyst under identical experimental conditions, there was no appreciable hydrogen evolved under visible light irradiation, which is probably related to the surface properties of the catalyst. This observation is consistent with those previously reported in the study of the photocatalytic properties of MoS2 . We noted the MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst shows a lower photocatalytic activity than those of inorganic/inorganic composite photocatalysts such as MoS2/TiO2 (1.6 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121) or MoS2/CdS (5.4 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121) , but its activity is comparable to those of inorganic/organic composite photocatalysts such as MoS2/C3N4 (17.8 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121) . For inorganic compound-based composite photocatalysts, an intimate interface between the two components in. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the heterostructures facilitates the charge transfer and thus restrains their recombination by coupling two well-matched overlapping semiconductor band structures, leading to the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 production activity. Whereas, it is difficult to create effective interfacial contacts between PQ and MoS2 due to the different physical characteristics of resilient organic and hard inorganic compounds, leading to the lower photocatalytic activity of the MoS2/PQ composite photocatalyst relative to related inorganic composite photocatalysts. To further optimize the performance of the MoS2/PQ photocatalyst, the effects of the pH value on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity were also investigated using 0.5 wt% MoS2/PQ photocatalyst (Fig. 6 ). The rate of light-induced H2 evolution was found to depend on the pH value when it was varied from 5.0 to 9.0. A maximum rate of H2 production was observed at a pH of 7.0, and lower rates were obtained when either lower or higher pH values were used. The decrease in the rate of H2 evolution at higher pH values is likely a result of a lower proton concentration in the reaction solution; moreover, when the pH value of the bulk solution is increased, the thermodynamic driving force for proton reduction is lower. Conversely, lowering the pH value from 7.0 to 5.0 leads to the protonation of TEOA, which is an ineffective sacrificial electron donor. The maximal H2 generation rate was observed at a neutral pH. This phenomenon could be attributed to a balance between the benefit of the higher proton concentration at a low pH value and the need for TEOA as an electron donor for PQ regeneration at a high pH value. To promote charge separation and extract the photogenerated electrons, the noble metal Pt cocatalyst has often been used in such a reductive reaction due to its large work function and relatively low overpotential for catalyzing the desired reaction at the desired rate . For comparison, Pt cocatalyst was used instead of MoS2 under our experimental conditions. When using K2PtCl4 as a precursor, the Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were loaded as H2 evolution sites in situ on the PQ surface by the photodeposition method, which clearly resulted in the observable formation of hydrogen. As shown in Table 1 , the H2 evolution activity of PQ was also dependent on the Pt cocatalyst loading amount. The highest H2 evolution rate of 53.2 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121 was obtained with 3.0 wt% Pt/PQ composite photocatalyst. Furthermore, the particle size of the Pt NPs deposited on the PQ was confirmed by TEM after 24 h of irradiation. A typical TEM image of the Pt NPs is shown in Fig. S9, which shows a fine dispersion of approximately 3- to 5-nm-diameter Pt NPs on the surface of PQ. The observed size of the Pt NPs makes them applicable for use as a cocatalyst in photocatalytic H2 generation . The results indicate that MoS2 is more effective as a cocatalyst than Pt under the reaction conditions, which may be related to the effective intimate surface formed between MoS2 and PQ, as shown by the HRTEM image. The stability of the H2 evolution system was also examined by operating the photoinduced H2 evolution experiment three consecutive times under the same reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 , the amounts of H2 produced in the photocatalytic system based on a 0.5 wt% MoS2-loaded PQ sample increased steadily with a prolonged light irradiation time. The catalyst was reused for the three successive trials for a cumulative time of 12 h without a considerable decrease in the efficiency of the catalyst. A similar stability study was carried on a 3.0 wt% Pt-loaded PQ sample, as shown in Fig. S10. It is worth noting that no obvious change in the material structure was observed for PQ after 72 h of irradiation, which was confirmed by the XRD and FTIR examinations (Figs. S11 and S12). Therefore, the photochemical stability of PQ is acceptable for light-induced hydrogen evolution. The exact reaction process still remains highly uncertain, and the possible mechanisms for the reaction are illustrated in Fig. 8 . The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction with MoS2 as a cocatalyst may favor proceeding via a Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway as discussed in a previous report . Upon excitation, an excited PQ molecule is created. Such an excited state as a strong reduction potential, which can be estimated by spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations (Figs. S13 and S14). The value of the excited state oxidation potential (E ox*) of PQ (\u22120.83 V vs. NHE) is more negative than the redox potential of protons [E(H+/H2) = \u22120.41 V vs. NHE at a pH 7], which suggests that there would be enough driving force for the reduction of protons to yield H2 (Fig. S15). However, the reduction of water with the evolution of hydrogen failed to occur when using PQ alone, which was most likely because of both the fast recombination of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs in PQ and the high overpotential of the water reduction reaction . MoS2 has a suitable redox potential, which is less negative than the H+/H2 potential and more positive than the CB of PQ , allowing it to be exploited as an efficient cocatalyst to facilitate an efficient water-splitting chemical reaction. In the meantime, the high H2 activation capability of MoS2 has been verified to be beneficial for hydrogen production . After loading MoS2 on the PQ surface, the photogenerated electrons were transferred from the excited state PQ to MoS2, where the electrons subsequently combine with the adsorbed H+ ions in water to yield H2. In the process, the MoS2 cocatalyst acts as photocatalytic reaction centers leading to efficient interfacial charge transfer . This efficient charge transfer prevents recombination and thus is responsible for the unique H2 production activity of MoS2/PQ composite photocatalysts. To investigate the photo-induced electron transfer between composites, the steady-state and time-resolved luminescence spectra of PQ in the absence and presence of MoS2 were measured. As shown in Fig. 9 , photoluminescence spectra reveal that the as-prepared neat PQ and all of the MoS2/PQ. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "composite catalysts show only one type of luminescence peaks in the recorded spectra, and the luminescence quenching of PQ takes place in the presence of MoS2 at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The luminescence intensity decreased with an increase in the amount of MoS2, indicating that the unwanted charge recombination process can be suppressed by the presence of MoS2. In addition, neat PQ has an excited state lifetime of 16 ns at room temperature, and the lifetime of PQ is quenched resulting in a shorter lifetime when the MoS2 was loaded onto the surface of PQ. From the luminescence decay curves, it is evident that the excited electrons from PQ have been readily transferred to the MoS2 cocatalyst, thus effectively enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron/hole pairs. The lowest luminescence intensity and the shortest lifetime of the 2.0 wt% MoS2-loaded PQ sample indicated that the recombination of charge carriers was minimized, but it did not show the best photocatalytic activity. The reason behind this finding has been discussed before. Such an improvement in the separation efficiency should contribute to an improved photocatalytic activity . Therefore, this new type of MoS2/PQ composite catalyst shows potential as a novel functional inorganic/organic hybrid material for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and indicates that inorganic/organic hybrid materials offer promising strategies to obtain artificial materials with these promising properties.  In this contribution, the light-driven water reduction of PQ has been achieved with the aid of a MoS2 cocatalyst and TEOA as a sacrificial electron donor under visible light irradiation. The MoS2 loading amount significantly affected the photocatalytic behavior of the MoS2/PQ composite catalysts. The PQ sample with a loading of 0.5 wt% MoS2 afforded the best catalytic performance and allowed for a H2 generation rate of 79.5 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121 at a pH of 7.0 with good stability. Moreover, MoS2 appears to be more effective than Pt as a cocatalyst when loaded on PQ for hydrogen production. The results represent a potential and prospective application of molecular organic materials for energy conversion and will generate interest in the development of more efficient and stable organic solids for storing solar energy in the form of chemical fuels.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

And it is produced in large quantities about millions of tons (>4\u202f\u00d7\u202f107\u202ft) annually as an undesirable waste from natural or anthropic processes, such as oil refining, natural gas extraction [1\u20134]. Therefore, the quest for suitable approach to realize waste H2S removal is crucial to the environment remediation and human beings. Various methods have been proposed to realize the decomposition of H2S, such as thermal (chemical), (photo) electrochemical, plasmochemical and photocatalytic methods [5\u201310]. Among them, photocatalytic technology is considered as one of the most promising methods, because the waste H2S gas decomposition and clean energy (H2) production can be simultaneously realized [11\u201313]. However, the low photocatalytic efficiency is still challenging. Therefore, in recent years, several photocatalysts have been developed to this field, including metal oxides and metal sulfides, et al. [14\u201317]. Among these photocatalysts, metal sulfide is regarded as a promising photocatalyst for H2 production from H2S due to its relatively stable property in the presence of H2S. Manganese sulfide (MnS) has aroused considerable interest in optoelectric devices, solar cell and photocatalysis owing to its unique electronic and magneto-optical properties [18\u201320]. However, its alone use as a photocatalyst in photocatalytic H2 evolution has been few considered, because of its wide band gap (Eg\u202f\u2248\u202f3.7\u202feV) and fast charge carrier recombination [10]. To address these drawbacks, various strategies, such as constructing heterojunction [10,21,22], formation solid solution [23,24], and using cocatalysts [25\u201327], were proposed. Among them, loading cocatalysts on the catalyst surface is confirmed as a promising strategy. Graphene holds great promise for potential applications in many technological fields such as nanoelectronics, sensors, nanocomposites, batteries, supercapacitors and hydrogen storage due to its two-dimensional carbon nanostructure [28,29]. But pristine graphene possesses a weak interaction with other materials for its perfect bonding condition of carbon atoms. Graphene oxide (GO), a derivative of graphene with possessing various oxygen-containing groups on its basal planes and edges, which provide lots of unsaturated bonds for coupling with other materials by forming strong interfacial contact bond [30], is widely utilized in photoelectrical devices [31\u201333], photocatalytic field especially to act as a cocatalyst to disperse and stabilize semiconductors for enhancing activity of pristine semiconductor [34\u201337]. For example, Peng et al. [37] fabricated GO/CdS nanocomposites via a facile precipitation approach. The GO/CdS composites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity because GO can serve as supporting matrix, cocatalyst and electron trapper. In addition, MnOx was widely used as a cocatalyst for hole collecting [38\u201340]. Maeda et al. [38] modified GaN:ZnO-Rh/Cr2O3 (core/shell) nanoparticles with Mn3O4 and promoted the water splitting efficiency by using Mn3O4 as O2 evolution promoters. However, the single cocatalyst is difficult to realize the hole and electron simultaneously transferred from catalyst surface to cocatalyst. Recently, Zhang et al. [41] reported that NaTaO3 with Ni/NiO dual cocatalysts with superior H2 evolution performance, in which Ni and NiO act as electron and hole collectors, respectively. Therefore, if both GO and MnOx can be simultaneously attach on photocatalyst surface, the superior photoinduced charges separation ability could be realized, which is crucial to enhance the photocatalytic performance of MnS. In the present work, a series of GO/MnS-Mn3O4 dual cocatalyst system were successfully synthesized by a mild method. The Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirmed that GO was successfully coupled. More importantly, the introduction of GO can induce the formation of the hole scavenger Mn3O4. As a result, the GO/MnS-Mn3O4 dual cocatalyst system exhibited an enhanced solar-light absorption and improved charge separation efficiency, and thus resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity. The GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composite with optimized composition exhibits 6 folds improvement in H2S-to-H2 activity over pure MnS. The factors, influencing the photocatalytic H2 production performance of GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composite like reaction pH, amount of photocatalyst used and sacrificial concentration, etc. are studied. Additionally, the function of S and photocatalytic H2S splitting mechanism are also investigated. All in all, this research provides a simple GO-induced strategy to construct dual cocatalyst system to enhance the photocatalytic property of pristine semiconductor.  The GO was prepared following the previously reported method [42]. Highly crystalline MnS nanoparticles were synthetized by a solvothermal method. 2\u202fmmol Mn (Ac)2\u00b74H2O and 9\u202fmmol thioacetamide (TAA) were dissolved in 25\u202fmL pyridine solution and then the transparent solution was transferred to a 50\u202fmL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave for heating 18\u202fh in 180\u202f\u00b0C. After centrifuging and washing the suspension repeatedly with ultrapure water and ethanol for several times, drying at 60\u202f\u00b0C in a vacuum oven for 10\u202fh, the green powder was collected. A mild stirring method was conducted to prepare GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composites. Firstly, 15\u202fmL solution with different GO solution with ultrasonic for 3\u202fh was added to 10\u202fmL MnS suspension solution to form a mixture under stirring condition and with continue stirring for another 24\u202fh. Secondly, the aforementioned mixture was treated by a freeze-drying progress for 48\u202fh then the GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composites were obtained. For convenience, the GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composites were denoted as GMx, x\u202f=\u202f1, 3, 5, representing the mass ratio of GO to MnS are 1\u202fwt%, 3\u202fwt% and 5\u202fwt%, respectively. For comparison, the as-fabricated MnS was treated through the same procedure without adding GO. The phase structure and crystallinity of the samples were determined by PANalytical X'pert powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation operated at 40\u202fkV/40\u202fmA. UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV\u2013vis DRS) were recorded at room temperature on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. XPS measurement was conducted to investigate the surface chemical composition and binding environment of samples referenced to the C 1s level at 284.8\u202feV. TEM (Tecnai G2\u202fF30) tests were carried out to investigate the microstructure of samples. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to obtain elemental mapping. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were tested with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Nicolet 6700, excitation at 380\u202fnm). The Raman spectra of samples were analyzed on a micro-Raman 2000 system. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were conducted in a standard three-electrode system on an electrochemical working station (CHI660E), using the sample film prepared. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "by a doctor-blade method on ITO glass with an active area of ca. 1\u202fcm2 as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode. Irradiation proceeded by a Xe-lamp through a UV-cutoff filter (\u03bb\u202f>\u202f420\u202fnm) and a 0.5\u202fM Na2SO3 solution was used as the electrolyte. The photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a home-made Pyrex-flask photoreactor. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 2.5\u202fmg samples were added into the 50\u202fmL photoreactor containing 5\u202fmmol Na2S\u00b79H2O and 30\u202fmmol Na2SO3 in solution. Then the reactor was purged with Ar for 10\u202fmin and followed 0.15\u202fmol H2S was bubbled into the photoreactor lasted for 3\u202fh. Finally, the reactor was illuminated by a 300\u202fW Xe lamp with a cutoff filter (\u03bb\u202f>\u202f420\u202fnm). The amount of produced H2 was monitored using gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010Plus, TCD detector, Ar as the carrier gas, 5\u202f\u00c5 molecular sieve column). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2) the related parameters include the irradiated time (t), irradiation area (S), power of the light source (P), wavelength of the light (\u03bb) and the amount of H2. h stands for the Planck constant (6.63\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221234\u202fJ\u00b7s), and c is the speed of light (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f108\u202fm/s). During our test, the irradiation time t is 1\u202fh and the irradiation area is 0.19\u202fcm2. The number of incident photons at different wavelength was determined from the output of a monochromatic LED lamp with different intensity. AQE=numberofhydrogenmolecules\u00d72numberofincidentphotons\u00d7100% numberofincidentphotons=P\u00d7S\u00d7t\u00d7\u03bbh\u00d7c  To confirm the crystal phase of these samples, XRD tests were conducted, as shown in Fig. 1 . First, graphene oxide (GO) shows the characteristic peak at around 2\u03b8\u202f=\u202f9.8\u00b0, which is indexed to (002) reflection plane with an interlayer spacing of ~8.9\u202f\u00c5 (Fig. 1(a)) [43]. In addition, in the absence of GO, the diffraction peaks can be indexed into cubic of MnS (JCPDS-06-0518) [10]. No diffraction peaks of GO are observed in GMx (x\u202f=\u202f1, 3, 5) composites after coupling GO with MnS, which is ascribed to the low amount of GO (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the diffraction peaks of manganese oxide species (JCPDS-24-0734, Mn3O4) can be found in the GM composites and its content increases with the increasement of GO, which is favorable to improve the performance of photocatalysts, because it can act as the hole scavenger for inhibiting the recombination of charge carriers [38]. Similarly, the sulfur (S, JCPDS-08-0247) is also observed in GM composites, which can be ascribed the formation of Mn3O4 by grabbing the S from MnS. And then, the composition and morphology of samples were revealed by TEM as illustrated in Fig. 1(c), (d). The TEM image (Fig. 1(c)) reveals that GO in GM3 possesses single/few-layered-like structure, MnS and Mn3O4 are evenly dispersed on the surface of GO, and the existence of GO and lattice plane for MnS (200), Mn3O4 (101) and S (313) are again confirmed by the HRTEM as seen in Fig. 1(d) and Fig. S1, which is accord with the XRD analysis. And the EDS mapping results indicate that the Mn3O4 is the main species in the edge of the GO nanosheet (Fig. S2). Notably, the introduction of GO brings the refinement of MnS particles as seen in Fig. S3, which may be profitable to increase the photocatalytic active sites. In addition, the presence of GO in GM3 composite is further confirmed by typical peaks at 1311\u202fcm\u22121 and 1587\u202fcm\u22121 ((associated with vibrational stretching at sp3 defect sites (D band) and sp2 sites (G band) [44], respectively) in the Raman spectra (Fig. S4). The surface chemical composition and binding environment of fabricated MnS and GM3 was investigated by the XPS. As illustrated in Fig. S5, the XPS survey of MnS and GM3 demonstrates the exitance of Mn, S, O, and C elements. Fig. 2 depletes the high-resolution XPS spectrum of elements in MnS and GM3. Two peaks at 641.0 (Mn 2p3/2) and 652.6\u202feV (Mn 2p1/2) in the spectra of GM3 are ascribed to Mn2+ in MnS (Fig. 2(a)), while other two peaks at 642.6 (Mn 2p3/2) and 654.4\u202feV (Mn 2p1/2) are assigned to Mn3O4 [45,46]. This result further indicates that the Mn3O4 can be successfully obtained by a simple GO-induced strategy. In addition, the Mn 2p (641.6 (Mn 2p3/2), and 653.2\u202feV (Mn 2p1/2)) binding energy from MnS is significantly shifted as compared with of MnS [10]. The binding energies of S 2p of 160.9 and 162.3\u202feV can be assigned to MnS in GM3, and which are higher than that of S 2p in MnS (160.5 and 161.7\u202feV). And peaks at 163.8\u202feV and 164.9\u202feV are assigned to the S in GM3 composite (Fig. 2(b)). Fig. 2(c) exhibits the O 1s spectrum, the peak intensity of Mn O bond at 530.0\u202feV corresponded to the Mn3O4 in GM3 was remarkably enhanced as compared to MnS (530.1\u202feV) [47]. The C 1\u202fs spectra is showed in Fig. 2(d), the most intense peaks at 284.8\u202feV for MnS and 284.9\u202feV for GM3 are ascribed to the basal carbon and C C/C C bond of GO, respectively. Notably, the peak at 286.2\u202feV can be found, which is attributed to the C O Mn bond. As reported in other literatures [20,31,47,48], the C O M (M stands for metal, like Cu, Ti, Mn, etc.) bond can act as an electron transfer channel for efficient charge carrier separation. Thus the formation of the C O Mn bond is crucial, because it can act as an electron channel for transferring the photogenerated electron from MnS surface to GO [20,47]. These results further confirm that the GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composites are successfully prepared by a simple magnetic stirring method, which is in good agreement with XRD and TEM. More importantly, the presence of strong interactions between MnS, Mn3O4 and GO are also confirmed due to the existence of C O Mn bond and the shift of the XPS peaks. Based on the above analysts, the GO/MnS-Mn3O4 dual cocatalyst system with strong interaction is rational designed by a simple GO-induced strategy. To investigate the photocatalytic activity of all the fabricated samples, the photocatalytic H2S splitting for hydrogen production in a solution containing. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "0.1\u202fM Na2S/0.6\u202fM Na2SO3 under visible light irradiation (\u03bb\u202f>\u202f420\u202fnm) was conducted. First, no H2 signal was detected on GC without light irradiation or photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), alone GO only make trace photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. All the GM composites exhibit higher photocatalytic performance than that of pristine MnS, meaning the addition of GO can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of MnS. Moreover, all the samples are stable within 5\u202fh light irradiation. And among them, GM3 shows the highest photocatalytic performance with H2 evolution rate of 28.4\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fg\u22121\u202fh\u22121, which is 6 folds higher than that over bare MnS. The corresponding AQE of this sample is 0.035% at 400\u202fnm, corresponding H2 evolution amount of 0.26\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh\u22121 (Fig. S6). Photocatalytic performance dropped when further increase the mass ratio of GO to 5\u202fwt%, which may assign to the redundant GO covered the photocatalytic active sites. These results illustrate that the dual cocatalyst strategy can act as a rational method to improve the photocatalytic performance of MnS. The long-time photostability of GM3 in Fig. S7 indicates that this composite possesses a relatively stable performance for 6\u202fh. The activity drops with further increasing the irradiation time, which may be ascribed to the sulfur produced during the reaction progress depositing on the surface of photocatalyst and covering the active site [10,16]. In addition, the XRD, TEM and XPS results confirm that the formation of S in preparation process. Therefore, the function of the S to photocatalytic performance is also exploited over GM3 sample by a simple comparative experiment. To remove the S on the catalyst surface, an annealing process is performed to the GM3 sample in Ar for 5\u202fh at 180\u202f\u00b0C. As a result, the diffraction peaks of S in GM3 are completely disappeared (Fig. 3(c)), meaning the S is completely removed. Though the activity of annealed sample (GM3\u20135\u202fh) is similar to GM3, an inferior stability was obtained in the photocatalytic H2S decomposition experiment, demonstrating the role of S in H2S splitting process is to maintain the stability of the GM composite. Generally, efficient hydrogen evolution from H2S can be affected by the reaction conditions, such as the pH of reaction system, the dosage used and the concentration of the reaction medium, etc. Thus, we explored these factors to determine a more proportional reaction condition for efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production from H2S over GM3 composites, as shown in Fig. 4 . There is a top value at which the amount of photocatalyst in microgram is proportional to the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution rate seen in Fig. 4(a). And the H2 production rate reaches an optimal one when the amount of GM3 is 2.5\u202fmg in Fig. 4(b). For the influence of pH, the concentration of H2S was considered firstly as it can significantly influence the pH value of the reaction system [10]. In Fig. 4(c), the pH value of the reaction medium drops with increasing the concentration of H2S and keeps stale in a narrow range of 7.5\u20138.0 once the concentration of H2S is higher than 2\u202fM. The H2 evolution rate display a linear increasing trend until the H2S concentration up to 3\u202fM. The H2 production rate dropped with further increasing the H2S concentration. In order to exclude the influence of H2S on the reaction pH, we have designed another experiment by tuning the reaction pH to 7.5\u20138.0 with HCl, H2SO4 and KHC8H4O4 without bubbling H2S to the reaction system. But no H2 signal was detected on GC (Fig. S8). This result demonstrates that H2S is indispensable for photocatalytic hydrogen production. As for the influence of the sacrificial donor concentration on the H2 evolution rate of GM3 composite, we tuned the concentration ratio of Na2S and Na2SO3. The result demonstrates that the proportional concentration ratio of Na2S to Na2SO3 is 0.1\u202fM\u20130.6\u202fM (Fig. 4(d)). Generally, the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor is determined by three factors: i) sunlight response ability, ii) effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, iii) photocatalytic reaction on material surface [38,49,50]. First, the influence of the incorporation of GO in the MnS on the sunlight response ability is evaluated by the UV\u2013vis DRS. As illustrated in Fig. 5 and Table S1, all the samples exhibit enhanced visible-light absorption as compared to MnS. Among them, GM3 possess best sunlight response ability, which is favorable to the excellent photocatalytic H2S splitting performance. In addition, some additional absorption peaks can be found in visible-light range, which are ascribed to the internal transitions in the partly occupied 3d states of Mn and the bulk defects in crystals [10]. Notably, the new strong absorption peak can be observed in GM composites around 233\u202fnm corresponding to the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition of conjugated structure of graphene [28,34], indicating that GO is successfully coating with MnS. In addition, the blue shifting of absorption band (peak) of composites around 400\u202fnm as compared with MnS is attribute to the presence of GO resulting strong chemical bonding with MnS, which is favorable for enhancing the photocatalytic ability of GM composites. This analogous phenomenon was also reported in these literatures [34,51,52]. Meanwhile, comparing with pristine MnS, the red shift of absorption edge of GM composites further proving the formation of C-O-Mn bond, resulting in reduced band gap of MnS [31,53]. In addition to the optical absorption edge, the band positions are also important for photocatalytic reactions [3]. The higher conduction band (CB) position (i.e. more negative) is more beneficial to a photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction, relatively. Therefore, the energy band position is calculated by combining the UV\u2013vis DRS and XPS valence band spectrum. First, the valence band (VB) of MnS and GM3 were investigated by XPS valence band spectrum (see Fig. S9 and S10) and determined to be +1.23\u202feV and\u202f+\u202f0.82\u202feV, respectively. By combining the UV\u2013vis DRS of samples, the final conduction band of MnS and GM3 was calculated to be \u22121.33\u202feV and\u202f\u2212\u202f1.51\u202feV, respectively. The GM3 exhibits a more negative potential, which is favorable to the enhanced photocatalytic performance. The transport behaviors of photoinduced charge carriers of GMx samples were also studied by the Nyquist plots of EIS. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "in light field. The samples with GO exhibit a decreased arc radius of the Nyquist plot in Fig. 6(a), suggesting a smaller charge transfer resistance, thus, a faster interfacial charge transfer rate occurred in the GMx (x\u202f=\u202f1, 3, 5) samples with the introduction of GO. This result is in line with the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 3(a)and 3(b)). In addition, the PL experiment was employed to estimate the photoexcitation behaviors of samples under an excitation at 380\u202fnm (Fig. 6(b)). The emission intensity of GM composites is weakened with the introduction of GO, indicating that the presence of GO is favorable for suppressing the recombination process of photoinduced electron-holes [54]. Among them, the GM3 shows a lowest the PL intensity, which agrees well with the photocatalytic activity evaluation. The improved charge separation efficiency may be attributed to two aspects. Firstly, the synergistic effect of GO-induced-forming cocatalyst Mn3O4 and the reduced GO, because Mn3O4 can act as a hole scavenger and the reduced GO can serve as an electron conductor for efficient charge carrier separation [38\u201340]. Secondly, the formation of electron transfer channel i.e. C O Mn bond between MnS and GO can inhibit the carrier recombination. In summary, the addition of GO into MnS has a significant influence on the light absorption, band structure and charge separation process of MnS, which is crucial to enhance the photocatalytic performance. On the basis of above results, the photocatalytic mechanism for H2 production from H2S over GM3 under visible light irradiation could be descripted in Scheme 1 . The major reaction steps in this mechanism are described as following equations [3,10]. H2S+OH\u2013\u2194HS\u2212+H2O Photocatalyst+h\u03bd\u2192h+VB+e\u2212CB HS\u2212+2h+VB\u2192H++S0 2H++2e\u2212CB\u2192H2\u2191 S0+SO32\u2212\u2192S2O32\u2212 S2\u2212+2h+VB+SO32\u2212\u2192S2O32\u2212 Firstly, the S2\u2212 and SO3 2\u2212 as electron donors, play a role of providing a strong basic environment for improving the absorption ability of H2S gas to generate more HS\u2212 maintain a stable pH value at 7.5\u20138.0. Under the irradiation of visible light, photogenerated holes from valence band (VB) of MnS in GM3 composites can be trapped by Mn3O4 and then to react with HS\u2212 and SO3 2\u2212 to form H+, S0 and S2O3 2\u2212. While the photoinduced electron of MnS in the GM3 composites transfer through the C O Mn bond to the reduced GO to reduce protons (H+) to obtain molecular H2. All in all, the photogenerated electrons and holes can be stimulatingly transferred from catalysts to the reduced GO and Mn3O4 cocatalysts, respectively. And ultimately, an improved photocatalytic H2S splitting performance of GO/MnS-Mn3O4 is obtained.  In this work, we successfully fabricate a novel GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composite for enhancing the photocatalytic H2S splitting performance by a simple approach. The XRD, TEM and XPS results demonstrate that the GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composites were successfully constructed with strong interaction between GO, MnS, and Mn3O4, because the C O Mn bond can be found in GM composites. As a result, the bidirectional charge carrier separation by Mn3O4 and reduced GO can trigger significantly improved separation of electrons and holes. In addition, the sunlight response ability can be further improved by the introduction of GO. Therefore, the GO/MnS-Mn3O4 exhibit enhanced H2 evolution performance, which is approximately 6 times than that of bare MnS. Finally, the dual cocatalysts promotion mechanism over GO/MnS-Mn3O4 composites is also studied. These results indicate GO-induced dual cocatalyst formation is an efficient strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apsusc.2019.05.353.txt", "paper": ["Since the first report by Honda and Fujishima [1], titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been a popular photocatalyst because of its broad functionality, long-term durability, and non-toxicity. Because TiO2 is a semiconductor with a wide bandgap (anatase TiO2 has a bandgap of 3.2\u202feV and rutile TiO2 has a bandgap of 3.0\u202feV, allowing absorption of light with wavelengths shorter than 388 and 413\u202fnm, respectively), TiO2 can act as a photocatalyst when irradiated with UV light. However, only a few percent of the total energy of natural solar light is in the UV region. Although various types of photocatalysts such as tungsten oxide [2], oxynitride [3], and vanadate [4] have been developed to utilize the portion of solar light with longer wavelength, modification of TiO2 to increase its photoresponse has also been extensively conducted. For example, Asashi et al. [5] narrowed the bandgap of TiO2 by anion doping. Tatsuma et al. reported the plasmonic effect of gold nanoparticles supported on TiO2, which endowed TiO2 with a visible light response [6]. As an alternative approach to develop TiO2 with a visible light response, preparation of colored TiO2 has attracted much attention [7\u201311]. Colored TiO2 can be obtained by annealing TiO2 under a reducing atmosphere; such materials have been used as a gloss for ceramics. The coloring is considered to originate from the formation of defects such as vacancies or disorder in the TiO2 lattice by calcination under a reducing atmosphere; as a result, such coloring of TiO2 is called \u201cself-doping\u201d. In the present study, we introduce defects into TiO2 by exposure to plasma generated in aqueous solution. There have been many reports of plasma generation on or in water [12]. In the present case, a short pulsed high voltage with high repetition frequency is applied to tungsten wire electrodes placed in a sample solution to generate discharge plasma in the solution, which we call \u201csolution plasma\u201d [13]. Solution plasma is attracting much attention for localized high-energy reactions in aqueous systems. We previously reported that volatile solutes such as ammonia or lower alcohols decomposed to vigorously evolve hydrogen (H2) gas when plasma was generated in water containing the volatile solutes [14]. Effective decomposition of solutes and vigorous evolution of H2 are expected to facilitate TiO2 reduction and coloration. Here, we investigate the acceleration of TiO2 coloration induced by the generation of plasma in aqueous ammonia solution containing dispersed TiO2.  TiO2 powder (P-25) containing both anatase and rutile TiO2 was obtained from Nippon Aerosil (Japan). Ammonia aqueous solution, glycerol (GL), and terephthalic acid (TA) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Japan). All materials were used without further purification. Ultrapure water was used in all experiments. Plasma was generated in an ammonia aqueous solution (ca. 5%) containing TiO2 powder (0.50\u202fg) by a custom-made bipolar high-voltage pulsed power supply (Kurita Manufacturing, Japan). The volume of the solution was 50\u202fcm3 and its conductivity was 100\u2013150\u202fmS\u202fm\u22121. The typical discharge conditions monitored by an oscilloscope were as follows: the applied peak voltage was ca. \u00b11.5\u202fkV, the repetition frequency was 50\u202fkHz, and the power consumption was ca. 380\u202fW. Tungsten electrodes with a diameter of 1.0\u202fmm were used for plasma generation. To avoid the rise of the solution temperature during the discharge process, cooling water (10\u202f\u00b0C) was circulated through a water jacket placed around the Pyrex glass reaction vessel [14]. After plasma treatment, the TiO2 powder was filtered, rinsed, and then dried before characterization. A schematic diagram of the reaction setup is shown in Fig. 1 . Optical emission spectra (OES) of the plasma were acquired using a multichannel UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (USB2000\u202f+\u202fUV-VIS-ES, Ocean Optics, USA) through the wall of the Pyrex glass reaction vessel. The OES measurements were conducted in the absence of TiO2 because the turbidity by TiO2 hindered the OES measurements. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the TiO2 powder samples were collected by a UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer (V-550, JASCO, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere (ISV469, JASCO, Japan). Spectralon\u00ae (Labshere, USA) was used as a white standard. The specific surface areas of the samples were measured by the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) technique using an automatic chemisorption analyzer (Autochem II 2920, Micromeritics, USA). Samples were pretreated at 393\u202fK for 30\u202fmin in a helium gas flow prior to the BET measurements. The crystallographic structure of the TiO2 powder samples was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical X'Pert diffractometer (the Netherlands) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (0.15406\u202fnm). After each powder sample was mixed with ethanol, the resulting paste was placed on the glass sample holder for the measurements. Raman spectra of the TiO2 samples were obtained by a laser Raman spectrophotometer (NRS-3300, JASCO, Japan). The wavelength of the laser used to measure Raman spectra was 532\u202fnm. Raman spectra were normalized by the peak intensity at around 144\u202fcm\u22121. To obtain information about the electronic and crystal structures of the samples, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements were carried out. Untreated and plasma-treated TiO2 samples were dispersed in ethanol. The sample solutions were placed on holey carbon films on TEM grids. A scanning transmission electron microscope (JEM-ARM200F, JEOL, Japan) equipped with a probe corrector was used at an acceleration voltage of 80\u202fkV. The EELS measurements were performed using a spectrometer (Enfinium, Gatan, USA) attached to the electron microscope. The energy dispersion was set to 0.05\u202feV\u202fch\u22121 for the Ti-L edge and the energy spread of the electron beam was 0.45\u202feV. We acquired O-K edges at an energy dispersion of 0.25\u202feV\u202fch\u22121 and the energy spread of the electron beam was 1.0\u202feV. To calibrate the energy scale of each spectrum, a zero-loss peak was measured simultaneously in dual EELS mode. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded at room temperature using an ESR spectrometer (JES-TE200 JEOL). A GL aqueous solution (10\u202fmmol\u202fdm\u22123, 15\u202fcm3) containing platinum nanoparticles supported on TiO2 (15\u202fmg) was placed in a cylindrical reaction vessel (volume: 100\u202fcm3). The author recently reported that GL is an effective sacrificial reagent in photocatalytic H2 evolution [15]. To facilitate photocatalytic reduction, platinum nanoparticles were supported as cocatalysts on TiO2 by a sonochemical method [16]. The photocatalyst particles. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "were dispersed by placing the vessel in an ultrasonic cleaning bath for 5\u202fmin and then the suspension was purged with argon (Ar) for 10\u202fmin. The completion of Ar purging was checked by measuring the remaining air in the headspace of the reaction vessel using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD; GC-8A, Shimadzu, Japan). A xenon lamp (MAX-302, Asahi Spectra, Japan) was used as a UV light source. The reaction solution was irradiated with light between 250 and 385\u202fnm (Fig. 2 ). During irradiation, the reaction vessel was placed in a temperature-controlled water bath (25\u202f\u00b0C) and the reaction solution was subjected to magnetic stirring. The UV light intensity at the bottom of the vessel was 5\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122. The pH of the solution was not adjusted. H2 in the gas phase of the reaction vessel was analyzed by the GC-TCD. The formation of hydroxyl radicals ( OH) was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. A TA aqueous solution (4\u202fcm3, 2\u202fmmol\u202fdm\u22123) containing dispersed TiO2 photocatalyst (10\u202fmg) in a disposable optical cell was illuminated by a commercially available black lamp or fluorescent lamp at intensities of 0.6 and 0.4\u202fmW\u202fcm\u22122, respectively, for 10\u202fmin. In the case of the fluorescent lamp, an acrylic resin plate was used as a UV-cutoff filter because it was transparent to light with a wavelength longer than ca. 400\u202fnm. The spectra of the light sources are shown in Fig. 2. In this method, photocatalytically generated OH stoichiometrically reacted with TA to form fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA). Measuring the fluorescence intensity of HTA provided the yield of OH radicals. The fluorescent spectrum measured using excitation light with a wavelength of 315\u202fnm coincided with the reported HTA spectrum. The fluorescence intensity at 425\u202fnm corresponds to the amount of HTA [17,18]. Commercially available HTA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as a standard.  Fig. 3 shows the OES of the plasma generated in an aqueous ammonia solution [14]. The OES contains UV emission, which can excite TiO2. The Balmer series of H, O, and OH were observed as the main peaks. In addition, characteristic NH and N2 signals were also observed [19,20]. During plasma generation, H2 and N2 were vigorously evolved with a molar ratio of ca. ca. 3.0:1.0, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of ammonia. When ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was added instead of ammonia, the OES did not contain nitrogen-related lines; only H, O, and OH signals originating from water molecule decomposition were observed. The amount of gas evolved from the NH4Cl solution was smaller than that from the aqueous ammonia solution (several milliliters vs. 1300\u202fmL over 10\u202fmin). These results can be explained by the generation mechanism of plasma in water. Because the plasma is generated in the water vapor bubbles between the electrodes, the OES contain the spectral lines originating from decomposition of water molecules and volatile solutes such as ammonia, but not lines from atmospheric nitrogen or non-volatile solutes such as NH4Cl. Details of the plasma decomposition of aqueous ammonia solution have been reported elsewhere [14]. The color of TiO2 changed from pristine white to blue during plasma treatment. Diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2 before and after plasma treatment are shown in Fig. 4a. After plasma treatment in aqueous ammonia solution, TiO2 displayed a broad absorption band that spanned the visible and near-infrared regions. After TiO2 was treated in aqueous NH4Cl solution, it also displayed a broad absorption band, but the absorbance of this band was lower than that of the sample treated in aqueous ammonia solution, implying that the TiO2 coloration is related to ammonia decomposition. Fig. 4b illustrates the dependence of the diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2 plasma treated in aqueous ammonia solution on plasma treatment time. The coloration increased with the duration of plasma treatment. The absorbance increased non-linearly with plasma treatment time because of the consumption of ammonia during the reaction and the accompanying decrease in the amount of reactants generated in situ. The XRD patterns of the untreated TiO2 and that subjected to plasma treatment for 180\u202fmin in aqueous ammonia solution are shown in Fig. 5 . Table 1 lists the fractions of the constituent rutile and anatase phases, which were obtained using the empirical equation proposed by Spurr et al. [21]. Some diffraction peaks that were not assignable to either anatase or rutile TiO2 were considered to originate from non-stoichiometric titanium oxide. The fraction of rutile to anatase phases is a barometer indicating the extent of the phase transition of TiO2. No marked changes in crystallographic properties were observed (Table 1), suggesting that the phase transition from anatase to rutile was not promoted by the present plasma treatment. The specific surface areas of the TiO2 samples are also listed in Table 1. Plasma treatment did not cause a substantial decrease in the specific surface area of TiO2, indicating that the sintering or growth of TiO2 particles was not induced by the plasma treatment. To compare conventional heat treatment with the present plasma treatment, TiO2 was calcined at 650\u202f\u00b0C in 10% H2 in Ar gas flow. The characteristics of the calcined TiO2 sample are also included in Table 1. For the calcined TiO2, the rutile fraction increased considerably during calcination. In addition, the diffraction peaks were narrower than those of the untreated and plasma-treated TiO2 samples, indicating that the crystallites grew during calcination. The calcined TiO2 was slightly grayish in color, which was quite different from the blue plasma-treated TiO2. The BET surface area of the calcined TiO2 also decreased compared with that of the untreated TiO2, consistent with the growth of the crystallites during calcination. These findings emphasize the uniqueness of the present plasma treatment process. Fig. 6a presents the Raman spectra of TiO2 treated with plasma for different durations. The peaks located at around 144, 399, 519, and 639\u202fcm\u22121 were assigned to the Eg, B1g, B1g\u202f+\u202fA1g, and Eg modes of anatase TiO2, respectively [22]. A magnified view of the peaks around 144\u202fcm\u22121 is shown in Fig. 6b. No peaks originating from rutile TiO2 were observed for the untreated TiO2 (spectrum labeled \u201c0\u202fmin\u201d. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "in Fig. 6a). This is because the rutile content of P-25 was low (below 16.4%, as shown in Table 1) and the relative intensities of the peaks originating from rutile TiO2 are low compared with those from anatase TiO2. After plasma treatment, peaks assignable to rutile TiO2 were still not observed, indicating that the phase transition from anatase to rutile hardly occurred during the plasma treatment, which agrees with the XRD results. It is worth noting the shift of the 144-cm\u22121 peak to higher wavenumber with increasing plasma treatment duration (Fig. 6b). It has been reported that this peak shift originates from the formation of oxygen defects in the anatase TiO2 lattice [23,24]. The peak shift became larger as the duration of plasma treatment increased, suggesting that more oxygen defects formed. STEM images and EELS measurements of the untreated and plasma-treated TiO2 samples are displayed in Fig. 7 . Annular dark field (ADF) images of the untreated and plasma-treated TiO2 samples are depicted in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. Both powders have a particle diameter of tens of nanometers. The O-K edge spectra of the two specimens were acquired from the square areas indicated in Fig. 7a and b. These spectra show similar features with a split peak at around 530\u202feV, as shown in Fig. 7c. However, the splitting structures are different; i.e., the plasma-treated TiO2 has a splitting of 2.0\u202feV, whereas the untreated specimen has a splitting of 2.5\u202feV. Splitting structures in O-K edge spectra of titanium oxides arise from t2g\u2013eg splitting of Ti 3d orbitals, and the resulting peak separation of 2.5\u202feV is consistent with that of titanium dioxides (Ti4+) [25]. Because reduced titanium oxides exhibit smaller splitting than those before reduction [25], the untreated TiO2 was considered to be reduced during plasma treatment. Fig. 7d shows Ti-L edge spectra for the untreated and plasma-treated TiO2. The samples displayed common spectral features, e.g., the first peak at around 459\u202feV was sharp and the second peak had a shoulder on the high-energy-loss side (indicated by an arrow). These spectral features suggest that both specimens mostly consist of titanium dioxides containing Ti4+ with the anatase crystal structure [25]. However, a chemical shift of the Ti-L edge was observed (Fig. 7d): the Ti-L edge spectrum of the plasma-treated TiO2 shifted to lower energy loss by 0.6\u202feV compared with that of the untreated sample. This chemical shift indicates that the plasma-treated TiO2 was slightly reduced compared with the untreated TiO2. The EELS results described above suggest that the untreated TiO2 was partially reduced during plasma treatment but maintained the averaged crystal structure of the anatase phase. ESR spectra were measured to investigate the defects in the plasma-treated TiO2. Fig. 8 shows the ESR spectra of TiO2 before and after plasma treatment for 180\u202fmin. In the case of the plasma-treated sample, a definite peak was observed at around 328\u202fmT. This result clearly shows the colored TiO2 contained unpaired electrons, which might be attributed to Ti3+ species and oxygen vacancies. The above characterization results indicate that the plasma-treated TiO2 was reduced via generation of oxygen vacancies while maintaining the nanoscale morphology of the P25 starting material. The color of the present plasma-treated TiO2 was retained for several months in the ambient atmosphere, suggesting that oxygen defects are located not only on the surface of the material, but also in the bulk [26]. Generally, H2 reduction at high temperature is needed to synthesize stably colored TiO2. Tsuyumoto et al. [27] reported that a temperature above 900\u202f\u00b0C was needed to obtain blue non-stoichiometric TiOx from anatase TiO2 powder that displayed oxidation resistance in air. Such high-temperature treatment generally induces phase transition from anatase to rutile TiO2 [28], which was not observed in the present case. The oxidation resistance of the present blue TiO2 can be explained by UV excitation of TiO2. Because the OES of the plasma contained UV light (Fig. 3), TiO2 was excited during the plasma treatment process. Wang and co-workers reported that photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs may facilitate the self-doping process of TiO2 [8]. They considered that Ti3+ can be produced deep inside TiO2 because electron\u2013hole pairs can be excited not only at the surface of TiO2 but also inside the bulk TiO2. In other words, it is difficult to obtain colored anatase TiO2 by the conventional calcination of TiO2 in an H2 atmosphere. Pitchaimuthu et al. [29] reported that pristine white anatase TiO2 turned light brown and the anatase phase partially converted to the brookite phase when solution plasma was generated in an aqueous dispersion of anatase TiO2 particles. The resulting heterojunction formed between the anatase and brookite phases enhanced the activity of the plasma-treated TiO2. They mentioned that H radicals generated by the plasma decomposition of water molecules reduced TiO2, leading to coloration. Although a similar reaction scheme is proposed here, no phase transition occurred in the present study. This difference is considered to originate from the temperature during plasma treatment. In the present case, a large amount of energy is considered to be consumed in the decomposition of ammonia molecules rather than in the TiO2 phase transition. Thus, numerous reductants are generated and the temperature remains too low to induce phase transition of TiO2. We next examined the photocatalytic activity of the blue TiO2 in H2 evolution from aqueous GL solution. The amount of H2 evolved by the plasma-treated TiO2 (105\u202f\u03bcmol of H2 generated in 2\u202fh) was smaller than that generated by the untreated TiO2 (186\u202f\u03bcmol of H2 in 2\u202fh). That is, the photocatalytic activity of the plasma-treated TiO2 was inferior to that of the untreated TiO2. The coloration of TiO2 was caused by the formation of energy levels originating from oxygen defects, which were located 0.75\u20131.18\u202feV below the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2 [30]. The lower activity of the plasma-treated TiO2 than that of the untreated TiO2 in H2 evolution from aqueous GL solution suggests that the energy bands originating from oxygen defects trapped the photoexcited electrons and suppressed proton reduction. The results of OH radical determination by. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "fluorescence spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 9 . The results for untreated and plasma-treated pure anatase and rutile TiO2 are also shown. OH radicals formed via the reaction of holes with hydroxide ions and their formation is considered to be an indicator of oxidation activity. Under UV irradiation, untreated TiO2 provided more OH radicals that the plasma-treated TiO2, regardless of the phase composition. In contrast, the plasma-treated TiO2 provided more OH radicals than the untreated samples under visible light irradiation except for the case of rutile TiO2. It has been reported that the defects in TiO2 lattices act as recombination sites for photoexcited electron\u2013hole pairs [31\u201333], which lowers the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Conversely, oxygen defects are also believed to contribute to the visible light absorption through the concept of self-doping [7\u201311]. In the present case, factors other than defects, e.g., phase composition, or growth of TiO2 particles can be excluded because they were not observed after plasma treatment. The results displayed in Fig. 9 suggest that oxygen defects can help to enhance photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. However, such enhancement was only observed in the case of anatase TiO2. It is important to clarify the correlation between phase structure and the contribution of oxygen defects to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in future work.  The present wet process using plasma in an aqueous ammonia solution introduced oxygen defects into TiO2 powder under ambient conditions. Raman, ESR, and EELS results indicated the formation of oxygen defects and the reduction of Ti4+ occurred during plasma treatment. The blue color originating from oxygen defects in the plasma-treated TiO2 was maintained in air for several months. In this method, reductants formed in situ by the plasma-induced decomposition of ammonia molecules was considered to reduce TiO2. No phase transition from anatase to rutile TiO2 was observed, indicating that the TiO2 was not exposed to high temperature during plasma treatment. The plasma-treated anatase TiO2 exhibited superior photocatalytic oxidation activity to that of an untreated anatase sample under visible light irradiation. Changes in the other properties of TiO2, such as optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, are also expected upon introducing oxygen defects. Therefore, the developed process will facilitate new applications of colored oxide materials, including as cathodes of lithium-ion batteries [34] and photoelectrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells [35].  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

For instance, patterned silicon substrate (PSiS) with random or periodical micro/nano structures has been fabricated and extensively used in solar cells to achieve higher cell efficiency [5]. The size and morphology of the patterns significantly affect the reflectivity of the silicon substrate surface and the cell efficiency of solar cell [6,7]. For achieving enhanced performance of Si-based optoelectronic device, the sophisticated 3D microstructures of Si are sometimes desired. Intensive studies have focused on the wet etching behavior of Si microstructures etched in alkaline etchants. The anisotropic etching effects of KOH and TMAH etchants with varying etching concentration and temperature on wet etching behavior of Si have been studied [8\u201312]. It has been reported that KOH etchant favors higher etching rate of (100) Si substrate and lower etching rate of exposed (111) plane than TMAH etchant within the concentration range of 5\u201325\u202fwt% and temperature range of 60\u201380\u202f\u00b0C; however, the relatively lower etching rate of undercut (111) plane in KOH etchant results in rather rough surface [13]. Moreover, KOH etchant introduces undesirable K+ ion contamination in etched Si microstructures, thus resulting in the degraded performance of integrated circuit devices [14]. In contrast, TMAH etchant avoids the introduction of annoying K+ ion contamination, and exhibits lower etching rates for (100) plane of Si substrate, as well as facilitates higher etching rate and smoother surface for undercut (111) plane than KOH etchant with same concentration and temperature [11,13]. The etching rate of crystallographic planes exhibits strong dependence on the concentration and temperature of etchant. Etching-rate peaks appear in the 25\u202fwt% KOH and 20\u202fwt% TMAH water solutions for (100), (110), (221), (320), and (111) Si planes [11], in addition, higher etching temperature for both KOH and TMAH water solutions favors larger etching rate of (100) and (111) planes [13]. Because wet etching enables sophisticated crystallographic specific etching of Si substrate, efforts have been devoted to study the crystallographic evolution behavior. Various crystallographic planes like (100), (110), (111), (210), (211), (221), (311), and (320) planes etched in TMAH solutions have been reported [12,15\u201318]. For instance, using millimeter-sized hemispherical single-crystal silicon model and 3D profile measurement, Kazuo et al. revealed the Miller index and etching rate of various exposed crystallographic planes etched in 10\u201325\u202fwt% TMAH water solutions [12]. Moreover, various crystallographic planes showing constant slant angles appeared on the sophisticated Si microstructure models such as octahedral frustums, pyramidal frustums, and pyramids [19\u201321]. The crystallographic evolution behavior of micron-sized truncated pyramid with convex corner on (100) Si substrate in 25\u202fwt% TMAH water solution has been revealed [18]. Nevertheless, previous studies mainly focused on the Si etching in TMAH solutions with high TMAH concentration ranging from 10\u202fwt% to 25\u202fwt% [12,22\u201324]. To our best knowledge, the crystallographic evolution of high Miller index planes on Si microstructure in the etchants with low TMAH concentration has not been clearly revealed. Therefore, much room is left for systematic studies regarding the time and concentration-dependent wet etching behavior of Si microstructures in etchants with varying TMAH concentration for revealing crystallographic and morphological evolution behavior, as well as wet etching mechanism. In this work, the crystallographic and morphological evolutions of (100) Si substrate with circular aperture SiO2 mask etched in varying TMAH concentration (1\u201325\u202fwt%) were systematically investigated using SEM and AFM. A series of exposed high and low Miller index crystallographic planes were indexed. The etching rates of exposed crystallographic planes were accurately determined. The relationship between the etching rates of crystallographic planes and morphological evolution behavior was established.  The circular aperture SiO2 mask was prepared following the standard photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) processes on a 2-in. P-type (100) Si wafer (thickness: 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202f\u03bcm, resistivity: 1\u201310\u202f\u03a9\u00b7cm) with known [01\u00af1\u00af] and [011\u00af] crystallographic orientations. The SiO2 film (thickness: 400\u202fnm) was firstly deposited on flat Si substrates using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, then circular aperture photoresist arrays were fabricated on the SiO2 film by photolithography process. The diameter and pitch of photoresist arrays were 5.0\u202f\u03bcm and 13.1\u202f\u03bcm. Subsequently, Si substrate with photoresist arrays was subjected to RIE (CF4 and O2) to produce SiO2 patterns with identical periodicity of the photoresist arrays. Finally, the photoresist arrays were removed with acetone solution. The morphology and dimension of Si substrate with circular aperture SiO2 mask were characterized with SEM and AFM (Fig. 1 ). The depth and pitch of SiO2 circular aperture arrays are 400\u202fnm and 13.1\u202f\u03bcm, respectively. SEM results revealed that the sidewall of circular aperture is slightly slanted, and the diameter of circular aperture decreases from the top (5.9\u202f\u03bcm) to the bottom (5.4\u202f\u03bcm). Note that the circular aperture mask offers the equal chance of exposing various crystallographic planes of Si substrate, and the circular aperture arrays with uniform dimensions facilitate clear comparison of the dimensional evolution of etched Si microstructures. Prior to the wet etching, the (100) Si substrates with circular aperture SiO2 mask were critically cleaned by an optimized RCA standard cleaning method [25,26]. Then, (100) Si substrates were treated with buffered oxide etching solution\u2014HF (49\u202fwt%) and NH4F (40\u202fwt%) mixture (HF: NH4F\u202f=\u202f1:6 at volume ratio) for 10\u202fs to remove the native oxide layer. The (100) Si substrate with circular aperture SiO2 mask was etched in the TMAH water solutions (Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., LTD) with varying concentration (1\u201325\u202fwt%) at 70\u202f\u00b0C up to 20\u202fmin. The TMAH etchant was continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer with the rotation speed of 900\u202frpm. After etching, the SiO2 mask on Si substrate was removed by the BOE solution. Note that the rather fast rotation speed of magnetic stirrer was employed for an enhanced mass and heat transfer in the solution to ensure homogeneous temperature and concentration of etchant. Owing to the inability of glassware to withstand the concentrated TMAH and BOE solutions at elevated temperature, the beaker, carrier basket, coverplates, and thermocouple protection tube used for wet etching experiments were thus all. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "fabricated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) material. The etching process was quasi-continuously operated. As shown in Fig. 2 , the PTFE basket loaded with up to 12 samples was placed inside the beaker containing 200\u202fmL TMAH solution as soon as the mixture temperature reached 70\u202f\u00b0C and remained stable. Note that the Si samples with the size of 10\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4\u202fmm for wet etching experiment were cut from 2-in. wafers. When a specific time was reached, the small coverplate was uncovered, the basket loaded with samples was quickly removed from the etchant. A piece of sample was unloaded from the groove of basket by a pair of PTFE tweezers and dropped into ultrapure water (18.2\u202fM\u03a9\u00b7cm) in a clean PTFE plasticware. Then the basket was immediately placed back inside the beaker, and the small coverplate was placed back to recover the rectangular opening in the large coverplate (within 3\u202fs). The steps above were repeated for other samples. Moreover, the carrier basket was kept hanging to allow the normal operation of magnetic stirring functioning during the etching process. The etching experiments were repeated more than twice to check the reproducibility of the results. The morphology and dimension of Si substrate covered with SiO2 mask and etched patterned Si substrate (PSiS, which will be used subsequently) without SiO2 mask samples were characterized with a field emission SEM (FESEM, Zeiss Supra 55). The acceleration voltage was set to 10\u202fkV, and SEM images were recorded with standard E-T secondary electron detector. For PSiS samples, the acceleration voltage was set to 15\u202fkV, and SEM images were recorded with a secondary electron in-lens detector. The morphology and 3D dimension were obtained with a commercial AFM system (Bruker MultiMode 8) under ambient conditions (25\u202f\u00b0C, 35\u201340% RH). All samples were characterized in ScanAsyst mode using the special Opus 4XC-NN probe featuring a sharp tip (tip radius: <7\u202fnm, force constant of cantilever: 2.5\u202fN/m) and vertical front side edge for achieving artifact-free AFM characterizations [21,27]. All AFM image analyses were performed with NanoScope Analysis software. Note that for the AFM depth and slant angle analyses of the apertures, the baseline height was leveled against the (100) Si substrate. The cross-section SEM image was used to determine the dimension of crystallographic plane that cannot be directly characterized by AFM. The process used to prepare samples for cross-section SEM image characterizations are as follows: the etched PSiS was vertically embedded in epoxy resin, then ground with abrasive papers along specific crystallographic orientation. Finally, the epoxy resin was removed with acetone and the cross-section SEM images were recorded.  The time dependence morphological and crystallographic evolution behaviors of PSiS etched in 1\u202fwt% TMAH were first studied. At 1\u202fmin, rounded aperture arrays with the steep sidewall and bottom (100) plane appeared (Fig. 3a), which can be attributed to the SiO2 mask effect, the anisotropic crystallographic etching of Si substrate, and etching rate difference of various crystallographic planes. Four types of crystallographic planes with 4-fold symmetry, i.e., C1-, C2-, C3, and C4-planes, appeared on the sidewall of rounded apertures (Fig. 3b). AFM line profile analyses revealed that the slant angles of C1-, C2-, C3-, and C4-planes are 53.2\u00b0, 45.0\u00b0, 54.6\u00b0, and 35.1\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 3c\u2013e). Moreover, dense bulges composed of merged quadrilateral hillocks were found on the bottom (100) plane of inside rounded apertures. Similar hillocks on the etched (100) plane have been found by P.M. Sarro et al. [28]. After being etched for 2\u202fmin, the rounded apertures changed into inverted octahedral frustums (Fig. 3f), and the depth increased from 520\u202fnm to 1020\u202fnm (Fig. 3h\u2013j). The considerable increase of the depth caused the extension of the sidewall of inverted octahedral frustums. The exposed area of etched bottom (100) plane and the bulge density on (100) plane reduced significantly (Fig. 3g). The C1\u2010 and C2-planes shrank laterally; by contrast, the C3- and C4-planes were enlarged along the top/bottom edges of inverted octahedral frustums. AFM line profile analyses revealed that the C2\u2010 and C3-planes extended downward (Fig. 3h\u2013j). It should be noted that the slant angles of C1-, C2-, C3-, and C4-planes kept constant. For the case of 3\u202fmin, the length of top edge, the depth, and sidewall area of inverted octahedral frustums increased (Fig. 3k), which can be attributed to the continued etching of bottom (100) plane and the sidewall crystallographic planes on the sidewall. The shrink of the bottom plane of inverted octahedral frustums is caused by the difference in the etching rate between various slant crystallographic planes and bottom flat (100) plane. In addition, the etched bottom (100) plane became smoother with etching time. AFM line profile analyses revealed the decreased exposed area of C1-plane, and disappearance of C4-plane as the enlarged C2\u2010 and C3-planes (Fig. 3l\u2013o). At 5\u202fmin, the size of inverted octahedral frustums markedly increased with larger exposed area of sidewall and depth; in contrast, the area of bottom (100) plane further decreased (Fig. 4a). The C1\u2010 and C2-planes laterally shrank due to the extension of the C3-plane (Fig. 4b). It can be found that the shape of C3-plane changed from a trapezoid into a triangle, thus leading to the bottom connection of adjacent C2-plane (Fig. 4b\u2013d). When the etching time was increased to be 7\u202fmin, the inverted octahedral frustums were etched into inverted octahedral pyramids as the bottom (100) plane completely disappeared (Fig. 4e and f). The C1- and C2-planes continuously shrank in the lateral direction. The depth increased from 2.50\u202f\u03bcm to 3.44\u202f\u03bcm. For the case of 8\u202fmin, the inverted octahedral pyramids evolved into the inverted pyramids composed of C3-planes (Fig. 4i and j). The C1- and C2-planes were etched away, and the slant angle (54.6\u00b0) of C3-plane is invariable during the evolution process (Fig. 4k and l). The depth (3.44\u202f\u03bcm) of inverted pyramid remained stable owing to the disappearance of etched bottom (100) plane and rather slow etching rate of C3-plane. As reported, the appearance of pyramid is caused by the higher etching rate of (100) substrate plane and inversely lower rate of etched side planes\u2014(111) planes [29]. At longer etching time, the pattern morphology remained. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "to be the inverted pyramid, whereas the top edge length and depth slowly increased due to the continuous undercut etching of C3-plane under SiO2 mask [30], thus contributing to an inverted pyramids with lager size. Then, the morphological and crystallographic evolutions of PSiS etched in higher TMAH concentration (5\u201325\u202fwt%) were systematically investigated. For the case of 5\u202fwt% TMAH solution, inverted octahedral frustums instead of the rounded apertures firstly appeared in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution at 1\u202fmin (Fig. 5a). Note that only C1-, C2-, and C3-planes appeared on the sidewall of inverted octahedral frustums (see the inserts in Fig. 5a). AFM line profile analyses confirmed the absence of C4-plane. For the period of 2\u20133\u202fmin, the sidewall area and the depth of inverted octahedral frustums significantly increased (Fig. 5b\u2013d). In contrast, the exposed area of etched bottom (100) plane was found to be constantly reducing. Moreover, the C1\u2010 and C2-planes laterally shrank, and conversely the C3-plane enlarged. At 7\u202fmin, the inverted octahedral frustums were etched into inverted pyramidal frustums. Note that the C1\u2010 and C2-planes were etched away (Fig. 5e). By comparison, at 7\u202fmin, the inverted octahedral pyramid with C1\u2010 and C2-planes as observed in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution still existed, indicating that the 5\u202fwt% TMAH solution favors higher etching rate of C1- and C2-planes. In addition, the density of bulges on the etched bottom (100) plane of inverted frustums in 5\u202fwt% TMAH solution is much less than that in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution. At 8\u202fmin, the bottom (100) plane disappeared, and then inverted pyramidal frustums evolved into inverted pyramids composed of C3-planes (Fig. 5f). For the etching behavior in 10\u202fwt% TMAH solution, we found that the inverted octahedral frustums with (100), C2-, and C3-planes appeared at 1\u202fmin, then changed into inverted pyramidal frustums with C3-plane and bottom (100) plane at 4\u202fmin, finally into inverted pyramids composed of C3-planes at 9\u202fmin (Fig. 6a\u2013c). In contrast, the inverted pyramids in 15\u202fwt% TMAH solution appeared at the longer time of 11\u202fmin. It can be found that higher TMAH concentration favors slower evolution for inverted pyramids, which can be confidently attributed to the concentration dependent etching rate difference for various crystallographic planes. In addition, the C1- and C4-planes were not found for etched in both 10\u202fwt% and 15\u202fwt% TMAH solutions, which could be attributed to the higher etching rate of C1- and C4-planes than that of C2- and C3-planes, thus leading to faster evolution (being etched away completely). The etching rates of various crystallographic planes with different TMAH concentration will be accurately determined below. In addition, the etched bottom (100) plane in 10\u201315\u202fwt% TMAH solutions is much smoother than that in 1\u20135\u202fwt% solutions. The morphological evolution of PSiS etched in 20\u201325\u202fwt% TMAH solutions is similar to that in 10\u201315\u202fwt% TMAH solutions. As shown in the Fig. 7 , inverted octahedral frustums firstly changed into inverted pyramidal frustums, then into inverted pyramids. Nevertheless, the crystallographic evolution of PSiS etched in 20\u201325\u202fwt% TMAH solutions exhibits significant difference compared with that in 10\u201315\u202fwt% TMAH solutions. For instance, new tilted inward C5-plane above the C2-plane was found on the sidewall of inverted octahedral frustums in 20\u202fwt% and 25\u202fwt% TMAH solutions (see the inserts in Fig. 7a and e). Moreover, the C5-plane existed on the sidewall of inverted pyramidal frustum (see the inserts in Fig. 7c and g). Cross-section SEM image revealed that the slant angle of C5-plane is 94.1\u00b0 (Fig. 8 ). Similar tilted inward planes in the undercut convex corner under the etched (100) plane covered with inert mask have been found in 25\u202fwt% TMAH solution [31\u201333], however, the slant angle of the tilted inward planes against (100) plane and the Miller index were not given. The Miller index of C5-plane will be determined below. Moreover, the fact that the longer evolution time for inverted pyramids and the lower shrink rate of bottom (100) plane can be clearly observed for higher TMAH concentrations. Equipped with results above, it can be concluded in all TMAH solutions (1\u201325\u202fwt%) that etched Si patterns finally evolved into the inverted pyramids comprising of C3-plane which shows the lowest etching rate as the most stable crystallographic plane [30,34]. Note that C4-plane only appeared in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution, and C1-plane merely appeared in the etchant with low TMAH concentration of 1\u20135\u202fwt%. Moreover, the tilted inward C5-plane was found in the etchant with higher TMAH concentration of 20\u201325\u202fwt%. Note that the bugles on the etched (100) plane were only created in 1\u202fwt% and 5\u202fwt% TMAH water solutions, and disappeared with increasing TMAH concentration. The fact that lower TMAH concentration results in poor roughness of etched (100) plane has also been reported elsewhere [28].Therefore, it is clearly demonstrated that the concentration of TMAH significantly affects the crystallographic evolution of PSiS. As demonstrated above, the C1-, C2-, C3-, C4-, and C5-planes exhibit constant crystallographic orientation relative to the known [011\u00af] orientation and invariable slant angle against the bottom (100) plane, thus these planes are identified as specific crystallographic planes. Based on the dimensional analyses through SEM and AFM characterizations, the Miller indexes of these crystallographic planes were then determined following similar procedure reported before [35]. The inverted octahedral frustums etched in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution for 5\u202fmin are chosen to determine the Miller index of C2-plane. According to the known [010] orientation (Fig. 9a), the Miller indexes of C1-, C2, and C5-plane are thus assigned to be {h10} [25]. An inverted octahedral frustum model together with a coordinate system (Fig. 8b) is created to determine the intercepts of C2-plane along x-, y-, and z-axes. Note that the x-, y-, and z-axes indicate the corresponding crystallographic orientations of [100], [010] and [001]. The intercepts of C2-plane along x- and y- axes are measured to be \u22121.82\u202f\u03bcm and 1.82\u202f\u03bcm. And the C2-plane is parallel to the z-axis. Then, the reciprocals of the values measured above are calculated to derive the Miller index of C2-plane\u2014{1\u00af10}. Then, the Miller index of the C1-plane is determined. As discussed above, the C1-plane with a slant angle of 53.2\u00b0 is assigned to be {h10} plane. The angle (\u03c6) between. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "(h 1 k 1 l 1) and (h 2 k 2 l 2) crystallographic planes in a face center cubic (FCC) crystal can be calculated using the following Eq. (1). \u03c6=cos\u22121h1h2+k1k2+l1l2h12+k12+l12h22+k22+l22 According to the observation that the angle between the {3\u00af40} plane and (100) plane is 53.2\u00b0, the Miller index of the C1-planes is thus determined to be {3\u00af40}. Similarly, for the tilted inward C5-plane with the slant angle of 94.1\u00b0 (Fig. 9), the Miller index of C5-plane is then determined to be {1 14 0}. For C4-plane, according to the known [011\u00af] orientation, the C3- and C4-planes can be assigned to be {h11\u00af} planes. Because the slant angle of C4-plane is 35.1\u00b0, the Miller index of C4-plane is then derived to be {2\u00af11\u00af}. And the C3-plane of inverted pyramid has been determined to be {111} plane [36]. To our best knowledge, for the first time the two high Miller index planes {3\u00af40} C1-plane and {1 14 0} C5-plane appear in TMAH etchant. The variation of morphological and crystallographic evolutions of PSiS in the etchants with varying TMAH concentration can be attributed to the different concentration dependence of the etching capability of various crystallographic planes. To confirm this, we determined and compared the etching rates of exposed crystallographic planes in the etchant with varying TMAH concentration based on SEM and AFM results. Note that the absolute etching rate of the bottom (100) plane is an essential reference for determining the etching rate of other slant planes. Firstly, the time-dependent depth of inverted frustums is determined using AFM for 1\u202fwt%, 5\u202fwt%, 10\u202fwt%, 15\u202fwt%, 20\u202fwt%, and 25\u202fwt% TMAH solutions. As shown in Fig. 10a, the depth increases linearly with etching time. Under the same etching time, the depth of inverted frustums decreases with TMAH concentration. The etching rate of (100) plane, i.e., is the ratio of the depth to the etching time, for varying TMAH concentration are determined: 1\u202fwt% (512.4\u202fnm/min), 5\u202fwt% (482.1\u202fnm/min), 10\u202fwt% (450.2\u202fnm/min), 15\u202fwt% (427.1\u202fnm/min), 20\u202fwt% (379.2\u202fnm/min), and 25\u202fwt% (253.9\u202fnm/min). Consequently, a higher TMAH concentration of the etchant favors a smaller etching rate of the bottom (100) plane (Fig. 10b). As reported, the etching rate of (100) Si plane decreased with TMAH concentration ranging from 10\u202fwt% to 25\u202fwt% [23], which is consistent with the dependence of the etching rate for (100) plane on TMAH concentration (1\u201325\u202fwt%) concluded in our results. Then, the etching rates of other crystallographic planes are determined based on AFM characterization and the etching rate of bottom (100) plane determined above. The procedures for deriving the etching rates of C1- and C2-planes are as follows. The inverted octahedral frustums etched in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution for 3\u202fmin and 5\u202fmin are chosen to determine the etching rate of C1- and C2-planes (V C1 and V C2). According to the AFM line profile analyses of the inverted octahedral frustums (Fig. 11b and e), a schematic model is then constructed to determine the V C1 and V C2 (Fig. 11c and f). The V C1 and V C2 can be calculated by the following Eqs. (2) and (3): VC1=\u2206DC1\u2206t=\u2206WC1sin53.2\u00b0\u2206t VC2=\u2206DC2\u2206t=\u2206D100cos45.0\u00b0\u2212\u2206WC2sin45.0\u00b0\u2206t where \u0394D C1, \u0394D C2, and \u0394D (100) are the distance between the parallel C1-planes, C2-planes, and (100) planes etched for 3\u202fmin and 5\u202fmin. Finally, the etching rates of C1- and C2-planes in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution are calculated to be 230.6\u202fnm/min and 92.0\u202fnm/min. Following the similar procedure, the etching rates of C3- and C4-planes in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution are then determined to be 5.43\u202fnm/min and 327.3\u202fnm/min. It can thus be concluded that the etching rates of various crystallographic planes in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution follow the order: V (100)\u202f>\u202fV C4\u202f>\u202fV C1\u202f>\u202fV C2\u202f>\u202fV C3. As expected, the most stable C3-plane\u2014(111) plane\u2014exhibits smallest etching rate among all exposed crystallographic planes, thus contributing to longer lifetime and the final morphology of the inverted pyramid composed of C3-plane [37,38]. Note that the etching rate of the bottom (100) plane is much higher than all sidewall crystallographic planes. Thus, the sharp increase of the depth of inverted frustums causes the slower evolution of C1-, C2-, C3-, and C4-planes with constant slant angle, which contributes to a wider spectrum of the crystallographic evolutions and results in the formation of inverted octahedral frustums/pyramids. Moreover, the etching rates of C1-, C2-, C3-, C4-, and C5-planes with different TMAH concentrations are determined and compared (Fig. 12a). It can be found that higher TMAH concentration favors larger etching rates of C1-, C2-, and C3-planes, and conversely smaller etching rate of the bottom (100) plane. Note that the C1-plane only appears for 1\u202fwt% and 5\u202fwt% TMAH solution. The etching rate of C1-plane increase with TMAH concentration, we thus propose that the highest etching rate of C1-plane with larger TMAH concentration causes the fast evolution and disappearance of C1-plane. The etching rate of C5-plane decreases with TMAH concentration (20\u201325\u202fwt%), thus leading to prolonged existence for C5-plane in 25\u202fwt% TMAH solution. The ratio of the etching rate of C2- and C3-planes to (100) plane (V Cx/V (100), x\u202f=\u202f2 and 3) is also determined to gain insights into the underlying mechanism for TMAH concentration dependence of the morphological evolution. As shown in Fig. 12b, the ratio value of V Cx/V (100) is higher for larger TMAH concentration, indicating that larger TMAH concentration favors larger difference in the etching rate between the slant planes (C2- and C3-planes) and the bottom (100) plane owing to the slower downward etching of the bottom (100) plane and conversely faster lateral etching of the slant planes, thus leading to lower shrinkage of the bottom (100) plane and slower evolution for the inverted frustums and pyramids. In Fig. 13 , schematic pictures are drawn to illustrate the stronger depth-specific etching for the bottom (100) plane at lower TMAH concentration versus the stronger slant-plane etching at higher TMAH concentration. The crystallographic model illustrates the experimental findings that higher TMAH concentration favors larger ratio of the etched depth of the slant planes (\u0394D S-H) to that of bottom (100) plane (\u0394D (100)-H), i.e., \u0394D S-H/\u0394D (100)-H\u202f>\u202f\u0394D S-L/\u0394D (100)-L, or equivalently larger etching rate ratio (VS-H/V. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "(100)H\u202f>\u202fVS-L/V (100)L). It is thus clearly revealed that higher TMAH concentration favors stronger slant-plane etching of inverted frustums and pyramids, and weaker depth-specific etching of the bottom (100) plane, thus leading to slower shrinkage of bottom (100) plane and larger etched depth of slant planes due to the anisotropic etching difference of TMAH etchant. On the contrary, for lower TMAH concentration, stronger depth-specific etching capability of the bottom (100) plane and weaker slant-plane etching of inverted frustums and pyramids are observed, thus contributing to the rapid shrinkage of the bottom (100) plane. Therefore, higher TMAH concentration favors larger inverted frustums and pyramids owing to stronger undercut etching of slant planes under the SiO2 mask, as well as slower morphological evolution to the inverted pyramids. In this study, the morphological and crystallographic evolutions of PSiS etched in varying TMAH concentration (1\u201325\u202fwt%) have been studied using a suitable model system of the (100) Si substrate with circular aperture SiO2 mask. The circular-shaped mask is advantageous over other mask shape such as square and parallelogram mask thanks to the equal etching probability of various crystallographic planes [39]. This advantage makes the substrate more suitable for studying the morphological and crystallographic evolutions of Si etched in TMAH solution. It was clearly demonstrated that the TMAH concentration significantly affects the time-dependent morphological and crystallographic evolutions of wet-etched PSiS. For instance, the fastest morphological evolutions of PSiS were achieved in the etchant with TMAH concentration as low as 1\u202fwt%. A full spectrum of morphological evolution including the rounded apertures, inverted octahedral frustums, octahedral pyramids, and pyramids, was revealed. Moreover, the widest spectrum of the crystallographic evolutions in 1\u202fwt% TMAH solution were revealed, i.e., C1 {3\u00af40}, C2 {1\u00af10}, C3 {1\u00af11\u00af}, C4 {2\u00af11\u00af} planes, which will contribute to fabrication of sophisticated 3D microstructures with specific morphology, dimension, and crystallographic plane. In contrast, higher TMAH concentration favors smoother surface of crystallographic planes and larger inverted frustums or pyramids. A thorough understanding about the etching mechanism of PSiS will be an important step towards controllable fabrication of sophisticated 3D microstructures and Si-based optoelectronic devices with enhanced performance.  In this paper, using the (100) Si substrate with circular aperture SiO2 mask as a model system, we systematically investigated the morphological and crystallographic evolutions of PSiS in the TMAH etchants with varying concentration (1\u201325\u202fwt%). SEM and AFM characterization clearly demonstrated that both the etching time and TMAH concentration significantly affect the morphological and crystallographic evolutions of PSiS. For the etchant with high TMAH concentration of 5\u201325\u202fwt%, inverted octahedral frustums are firstly created, then change into inverted pyramidal frustums, finally into inverted pyramids. In contrast, for TMAH concentration as low as 1\u202fwt%, rounded aperture patterns are firstly created, subsequently evolve into inverted octahedral frustums, then into inverted octahedral pyramids, finally into inverted pyramids. A series of high and low Miller index crystallographic planes\u2014C1 {3\u00af40}, C2 {1\u00af10}, C3 {1\u00af11\u00af}, C4 {2\u00af11\u00af}, and C5 {1 14 0} planes, appear due to anisotropic crystallographic etching. Higher TMAH concentration favors larger etching rates of C1-, C2-, and C3-planes, and conversely smaller etching rate of the bottom (100) plane. The clear relationship between the etching rate of crystallographic planes and morphological evolution was established. Higher TMAH concentration favors slower shrinkage of bottom (100) plane and smaller vertical extension speed of slant planes, as well as larger inverted frustums and pyramids due to the anisotropic etching capability difference of TMAH etchant for various crystallographic planes. The thorough understanding about the wet etching mechanism of PSiS will contribute to the controllable fabrication of sophisticated 3D microstructures for Si-based optoelectronic devices with enhanced performance.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Due to their unique structures, 2D materials exhibit many physical and chemical properties that differ from ordinary materials [9]. For example, graphene has excellent electron transport properties, with an electron mobility 100 times higher than that of conventional silicon materials [10]. 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have strong exciton luminescence characteristics in the near infrared region, providing a novel material for new light-emitting devices [3]. Increasing research has demonstrated that 2D materials have considerable potential in applications for photoelectric detectors, gas sensitive detectors, diodes, transistors, memristors, solar cells, LEDs, electrocatalysts, and photocatalysts. However, 2D materials\u2019 inherent defects limit their application. Graphene\u2019s zero band gap electronic structure leads to lower switching ratios and shorter carrier lifetimes, limiting its applications for transistors and light-emitting devices [11]. TMDCs\u2019 carrier mobility is too low for use in high-performance devices, despite their direct band gap [12]. Although it has a high carrier mobility, black phosphorus is easily oxidized in the air and becomes unstable, which seriously deteriorates its properties [13]. Developing new 2D materials with good properties and stable structures is necessary. Benefiting from flexible bond hybridization, carbon allotropes cover the entire range of human understanding of spatial structure, from zero-dimensional (0D) fullerenes to three-dimensional (3D) diamond and graphite [14\u201321]. To date, numerous 2D carbon materials have been reported with distinct electronic properties including superconductivity and metallic and semi-metallic characteristics for use in topological insulators, semiconductors, and insulators. Notable examples include graphdiyne [22], TAL-carbon [4], T-graphene [23], TPH-graphene, phagraphene [24,25], C-57 carbon [26], E-graphene [27], twin graphene [28], \u03b1-graphyne, \u03b2-graphyne, \u03b3-graphyne [29], \u03c8-graphene [30], twin T-graphene [31], C33-carbon [32], hP-C18 [33], PBCF-graphene [34], and THD-graphene [35]. However, only a few have been experimentally synthesized, such as graphdiyne and phagraphene. Thus, more effective strategies must be developed for designing 2D carbon materials. Many previous studies have demonstrated that carbon sheets consisting of pentagon-heptagon defects are formed by the Stone-Wales (SW) transformation of bonds in a certain sequence [36,37]. In 2011, 2D graphene with Stone-Wales defects has been synthesized in experiments [38]. Using stochastic groups and graph-constrained searches, Yin et al. [39] predicted a stable 2D carbon allotrope, called Stone-Wales graphene, consisting of well-arranged Stone-Wales defects. This carbon sheet can be constructed using a 90\u00b0 bond rotation in a 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 graphene supercell with energy only 149\u00a0meV higher than graphene. Centre et al. [40] predicted a sp 2-hybridized 2D carbon allotrope, called pentahexoctite, which consists of continuous 5-6-8 rings of carbon atoms and can also be derived from graphene by the SW transformation. This carbon sheet is metallic and can be rolled into stable nanotubes. Applying the SW transformation to two of the bonds in a square unit cell of penta-graphene [41], Ram et al. [42] predicted a unique network of tetra- and hexa-rings called tetrahexcarbon. Tetrahexcarbon is composed of sp 2\u00a0+\u00a0sp 3-hybridized carbon atoms and is 0.04\u00a0eV/atoms lower than penta-graphene. In this study, we designed two stable 2D carbon allotropes, TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon, by applying the SW transformation to penta-graphene. First-principles calculations indicate that these carbon sheets are energetically and mechanically superior to penta-graphene and tetrahexcarbon. The electronic structure calculations show that they have tunable direct band gaps under uniaxial strain. These carbon sheets exhibit extraordinarily high carrier mobility and strong exciton absorption for photons in visible light. In addition, both TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon are anisotropic materials, which are reflected in their mechanical, transport, and optical properties.  All of the first-principles calculations were conducted using density functional theory (DFT) [43] within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [44] function as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [45,46]. Projector-augmented wave (PAW) [47] pseudopotentials were used to describe the interactions between valence electrons and ions. The wave functions were expanded with a cut-off energy of 600\u00a0eV. For structural optimization, the Brillouin zones (BZ) were represented by Monkhorst-Pack special k-point meshes [48] of 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 and 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 for TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon, respectively. An adequate vacuum of 20\u00a0\u00c5 along the z-axis was set to minimize the interaction between adjacent images. To geometrically optimize the unit cell, the total energy convergence was set as 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 eV and the atomic convergence force was set as 0.001\u00a0eV/\u00c5. To better predict the band gap, the hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) [49\u201351] method was used to calculate the electronic band structures and density of states. The coordinates of the high-symmetry k-points used for the band calculation were \u0393 (0, 0, 0)\u00a0>\u00a0Y (\u22120.5, 0, 0)\u00a0>\u00a0S (\u22120.5, 0.5, 0)\u00a0>\u00a0X (0, 0.5, 0)\u00a0>\u00a0\u0393. To study the dynamic stability, their phonon dispersions were calculated using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) as implemented in the PHONOPY code [52], with the forces calculated from VASP within a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 supercell. To examine the structure\u2019s thermal stability, we applied ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using a canonical (NVT) ensemble [53]. For the optical response of TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon, dielectric functions were computed using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) [54,55] on top of the partial self-consistent G0W0 calculation [56\u201358]. To attain the converged dielectric function, 400 unoccupied bands were used. All occupied bands and 48 unoccupied bands were included to build the electron-hole interaction kernel. To calculated the converged optical spectra, two fine k-points grids of 32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a026\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 and 30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a028\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 were used for TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon, respectively. In addition, since the spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) effect in carbon materials is so weak that can be ignored, we have not performed SOC in this work.  Among the known 2D carbon allotropes, penta-graphene has a unique phase composed entirely of carbon pentagons, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Penta-graphene exhibits a 1.2\u00a0\u00c5 thick layer-type structure with sp 3-hybridized C1 atoms (cyan spheres) sandwiched between two layers of sp 2-hybridized C2 atoms (brown spheres). In this study, the optimized lattice parameters and total layer thickness of penta-graphene are a 0\u00a0=\u00a0b 0\u00a0=\u00a03.632\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.210\u00a0\u00c5, respectively, consistent with prior research [41]. To clearly explain the phase transition of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "penta-graphene, a rectangular unit cell containing 12 carbon atoms with lattice constant a 1\u00a0=\u00a0b 1\u00a0=\u00a05.135\u00a0\u00c5 is redefined, as shown in light yellow in Fig. 1(a). By applying the SW transformation, the connectivity of two sp 2-hybridized carbon atoms in a penta-graphene unit cell was rotated by 90\u00b0 with respect to their bond\u2019s midpoint (Fig. 1(a)), forming a sp 2\u00a0+\u00a0sp 3-hybridized carbon allotrope composed of tetra-, penta-, and hexa-rings of carbon atoms, known as TPH-I carbon (Fig. 1(b)). TPH-I carbon possesses Pmm2 symmetry (space group no. 25) with an orthorhombic lattice. Its optimized lattice parameters are a 2\u00a0=\u00a04.832\u00a0\u00c5 and b 2\u00a0=\u00a05.561\u00a0\u00c5, and c 2\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0\u00c5 was set. The 12 carbon atoms in the TPH-I carbon\u2019s unit cell are divided into five kinds of inequivalent atoms occupying different Wyckoff positions: C1 4i (0.26078, 0.23268, and 0.50114), C2 2e (0.13913, 0, and 0.47486), C3 2h (0.5, 0.87874, and 0.54512), C4 2h (0.5, 0.37937, and 0.4721), and C5 2\u00a0g (0, 0.37951, and 0.51538) as denoted by the different spheres in Fig. 1(b). In the TPH-I carbon, the C1 atoms are sp 3-hybridized carbon atoms, while the C2, C3, C4, and C5 atoms are presented in the form of sp 2 hybridization. The bond lengths of the neighboring sp 2-hybridized carbon atoms of TPH-I carbon are 1.337\u20131.348\u00a0\u00c5, which showed pronounced characteristics of carbon double bonds. The bond lengths of the neighboring sp 2- and sp 3-hybridized carbon atoms of TPH-I carbon are 1.513\u20131.574\u00a0\u00c5, showing pronounced characteristics of carbon single bonds. The connectivity of two neighboring sp 2-hybridized C3 atoms of TPH-I carbon was rotated by 90\u00b0 with respect to their bond\u2019s midpoint (Fig. 1(b)), forming TPH-II carbon (Fig. 1(c)). Similar to TPH-I carbon, TPH-II carbon is a 2D network of tetra-, penta-, and hexa-rings composed of sp 2\u00a0+\u00a0sp 3-hybridized carbon atoms, as shown in Fig. 1(c). TPH-II carbon has a Pmma space-group symmetry (space group no. 51) with 12 carbon atoms in an orthorhombic unit cell. After the complete relaxation, its lattice parameters are a 3\u00a0=\u00a04.943\u00a0\u00c5 and b 3\u00a0=\u00a05.371\u00a0\u00c5, and c 3\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0\u00c5 was set. In the TPH-II carbon\u2019s unit cell, there were three kinds of crystallographic inequivalent carbon positions: C1 4h (0.5, 0.27641, and 0.5), C2 4k (0.75, 0.12554, and 0.51304), and C3 4j (0.8805, 0.5, and 0.4587), in which C1 is sp 3-hybridized carbon atoms and the other two are sp 2-hybridized carbon atoms. The C1-C2 (1.479\u00a0\u00c5) and C1-C3 (1.557\u00a0\u00c5) bond lengths of the TPH-II carbon show pronounced carbon single bond characteristics, while the C2-C2 (1.346\u00a0\u00c5) and C3-C3 (1.361\u00a0\u00c5) bond lengths demonstrate pronounced carbon double bond characteristics. The bond angles in TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are in range of 82.734\u2013135.004\u00b0 and 79.322\u2013127.975\u00b0 respectively, distinctly different from 109.47\u00b0 in diamond and 120\u00b0 in graphene. Structural details of TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are given in Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 of the Supplementary materials. The chemical bonding TPH-I and TPH-II carbon can be well-understand through the electron localization function (ELF), as shown in Fig. S3 of the Supplementary materials. Great amount of electrons localization between the neighboring carbon atoms, illustrate the strong covalent bonding nature between all carbon atoms. Similar to penta-graphene, the side views of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon show multilayered structures with four coordinated carbon atoms (denoted as cyan spheres in Fig. 1(a\u2013c)) in the middle layer between three coordinated carbon atoms. The optimized total layer thicknesses of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are 1.467 and 1.649\u00a0\u00c5, respectively, larger than that of penta-graphene. The planar densities of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are 0.446 and 0.452 atom/\u00c5, respectively, which did not deviate significantly from that of penta-graphene (0.453 atom/\u00c5). To investigate the thermodynamic stability of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon, their total energies are calculated, together with several previously reported carbon allotropes for comparison, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The total energies of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are respectively 0.827 and 0.765\u00a0eV/atom higher than that of graphene, which is probably due to the distortion of their bond angles. The TPH-II carbon have better thermodynamic stability than the TPH-I carbon. Although the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are metastable compared to graphene, they are energetically superior to E-graphene, twin T-graphene, C33-carbon, PBCF-graphene, and some successfully synthesized carbon allotropes such as T-carbon [59,60] and cyclo[18]carbon [61], indicating that they may be experimentally realized. The total energy of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are respectively 0.078 and 0.141\u00a0eV/atom lower than their parent sheet penta-graphene, and respectively 0.043 and 0.106\u00a0eV/atom lower than their brother sheet tetrahexcarbon. In terms of energy alone, it is possible to achieve penta-graphene to TPH-I and TPH-II carbon conversion through the SW transformation, which has more advantages than the penta-graphene-to-tetrahexcarbon conversion. To examine their dynamic stability, the phonon spectra and partial phonon density of states (PhDOS) of the TPH-I carbon (Fig. 2 (a)) and TPH-II carbon (Fig. 2(d)) are calculated. No imaginary frequencies occurred throughout the Brillouin zones, suggesting that the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are dynamically stable carbon phases. The highest phonon frequencies are 50.098 and 50.535 THz for the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon, respectively, which are slightly larger than\u00a0~48 THz found in graphene. The phonon spectra of the TPH-I carbon have a distinct phonon gap ranging from\u00a0~37 to\u00a0~47 THz and three isolated phonon bands in a range of\u00a0~47 to\u00a0~51 THz. The phonon spectra of the TPH-II carbon have two narrow phonon gaps in range of\u00a0~40 to\u00a0~43 THz and\u00a0~44 to\u00a0~48 THz, respectively. These characteristics will help identify new phases in future experiments. As the PhDOS demonstrated, their phonon modes above 40 THz originate from the vibrations of the sp 2-hybridized carbon atoms, while the phonon modes originating from the sp 3-hybridized carbon atoms are below 40 THz. To study the effect of equi-biaxial strain on their dynamical stability, we test the strain limits of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon by applying equi-biaxial tensile strain. As shown in Fig. 2(b), no phonon softening is observed in the whole Brillouin zone of the TPH-I carbon up to 13.7% of equi-biaxial strain. As the applied equi-biaxial strain reaches 13.8%, imaginary frequency occurs near the \u0393 point,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "suggesting that the TPH-I carbon is dynamically unstable. Therefore, TPH-I carbon can withstand up to 13.7% equi-biaxial strain and maintain dynamic stability. Similarly, the equi-biaxial strain limit of the TPH-II carbon reachs 15.5%, as shown in Fig. 2(e). The TPH-II carbon shows better mechanical stability than the TPH-I carbon. To study the effect of uniaxial strain on their dynamical stability, we further compute the phonons under increasing uniaxial tensile strain. The calculated phonons at the critical point of phonon softening are plotted in Fig. S4 of the Supplementary materials. We find that TPH-I carbon can withstand 18% (16%) uniaxial tensile strain loaded along the\u00a0x\u00a0(y) direction, while TPH-II carbon canwithstand up to 21% (12%) uniaxial tensile strain. Their excellent strain limits make them suitable for two-dimensional material strain engineering. To examine their thermal stability, we further conduct AIMD simulations using an NVT ensemble at 300\u00a0K and 500\u00a0K within a 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 supercell. The AIMD simulation results are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (f) for the TPH-I and TPH-II, respectively. During the heating process at 300\u00a0K and 500\u00a0K for 5\u00a0ps with a time step 1\u00a0fs, none of the C-C bonds broke and the total potential energy fluctuated around a steady level, indicating that the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are thermally stable at 300\u00a0K and 500\u00a0K. We also estimated their mechanical stability by calculating the change of energy caused by in-plane strain. For a 2D material, the relationship between strain energy and in-plane strain can be expressed as follows: [62] E(\u03b5)-E0=12C11\u03b5xx2+12C22\u03b5yy2+C12\u03b5xx\u03b5yy+2C44\u03b5xy2 where E 0 and E(\u03b5) are the total energy per area without strain and after strain, respectively. \u03b5xx and \u03b5yy are uniaxial strains along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions, respectively. \u03b5xy is the equi-biaxial tensile strain. C 11, C 22, C 12, and C 44 are components of the elastic modulus tensor and were obtained by fitting the energy curves related to the strain. The calculated strain energy curves related to the strain for the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. For a mechanically stable 2D material, its elastic constants need to satisfy the Born-Huang criteria [63] of C 44\u00a0>\u00a00 and C 11 C 22-C 2 12\u00a0>\u00a00. After fitting a second-order polynomial to the energy data with deformations, their elastic constants are C 11\u00a0=\u00a0280, C 22\u00a0=\u00a0303, C 12\u00a0=\u00a018, and C 44\u00a0=\u00a0133\u00a0N/m for the TPH-I carbon and C 11\u00a0=\u00a0292, C 22\u00a0=\u00a0324, C 12\u00a0=\u00a027, and C 44\u00a0=\u00a0134\u00a0N/m for the TPH-II carbon, satisfying the mechanical stability criteria. Using the same method, we also calculated the elastic constants of their parent and brother sheets, which are C 11\u00a0=\u00a0C 22\u00a0=\u00a0264 N/m for penta-graphene and C 11\u00a0=\u00a0288 and C 22\u00a0=\u00a0281 N/m for tetrahexcarbon, consistent with previously reported research [41,42]. The TPH-I and TPH-II carbon have higher elastic constants than their parent and brother sheets, proving that their mechanical properties are significantly improved and they became stiffer. Based on the elastic constants, the in-plane Young's modulus and Poisson ratio along an arbitrary direction \u03b8 can be expressed as:[62] E(\u03b8)=C11C22-C122C11\u03b14+C22\u03b24+(C11C22-C122C44-2C12)\u03b12\u03b22, v(\u03b8)=-(C11+C22-C11C22-C122C44)\u03b12\u03b22-C12(\u03b14+\u03b24)C11\u03b14+C22\u03b24+(C11C22-C122C44-2C12)\u03b12\u03b22. where \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0sin \u03b8 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0cos \u03b8. Fig. 3(c) and (d) respectively represent the angular-dependent in-plane Young's modulus and Poisson ratio. The 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 angles correspond to the directions along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y axes of the orthorhombic unit cell, respectively. The distorted circles shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) demonstrate that TPH-I and TPH-II carbon have varying degrees of mechanical anisotropy. TPH-II carbon has a higher Young's modulus than TPH-I carbon (Fig. 3(c)). Their largest Young's modulus are in the y axis, which are 302\u00a0 and 322\u00a0N/m for the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon, respectively. Their smallest Young's modulus are in the\u00a0x\u00a0axis, which are 278\u00a0 and 290\u00a0N/m for the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon, respectively. The Young's modulus of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are higher than that of penta-graphene (263.8\u00a0N/m) [41] and more than four-fifths that of graphene (354\u00a0N/m) [62], showing an in-plane stiffness superior to penta-graphene and comparable to graphene. TPH-II carbon also has higher Poisson ratio than TPH-I carbon (Fig. 3(d)), suggesting that TPH-II carbon is more likely to expand laterally than the TPH-I carbon when tensile force is applied. The minimum in-plane Poisson ratios occur when they are stretched along the\u00a0x\u00a0axis, which are 0.059 and 0.083 for the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon, respectively. The maximum values occur when they are stretched along the diagonal direction, which are 0.074 and 0.110 for the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon, respectively. Compared with the v\u00a0=\u00a00.17 of graphene [62], the in-plane Poisson ratios of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are much lower, showing that TPH-I and TPH-II carbon will contract more slightly in their lateral lattices than graphene when their longitudinal lattices are stretched. In addition to the in-plane stiffness, we further studied the variations in the stress with the uniaxial and equi-biaxial strain of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon. The calculated stress\u2013strain curves of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are plotted in Fig. 3(e) and (f), respectively. The ultimate strength of the TPH-I carbon is 39.1\u00a0N/m (35.7\u00a0N/m) occurring with 25% (18%) uniaxial strain loaded along the\u00a0x\u00a0(y) direction. The ultimate strength of TPH-II carbon is 35.1\u00a0N/m (35.96\u00a0N/m) occurring with 27% (18%) uniaxial strain loaded along the\u00a0x\u00a0(y) direction. The TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon possesses similar and good uniaxial strain limits. The calculated equi-biaxial strain at the maximum strength for TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are 14% and 16%, respectively, slightly higher than the phonon spectrum\u2019s strain limit. Therefore, TPH-I and TPH-II carbon possess favorable mechanical properties and are suitable for nanomechanical applications. We then explored the electronic properties of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon through the orbital projected band structure along with the angular momentum resolved density of states (LDOS) and band decomposed charge densities (BDCD) at conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM). The calculated results of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are plotted in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively. From the projected band structure in Fig. 4(a), both the CBM and VBM locate at \u0393-symmetric points with band gap of 2.704\u00a0eV, making the TPH-I carbon a direct band gap semiconductor. The LDOS analysis shows that. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the CBM of the TPH-I carbon mainly originates from the C3-p z orbital and a small amount of C5-p z orbital, while its VBM mainly originates from the C3-p z and C4-p z orbitals and a small amount of C2-p z orbital. These are also reflected in the charge density lobes (yellow lobes) of the BDCD. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the TPH-II carbon is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.361\u00a0eV because the CBM is on the S-X path whereas the VBM locates at \u0393-symmetric points. However, because the second minimum of the lowest unoccupied band (located at \u0393-symmetric points) is only 35\u00a0meV higher than the CBM, the TPH-II carbon can also be considered a quasi-direct band gap semiconductor. As shown in the BDCD, the CBM and VBM of the TPH-II carbon mainly originates from the C3-pz orbital. Both the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon transformed from penta-graphene through the SW transformation have lower band gaps than the parent sheet (3.25\u00a0eV). The transition from penta-graphene to TPH-I carbon realizes the modulation from an indirect band gap to a direct band gap. To study the effect of uniaxial strain on the electronic properties, we then calculate their band structures (computed using the HSE06 functional) with uniaxial strain up to 10% and step lengths of 1%. The calculated band structures with uniaxial strain of 0%, 5%, and 10% along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions together with the band gap curves with the strain of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), respectively. As demonstrated in Fig. 5(a), the TPH-I carbon\u2019s band gap under strain remains direct. The strain applied along the y direction increases the band gap, which reached a maximum value 2.812\u00a0eV with 7% strain, while the strain applied along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction reduces the band gap to 2.441\u00a0eV (with 10% strain). Therefore, TPH-I carbon have a tunable direct band gap in a range of 2.441\u20132.812\u00a0eV after applying 0%-10% uniaxial strain. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the band gap tunable amplitude of the TPH-II carbon is greater than that of TPH-I carbon. As the applied strain along the y direction increased, the TPH-II carbon\u2019s band gap rapidly shrank to 0.915\u00a0eV (with 10% strain). Interestingly, the band gap is transformed from an indirect to a direct band gap when more than 2% of the strain is applied along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction. Therefore, TPH-II carbon also had a tunable direct band gap of 2.468\u20132.7562\u00a0eV after applying 2%-10% strain along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction. The tunable direct band gap characteristics of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon give them an advantage in the field of nanoelectronic devices with tunable band gap under mechanical strain. Mobility is a key parameter for characterizing the carrier transport performance of semiconductor materials. Considering that phonon scattering is the main mechanism limiting carrier mobility of intrinsic semiconductors, we further calculated their carrier mobility based on the effective mass approximation and electron-acoustic phonon scattering. The carrier mobility of a 2D system can be calculated using the expression:[64,65] \u03bc2D=e\u01273C2DkBTme\u2217m\u2217E12 where C 2D is the in-plane elastic constant along the transport directions. The effective mass m* can be calculated by fitting the band dispersion at the VBM (for the hole effective mass) and CBM (for the electron effective mass):[33] m\u2217=\u01272(\u22022E(k)\u2202k2)-1 me\u2217=mx\u2217my\u2217 is the average effective mass, where mx and my represent the effective masses along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions, respectively. E1=\u0394E\u0394l/l0 is the deformation potential constant. \u0394E is the energy change of the band edges (E CBM for the electrons and E VBM for the holes) with respect to the vacuum energy (E vacuum) as induced under uniaxial compression and dilatation (using a step of 0.25%) along the transport directions. l and l 0 are the lattice parameters with or without strain, respectively. E 1 x and E 1 y represent the deformation potential constants along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions, respectively. Fig. 6 (a)\u2013(d) present the energy variations of the CBM and VBM with uniaxial strain of the TPH-I carbon and Fig. 6(e)\u2013(h) of the TPH-II carbon. In this study, we predicted the transport properties of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon at room temperature (T\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0K) and summarized the results in Table 1 , together with that of tetrahexcarbon for comparison. The results of the tetrahexcarbon matche previously reported results [66]. Our predicted effective mass, deformation potential constant, and mobility clearly show anisotropy along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions. For the TPH-I carbon, the electron mobility along the y direction (79,000\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) is nearly 13 times the value along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction (6063\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121), while the hole mobility along the y direction (3244\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) is nearly 35 times the value along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction (93\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121). For the TPH-II carbon, the electron mobility along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction (1417\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) is nearly 3.5 times the value along the y direction (394\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121), while the hole mobility along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction (14,632\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) is nearly 46 times the value along the y direction (318\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121). Unexpectedly, TPH-I carbon possesses extraordinarily high electron mobility along the y direction, while the TPH-II carbon possesses high hole mobility along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction. The TPH-I carbon\u2019s extraordinarily large electron mobility value is a consequence of the extremely small deformation potential constant along the y direction (E 1 y\u00a0=\u00a00.40\u00a0eV), which indicated weak electron phonon scattering, whereas the TPH-II carbon\u2019s large hole mobility value is due to the small hole effective mass (mx*/m 0\u00a0=\u00a00.30) and small deformation potential constant (E 1 x\u00a0=\u00a01.56\u00a0eV) along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction. The predicted electron mobility of the TPH-I carbon is nearly 70 times the value of black phosphorene (1100\u20131140\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) [65], 47 times higher than \u03b1-CNH (1671.51\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) [67], and 21 times higher than its brother sheet tetrahexcarbon (in this study: 3688\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121; reported result: 3682\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) [66]. The predicted hole mobility of the TPH-II carbon is comparable to that of black phosphorene (10,000\u201326,000\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) [65], 20 times the value of tetrahexcarbon (in this study: 719\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121; reported result: 721\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) [66], and 29 times higher than MoS2 (~500\u00a0cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121) [12]. The directional-dependent superior transport of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the electrons and holes make TPH-I and TPH-II carbon potential 2D materials for applications in high-performance electronic devices. The transition of electrons in the direct band gap does not require the participation of phonons, which not only avoids a thick absorption layer to provide the necessary phonon moment, but also increases a material\u2019s optical response. TPH-I and TPH-II carbon have direct and quasi-direct band gaps, respectively, which may give them unique optical properties, similar to 2D direct band gap semiconductor graphdiyne and MoS2. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) display the components of the imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function \u03b5 2(\u03c9) of the TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon as a function of the photon energy, respectively. The solar spectrum is divided into three regions: an infrared region (0\u20131.6\u00a0eV), a visible region (1.6\u20133.2\u00a0eV), and an ultraviolet region (3.2\u20136\u00a0eV). As illustrated in Fig. 7, \u03b5 2(\u03c9) has a considerable value for photons at visible light. For the TPH-I carbon, the position of the first absorption peak along the y direction is located at visible light of\u00a0~2.4\u00a0eV, whereas along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction, the first absorption peak is located at an ultraviolet region of\u00a0~3.5\u00a0eV. For TPH-II carbon, the first absorption peaks along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions are both located at visible light of\u00a0~2.2\u00a0eV and\u00a0~3.0\u00a0eV, respectively. The first absorption peaks demonstrate that the optical gaps of the TPH-I and TPH-II carbon were\u00a0~2.4 and\u00a0~2.2\u00a0eV, respectively, which are clearly smaller than their energy band gaps. This may have been due to the presence of a strong exciton effect, which causes the photons in the low energy region to also excite the exciton transition. The strong optical responses in visible light make TPH-I and TPH-II carbon potential 2D materials for applications in thin-film solar cells or photovoltaic devices. Our predicted optical properties clearly show anisotropy along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions. The anisotropic optical properties along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions allow the optical determination of the crystalline orientation. TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon have moderate band gap semiconductor nature, which points that that they may have potential for photocatalytic water splitting. The two prerequisites for materials to be used as photocatalyst for water splitting reaction are: the reduction potential (E H+/H2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.44\u00a0eV at pH 0) of water must below the conduction band edge (CBM with respect to the vacuum level) of materials and the valence band edge (VBM with respect to the vacuum level) of materials below the oxidation potential (E O2/H2O\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.67\u00a0eV at pH 0) of water. The band edges with respect to the vacuum level of TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon are plotted in Fig. 7(c). Since the values E H+/H2 and E O2/H2O lie inside the bandgap of TPH-I carbon, which means that TPH-I carbon is a potential photocatalyst for the water splitting reaction. The valence band edge of TPH-II carbon higher than the oxidation potential, indicating that it is not suitable as a photocatalyst for water splitting reaction.  Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that penta-graphene can be transformed into two metastable and sp 2\u00a0+\u00a0sp 3-hybridized carbon sheets, TPH-I and TPH-II carbon, through the Stone-Wales transformation. Both carbon sheets are composed of tetra-, penta-, and hexa-rings of carbon atoms and have orthorhombic lattices. TPH-I and TPH-II carbon are anisotropic materials. Compared with previously reported penta-graphene, tetrahexcarbon, and many other 2D sheets, these sheets are energetically favorable and have enhanced mechanical properties that may be suitable for nanomechanical applications. TPH-I carbon has a direct band gap of 2.704\u00a0eV, which can remain direct under uniaxial strain up to 10% along the\u00a0x\u00a0and y directions. TPH-II carbon has a quasi-direct band gap of 2.361\u00a0eV, which can be transformed to direct by applying strain along the\u00a0x\u00a0direction. Their tunable direct band gap properties give them considerable potential for applications in nanoelectronic devices. They significantly outperform tetrahexcarbon, black phosphorus, and monolayer MoS2 due to their extremely high carrier mobility, and TPH-I carbon and TPH-II carbon possess extraordinarily high electron and hole mobilities, respectively. For photons in visible light, their optical spectra show strong exciton absorption, making them potential 2D materials for applications in thin-film solar cells and photovoltaic devices. Optical anisotropy can be utilized to determine the crystalline orientation. The band edge positions of TPH-I carbon satisfy the energy levels required for the water splitting reaction. All of these unique properties make them promising candidates for future applications.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Their high efficiencies, along with their relatively low cost, make them the most valuable solution nowadays. However, it is well known that silicon solar cells are extremely sensitive to temperature, and that they can lose up to 15 \u2013 20% of their room temperature efficiency under normal operating conditions [1,2]. Wide-gap solar cells have been proposed as valuable alternative solutions, because to their smaller temperature sensitivity [3]. However, the room temperature efficiencies of these candidate materials are still lower than silicon-based devices, making them not competitive enough. The reasons for these lower performances is a smaller readiness level of the materials and of the devices based on wide-gap absorbers [4]. A suitable option to enhance the competitiveness of wide-gap solar cells more rapidly is to implement heat recovery strategies. It is well know that for single-junction solar cells the efficiency are limited by the so-called Shockley-Quisser limit [5], and that most of the losses in solar cells (up to 90%) are in the form of heat [6\u201310]. Among all the suitable options in order to enhance PV efficiencies by heat recovery, the hybridization with thermoelectric generators (TEGs), has gained an increasing attention in recent years. In Hybrid Thermoelectric-Photovoltaic (HTEPV) systems, the TEG part can recover the solar cell heat to produce an additional power output and enhance the overall device output power and efficiency. HTEPV devices have been the object of many studies and reviews, especially in the last years [11\u201313]. Within this literature the opinion on the actual effectiveness of HTEPV devices has been quite fluctuating. Actually along the years these systems have been reported as both very convenient [14\u201317] and not suitable to increase PV efficiency [18,19]. In the last couple of years most of the works published on HTEPV systems have been dedicated to the study of their transient behavior over time [20\u201322], to the effect of the TEG geometrical parameters [23,24], and to hybrids with perovskites solar cells [25,26]. In particular for perovskites, Zhou et al. [25] reported a surprising 4.9% efficiency gain for a CH3NH3Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 solar cell with optimized energy gap, coupled with a commercial TEG. Strangely enough the authors report a \u0394T over the TEG sides of only 7.7\u00a0\u00b0C corresponding to the mentioned efficiency gain, making the interpretation of this result quite difficult. A possible explanation can be related to the different renormalization of the power densities over the respective areas of the two parts of the hybrid device. Fu et al. [26] reported instead the hybridization of a large area perovskite solar module with a customized TEG based on bismuth telluride. In this case, the authors showed a more sensible 1% efficiency gain reaching a total hybrid efficiency of 12.7%. The work is particularly interesting for the study of the electrical hybridization of the two system parts, and for the analysis of the efficiency stability over time. These preliminary results on the thermoelectric hybridization with perovskite solar cells, call for further analysis of the potential of HTEPV systems with this kind of material, and in general with wide-gap solar cells. This is the approach we follow in this work. In fact here we present a theoretical and experimental study on HTEPV systems based on wide-gap solar cells. Based on a detailed characterization of three kinds of wide-gap cells, namely amorphous silicon (aSi), Gallium Indium Phosphide (GaInP) and Perovskites solar cells, we exploited a theoretical model to predict the hybrid system behavior versus temperature. The model results were then used to choose the best PV material for the thermoelectric hybridization (namely the perovskite solar cell), and to define the TEG design. An optimized bismuth telluride TEG was then developed and characterized on the basis of previous studies on pure Solar Thermoelectric Generators (STEGs) [27\u201329]. Finally, the HTEPV devices were built and characterized as a function of temperature, optical concentration, ambient pressure, and cold side cooling. This experimental evaluation validated the theoretical model used in this work and demonstrated the actual potential of HTEPV system based on wide-gap solar cells. Our approach is novel in many respects. First of all, in this work a home-made TEG is developed to reach thermal matching conditions making the system work at the optimal temperature. In fact, very rarely commercial TEGs have a thermal resistance suitable for solar cells hybridization, as pointed out in our previous work [30]. The optimized layout was found based on a deep characterization of the solar cell to be hybridized. Furthermore, we focused our efforts on a very specific target, namely the demonstration of an effective HTEPV operating at low optical concentrations and low temperatures. To this purpose only wide-gap solar cells are suitable because they are less sensitive to temperature. In this perspective, this work not only confutes the thesis that only high optical concentrations are suitable for HTEPV systems [18], but also identifies a class of already existing implementable materials. Finally, the study on the effect of the vacuum level and of the cold side temperature add a perspective on the applicability of this kind of HTEPV systems in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the main objective of this work is the development and the characterization of a HTEPV prototype optimized to work at low optical concentration, demonstrating efficiency gains compared to the sole PV case. The methodology adopted starts from a deep characterization of the solar cell to be implemented, and the use of a theoretical model to predict the optimized hybrid design. Based on this model a home-made TEG, based on Bi2Te3, is constructed and paired with the solar cells for characterization.  The hybrid system developed in this work consists of an optimized TEG placed in thermal contact with the back of a wide-gap solar cells, as depicted in Fig. 1 . In this kind of devices the solar cell absorbs sunlight and produces an electrical power which is collected at its front and back contacts. Most of the not converted power becomes heat within the solar cell and increases its temperature. The. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "TEG (in this case composed by only one couple made of a p-type and a n-type leg) absorbs part of this heat and produces and additional electrical power by means of the Seebeck effect. This kind of thermally coupled generators should not be confused with another class of HTEPV systems, normally referred as optically coupled devices [31,32]. In that case the TEG and PV parts are in fact separated, and a spectrum splitting technology is implemented to direct different parts of the solar spectrum towards them. In a previous study we showed how the optically coupled approach is less convenient than the thermally coupled one [33]. When the TEG is not in thermal contact with the solar cell, it can only access the infrared (IR) part of the solar spectrum, without being able to recover heat losses of the PV part. Most of the heat losses are in fact happening in the UV\u2013Vis section of the spectrum where the solar cells absorb [9]. In other words, it is more convenient, in terms of final efficiency gains, to keep the solar cell at the same temperature of the TEG hot side, instead of keeping the cell cold but loosing much of the recoverable heat. For this reason, the temperature sensitivity of the PV part is a key parameter, and the kind of solar cells to be hybridized must be chosen carefully. Temperature sensitive materials, such as silicon, loose too much efficiency to make the hybridization convenient. On the other hand, wide-gap solar cells are less temperature sensitive so that their thermoelectric hybridization might be convenient, as shown in our previous work [34]. The physical reason behind this behavior relies on the fact that temperature sensitivity depends on the electron-hole recombination rate. The wider the energy gap, the smaller the recombination rate, and consequently the temperature sensitivity. For a detailed discussion on this matter the reader may refer to [35]. Another consideration deals with the electrical connection between the PV and TEG parts. The case in which the two components are electrically separated is the simpler. For this kind of systems the thermal flux flowing through the device is the main parameter on which designing the HTEPV components. For the case of electrical hybridization, instead, also the internal resistance of the PV and TEG parts must be considered, and a current matching optimization must be considered. Several works have been devoted to electrically hybridized systems with the conclusion that in general it is possible to match the two components without having additional losses [16,36]. In this perspective, the case in which the PV and TEG parts are separated is a simplification of the fully hybridized case and it is the one implemented in this paper. Summarizing, in this work we developed a thermally coupled, electrically separated, HTEPV device based on wide-gap solar cells. The working mechanism can be outlined as follows. The solar cell absorbs sunlight and converts it into electrical power. The unconverted part mostly becomes heat in the cell. Part of this heat then flows through the TEG, which is placed in thermal contact with the cell back at its hot plate and is cooled down by a fluid dissipater at its cold plate. The TEG converts part of the heat flowing through it into an additional electrical output. The dimensions of the TEG legs are designed to increase as much as possible the overall efficiency of the system. Finally, the hybrid device is placed into an evacuated tube, in order to minimize the heat exchange with the environment. For such kind of systems the hybrid efficiency can be written as \u03b7htepv=\u03b7pv+\u03b7teg\u03b7ot where \u03b7pv and \u03b7teg are respectively the temperature dependent PV and TEG efficiencies, and \u03b7ot the so-called opto-thermal efficiency. The PV efficiency is normally reported to have a linear decrease as a function of temperature [37]. In this work \u03b7pv is determined by a detailed characterization of the wide-gap solar cells chosen. The TEG efficiency (\u03b7teg) is instead calculated on the material thermoelectric properties as follows [38] \u03b7teg=Th-TcTh1+ZpnTm-11+ZpnTm+TcTh with Th and Tc respectively the hot and cold temperatures of the TEG, Tm=Th+Tc2, and Zpn the thermoelectric figure of merit defined as Zpn=\u03b1p-\u03b1n2\u03bap\u03c1p+\u03ban\u03c1n2 where \u03b1, \u03c1, and \u03ba are the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical resistivity, and the thermal conductivity of the p and n thermoelectric materials. In this work the TEG was developed starting from commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) wafers, and the thermoelectric properties were given by the producer. Once the TEG was built its electrical properties were then characterized and compared with the producer\u2019s data. The opto-thermal component \u03b7otof Eq. (1) is instead the efficiency with which the HTEPV system converts the incoming power into heat flowing through the thermoelectric part. Actually, not all the solar power is converted into heat flowing through the TEG, as some of it is reflected by the solar cell top surface, and part of the heat generated within the solar cell is lost towards the environment. In the present work we consider placing the HTEPV device encapsulated within an evacuated environment. Thus, only radiative losses have to be taken into account. In this perspective the opto-thermal efficiency can be written as [39] \u03b7ot=1-\u03b7pv1-Rpv\u03c4enc-QradPin with Rpv and \u03c4enc respectively the solar cell optical reflectance and the encapsulation optical transmittance, and with Pin and Qrad respectively the solar input power and the sum of all the radiative heat losses. In Eq. (4) the product of the terms in the square brackets is the efficiency with which the solar cell converts the input solar power into heat. We assume therefore that all the power not becoming electrical output within the solar cell, excluding optical losses (namely Rpv and \u03c4enc) becomes heat. This assumption is justified on the basis of estimations of heat losses available in solar cells [9]. The input power can be written instead as Pin=\u03b3optGAabs where \u03b3opt, G, and Aabs are respectively the optical concentration, the input solar power density, and the solar cell active area. Heat losses (Qrad) account for radiative losses. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "between the solar cell top surface and the environment, and between the TEG hot and cold sides. Following the model of our previous study [39], it can be shown that Qrad=2\u03b5eff\u03c3AabsTh4-Tc4 where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and \u03b5eff is an effective emittance accounting for both sources of radiative loss. Eq. (6) is a simplification that can be made by taking some assumptions. Actually, the radiative losses from the PV top surface should be written as Qradpv=\u03b5pv\u03c3AabsTpv4-Ta4 where \u03b5pv is the top surface solar cell emittance, Tpv the PV temperature, and Ta the environment temperature; while the radiative loss across the TEG is Qradteg=\u03b5teg\u03c3Ateg-AteTh4-Tc4 where Ateg is TEG area, Ate is the area occupied by thermoelectric legs, and \u03b5teg is the effective TEG emittance accounting for radiative exchange from the hot to the cold plates, and from the cold to the hot plates of the TEG. It can be shown that [40] \u03b5teg=11\u03b5h+1\u03b5c-1 with \u03b5h and \u03b5c respectively the emittances of the hot and cold TEG plates. Eqs. (7) and (8) can be joined to give Eq. (6), if the PV and TEG parts have the same areas (Aabs\u00a0=\u00a0Ateg) the total TEG area is much bigger than the area occupied by thermoelectric legs (Ateg\u226bAte) the PV have the same temperature of the TEG hot side (Tpv=Th) the TEG cold side is at room temperature (Tc=Ta) If all these assumptions are satisfied, it follows that Aabs = Ateg =Ateg-Ate, and Tpv4-Ta4 = Th4-Tc4, and Eqs. (7) and (8) can be joined. In the present work all the above assumptions are taken, since they are well satisfied by the experimental setting and the system characteristics. Therefore, in the present case the effective device emittance is simply the average of the TEG and PV emittances \u03b5eff=\u03b5pv+\u03b5teg2 and radiative losses are calculated by Eq. (6). It also useful to introduce the so-called TEG filling factor as FF=AteAteg Note that assumption 2 implies that the TEG filling factor is small. In view of assumption 1, it follows then that FF=AteAabs. In Fig. 2 the typical behaviors of \u03b7htepv, \u03b7pv,\u03b7teg, and \u03b7ot as a function of Th are reported. It can be seen in the graph that while the PV and opto-thermal efficiencies decrease versus temperature, the TEG efficiency increases. This sets an optimal temperature of operation for the HTEPV system (Topt). This is a key point for the engineering of the device. Actually, once the PV efficiency versus temperature and its optical characteristics (Rpv, and \u03b5pv) are determined by characterization, and once also the TEG material properties versus temperature are defined, it is possible to predict the behavior of \u03b7htepv as a function of Th and determine Topt. Based on the optimal working temperature the TEG leg sizes can be computed. In fact, the heat flowing through the TEG can be written as Qte=\u03b1p-\u03b1nThI+Th-TcRpth+Rnth-I2Rpel+Rnel2 withI the TEG electrical current, Rpth and Rnth the p and n thermoelectric materials thermal resistances, and Rpel and Rnel the p and n thermoelectric materials electrical resistances. The first, second, and third addend of Eq. (11) are respectively the Peltier heat, the conduction heat (Fourier\u2019s law), and Joule\u2019s heat. The TEG leg sizes are represented into Eq. (11) by the following relationships: Rpth=Lp\u03bapAp,Rnth=Ln\u03banAn Rpel=\u03c1pLpAp,Rnth=\u03c1nLnAn where Lp, Ln, and Ap, An are respectively the p and n leg lengths, and cross-sectional areas. For the sake of simplicity in this work we will consider a TEG generator composed by only one p-n couple of thermoelectric materials, with the same lengths (namely Lp = Ln= L). It follows that Ate=Ap+An. Since the opto-thermal efficiency defines the efficiency with which the HTEPV system converts the incoming power into heat flowing through the TEG it follows that Qte con be also be written as Qte=Pin\u03b7ot Therefore, once Topt is defined, it is possible to compute\u03b7ot from Eq. (4), and then calculate the optimal leg dimensions using Eqs. (11), (12), (13), and (14) in order to keep the system working at optimal temperature. In the calculation it has to be taken into account that when the p and n legs have the same thickness an optimal ratio between the n and p leg areas exists, and it is equal to \u03b3npopt=AnAp=\u03c1n\u03bap\u03c1p\u03ban Eq. (15) is valid not only for the HTEPV case, but it is a general argument firstly proposed by Ioffe [41] applicable to TEG generators when operating between two heat sinks. Finally, it is useful to define the efficiency gain, hereafter named Energetic Convenience Index (EnCI), due to thermoelectric hybridization as EnCI=\u03b7htepv-\u03b7pv0 where \u03b7pv0 is the PV efficiency at room temperature. Thus, EnCI enables a quantitative comparison between HTEPV systems and the best PV scenario, namely cooled solar cells. In summary, we firstly carried out a detailed characterization of three kind of wide-gap solar cells, in order to determine their efficiency dependence over temperature and their optical characteristics (Rpv, and \u03b5pv). Then the results of this characterization are inputted along with the thermoelectric material properties in Eq. (1) in order to calculate the HTEPV efficiency behavior versus temperature and to find the optimal working temperature Topt. Then using Eq. (14) the heat flowing through the TEG at Topt is calculated and using Eqs. (11), (12), (13), and (15), the thermoelectric leg areas An and Ap are found for a given value of the leg thickness L. Finally using Eq. (10) the value of FF can be determined.  In this work the solar cells chosen to be hybridized are based on aSi, InGaP, and Perovskite. aSi and InGaP solar cells were acquired respectively from the Italian National Energy Agency (ENEA) [42] and from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [43]. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a direct (n-i-p) mesoporous structure, were instead developed at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. The structure of mesoporous PSCs used in this work is displayed in Fig. 3 (a). A compact-TiO2, acting as a blocking layer for hole injection into the FTO electrode was deposited via spray pyrolysis on a glass/FTO (Fluorinated Tin Oxide). The mesoporous-TiO2 layer, deposited via. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "spin coating and sintered at 480\u00a0\u00b0C, acts instead as scaffold layer for the perovskite growth. Both the compact-TiO2 and the mesoporous TiO2 form the Electron Transport Layer (ETL). A triple cation perovskite (Cs0.05FA0.8MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) absorber, with an energy gap around 1.65\u00a0eV (see extrapolation of this value in the supplementary information and similar results in [44]) was deposited via spin coating over the mesoporous-TiO2 layer, using Chlorobenzene as antisolvent, with one step deposition technique [45]. Right after its deposition, perovskite was annealed at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, and a SpiroMeOTAD Hole Transport Material (HTM) was deposited via spin coating over it. Then, an Au back electrode was deposited by thermal deposition (i.e. vacuum evaporation at 10-6 bar). In this work, the glass substrate was 25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0mm2 and the FTO was etched (1\u00a0mm in width, see right) by means of a Nd:YVO4, \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01064\u00a0nm raster scanning laser, in order to separate the anode and the cathode. The active area for the measurements of electrical parameters (PCE, JSC, FF and VOC) was 1\u00a0cm2. To protect the PSC from degradation due to oxygen and moisture [46], an encapsulation strategy similar to that reported by Matteocci et al. [47] has been used. As reported in the previous section, the characterization needed to predict the HTEPV performances consists in the measurement of solar cells reflectance, emittances, and temperature sensitivity. Solar cell UV\u2013vis reflectance was characterized between 250 and 2500\u00a0nm with a Jasco 570 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Emittance was instead estimated by infrared reflectance as \u03b5T=\u222bBB\u03bb,T1-R\u03bb-\u03c4\u03bbd\u03bb\u222bBB(\u03bb,T)d\u03bb with BB\u03bb,T the calculated spectral power density of a black body at given temperature T and wavelength \u03bb, while \u03c4(\u03bb) and R(\u03bb) the measured transmittance and reflectance at the given wavelength. It has to be noted that for all the solar cells considered in this work \u03c4\u03bb=0, since UV\u2013Vis and IR transmittances were found to be null. Furthermore, in Eq. (17), R depends only on \u03bb since the reflectance was taken at room temperature. Thus, in this evaluation we assumed a temperature independent reflectance. Fig. 4 shows emittance values for the three solar cells considered. Infrared reflectance was taken between 400 and 4000\u00a0cm\u22121 with a Thermo Fisher FTIR 6700 equipped with an integrating sphere. Regarding current\u2013voltage (J-V) characteristics of solar cells and of the hybrid device, the characterization was performed in a vacuum chamber equipped with a window and placed under an ABA, ABET Technologies solar simulator. For the solar cells, they were attached with thermally conductive paste on a controllable heather, and their temperature monitored with K type thermocouples and a Keithley 2700 multimeter. J-V curves were recorded between 25 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C with steps of ~10\u00a0\u00b0C by a Keithley 2440 source meter controlled with a LabView program. Only for the case of perovskites, forward, reverse, and stabilized I-V curves have been recorded, since considerable differences were found among the three cases (details in SI). The characterization was performed for all three cells between 1 and 5 Suns to determine the effect of optical concentration on the temperature sensitivity. The solar simulator incoming power was always measured and adjusted with a certified refence silicon solar cell, and a 1\u00a0cm2 stainless-steel mask was implemented to accurately evaluate the incoming power density. The results of the temperature sensitivity characterization performed on the solar cells at 1 sun are reported in Fig. 5 . As the graph displays, while GaInP shows the expected linear decrease versus temperature, both aSi and perovskites exhibit a nonlinear behavior. Especially for the latter the efficiency shows an interesting increase, reaching a maximum in the temperature range 45 \u2013 55\u00a0\u00b0C, followed by a strong decrease. This behavior is consistent with what reported in literature [48], and coherent with a tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition reported for MAPI perovskites [49\u201351]. Also regarding the cases of aSi [52] and GaInP [43], results are in line with literature data. For perovskites, Fig. 5 reports only the case of stabilized efficiencies, which are more reliable than the reverse and forward sweeps [53]. A detailed summary of the characterization on the perovskite and the other solar cells implemented in this work are reported in the Supplementary Information (SI). Finally, the temperature sensitivity of the three solar cells were fitted by polynomials (full lines in Fig. 5). The HTEPV system developed in this work is intended for low optical concentration levels. The reasons for this choice are several. First, low concentration implies optimal operation temperature typically under 400\u00a0K. Limited working temperatures are beneficial in terms of materials stability (especially for the solar cell), allow the use of only one thermoelectric material for the TEG part (avoiding the difficulties related to stacked or segmented TEGs), and keep the system in a temperature regime where other hybrid PV/thermal technologies are difficult to be implemented. Secondly, at low concentration levels the system is more scalable, with limited occupational areas for the optics, with in addition the interesting possibility to avoid daily tracking (e.g. using Compound Parabolic Concentrators - CPCs). Finally, also regarding the dissipation at the TEG cold side, small concentration implies small heat flux to be dissipated and thus simplifying the system. For temperatures between 300 and 400\u00a0K the most efficient and reliable thermoelectric material is bismuth telluride. For this reason, wafers of both p and n type Bi2Te3, 1\u00a0mm thick, coated with titanium were acquired. Producer\u2019s data regarding the wafers thermoelectric properties are reported in the SI. Fig. 6 summarizes the results of the model based on the PV characterization described in the previous section. The graphs compare the efficiencies of the PV (dashed lines) and the HTEPV (full lines) as a function of temperature and optical concentration for the three PV materials considered in this paper. As anticipated, for all three cases, thermoelectric hybridization leads to efficiencies higher than the efficiency of the sole PV case at room temperature. These gains show partially similar trends among materials. In all cases, the higher the optical concentration, the higher the gain. This behavior is due to a double beneficial effect of concentration, which on one hand increases the PV efficiency and mitigates. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the PV temperature sensitivity, and on the other hand reduces the effect of radiative thermal losses. The first effect is due to a higher carrier generation/recombination ratio, which increases the PV efficiency and decreases its temperature sensitivity. The second effect is instead due to a higher opto-thermal efficiency. In fact, the increase of optical concentration increases the value of Pin in Eq. (4), leaving instead Qrad unaltered. For the cases of GaInP and aSi the optimal temperature increases with the concentration. This implies that also the optimal TEG device (and thus the optimized output power) changes with the irradiation level. At concentration 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0the optical temperature falls in the range 370 \u2013 400\u00a0K. For perovskite, instead, the optimal temperature is stable around 340 \u2013 350\u00a0K and is independent of the optical concentration. The main reason for this dissimilarity is given by the strong decrease of the perovskite PV efficiency for temperature higher than 340\u00a0K. Fig. 6 summarizes all efficiency gains (EnCI, as defined by Eq. (16)). In addition, for the case of perovskite, a further gain, defined as the difference between the maximum HTEPV efficiency and the maximum PV efficiency is reported, since in this case the PV efficiency at room temperature is not the PV best case scenario. Table 1 clearly shows how perovskite gives the highest values of EnCI at all optical concentrations. This evidence, is further strengthened by an analysis of the economic viability of PSC-TE solar harvesters. As extensively discussed in a previous publication [54], hybridization of perovskite solar cells with TEGs at the current technology stage (ZT \u2248 1) displays remarkable margins of profitability for domestic solar harvesting (rooftop solar panels). In short, we could show how, differently from what happens with more standard PV technologies (e.g. polycrystalline silicon), the additional capital cost of a TEG stage is largely overcompensated by the extra amount of electric power, both in non-concentrated cells and for typical concentrations (5 suns) achievable with low-cost optical systems such as compound parabolic collectors. This, joined with the fact that perovskite has the higher final efficiency (as shown in Fig. 6) led to the choice of this material for the practical demonstration of solar cell hybridization. As mentioned above, in this work the hybrid system was implemented and fully validated for the case of perovskite. There are multiple reasons for this choice. Firstly, perovskite leads to the highest values of EnCI and of the final efficiency. Secondly, the model predicts an optimal temperature around 340\u00a0K. This temperature is well within the range of temperatures normally experienced by solar panels and does not imply the need of difficult thermal management strategies. Thus, in this case the HTEPV device is directly comparable and compatible with actual solar cells. In addition the fact that the optimal temperature is essentially insensible to the variation of the irradiation level, also implies that the optimized TEG design is independent of this parameter. This is a very important evidence supporting the choice of perovskite solar cells, as it implies that the hybrid device will always work near its optimal temperature, independently of the change of the irradiation level over the day. Using the model described in Sect. 2 the TEG filling factor and consequently the p and n leg areas were calculated. Table 2 reports the values of the filling factor for optical concentrations of 1, 2 and 5. As shown, filling factors are very small, justifying assumption 2 made in Sect. 2. Based on the model results, Bi2Te3 wafers were then cut and soldered on copper plates (additional details in SI). Finally, the TEGs so obtained were characterized, measuring their internal resistance and their thermoelectric voltage. Fig. 7 left reports the I-V curve for the determination of the TEG internal resistance, while Fig. 7 right shows its thermoelectric response. For the sake of clarity Fig. 7 reports only the case of the TEG optimized to work at no optical concentration. The characterization performed showed that while Seebeck voltages were consistent with manufacturer\u2019s specifications, TEG internal resistance is slightly higher than the calculated value (0.018\u00a0\u03a9 for the case reported in Fig. 7 left). This suboptimal result is presumably due to the existence of a contact resistance at the leg/plate interface, which in turn leads to a final HTEPV output power smaller than its calculated value. Once the TEG was characterized, the perovskite solar cell was thermally coupled to the TEG hot plate to form the HTEPV device. In particular, the TEG cold side was attached with thermal grease to the vacuum chamber bottom and its temperature controlled with a K type thermocouple. The chamber bottom temperature was controlled with a dissipation liquid circuit, fed with a chiller with adjustable temperature. In case of active cooling the temperature of the base was always kept at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. This simulates a stable ambient temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C, in the approximation that the water temperature equals that of the environment. In the real case scenario, however, the temperature of water fluctuates over time, moving the TEG cold temperature and in turns its output power. The solar cell was placed in thermal contact to the TEG top electrode by means of a layer of thermal grease. The grease was used to allow good thermal contact between the two components but also to allow the insertion of a thermocouple to measure the temperature at TEG/solar cell interface. Also in this case, J-V curves were recorded by a Keithley 2440 source meter controlled with a LabView program. The results reported in what follows were tested to be reproducible over several trials. Error bars shows the standard deviation of these measures. Fig. 8(a)reports the influence of the active cooling on the build-up of a temperature difference at the TEG sides, in the case of no optical concentration. As expected, active cooling facilitates a more rapid increase of \u0394T over time and allows to reach a higher final temperature (333.53\u00a0K). This temperature is anyway slightly lower than the optimal temperature predicted by the model (334.64\u00a0K). The reason behind this discrepancy. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "is probably due to the non-optimal thermal contact between the solar cell and the TEG hot plate. Actually, the model does not account for the thermal resistances of the alumina plate at the solar cell bottom and the thermal grease. Luckily, the predicted HTEPV efficiency (showed in Fig. 6) presents a region around the optimal temperature where the efficiency does not change significantly. This is a further strong point of HTEPV device based on perovskites. From Fig. 8 (a) it might also seem that the passive and active cooling cases are not very different. However it should be considered that for the case of passive cooling the bottom of the vacuum chamber (consisting in a metallic plate with a large heat capacity due to its volume) acted as heat sink. Fig. 8(b) reports instead the dependency of maximum \u0394T versus the chamber pressure. It shows that the maximum \u0394T is optimal for a range of pressure between 10-5 and 10-3 mBar but drops significantly for higher pressures. At ambient pressure the maximum \u0394T is nearly half of that at 10-5 mBar. Consequently, in this case the TEG contribution is a quarter of that at best case. Finally, the output power of the TEG coupled with the perovskite solar cell under illumination at max \u0394T was measured by a J-V characteristic. In Fig. 9 left the JV curve (black line) along with the power output, hereafter Pteg (blue line) are reported. As expected the J-V characteristic is linear with an open circuit voltage (Voc) equal to the product between the TEG Seebeck coefficient and \u0394T. Regarding the output power, the maximum TEG power, hereafter Ptegmax (which is the minimum of the blue line in Fig. 9(a), since by convention the output power of a power generator is negative) occurs at a Voc/2 corresponding to a load resistance equal to the TEG internal resistance. From the ratio Ptegmax/Pin it is then possible to calculate the TEG efficiency and consequently the value of the hybrid efficiency (\u03b7htepv) and of EnCI. Fig. 9(b) reports these results for three different value of optical concentrations compared with the model predictions, showing that the measured values of \u03b7htepv and EnCI follow quite accurately the predicted trend, although computations slightly overestimated them. This difference probably originates from a small mismatch of the TEG internal resistance, due to non-optimal electrical contacts between the legs and the copper plates. Nevertheless, the comparison between the experimental characterization and the calculated data shows that our model is accurate.  In this work we demonstrated that the thermoelectric hybridization of wide-gap solar cells can lead to final efficiencies higher than the sole PV case. In particular the cases of aSi, GaInP and triple-cation perovskite were taken into account, and firstly analyzed in the framework of a computational model able to predict the final hybrid efficiency. The input data for the model were obtained by means of a detailed characterization of the given solar cells at different optical concentrations, predicting efficiency gains always positive, ranging between 0.2 and 3.1%. The case of perovskites was found of particular interest since showed efficiency gains higher than 2% at all the optical concentrations considered (1, 2, and 5) with maximum efficiency gains happening at moderate temperatures (around 340\u00a0K), nearly independent of the irradiation level. For these reasons and in view of the economic profitability of hybrid harvesters pairing TEGs and PSC cells, the case of perovskite was chosen for the development of a hybrid device prototype. To this purpose bismuth telluride wafers were acquired and cut in pieces accordingly to the sizes calculated with the model, able to make the system to work at optimal temperature. The thermoelectric legs were then soldered and the HTEPV system developed. The characterization of the system under solar illumination showed gains at optimal temperature very similar to those predicted, validating the model described and its results. The characterization also showed the influence of the pressure in which the system works, and the effect of active cooling at the TEG cold side. A final maximum efficiency gain of 3.05%, at temperatures normally experienced by solar cells, was thus experimentally demonstrated for the case of perovskite, showing the actual potential of hybrid thermoelectric \u2013 photovoltaic systems.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Photovoltaic technology is deemed one of the most promising technologies as a future resource. Thin-film solar cells on foreign substrates are considered as less expensive alternatives . Polycrystalline chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell is one of the most promising thin-film solar cells for low-cost production and high efficiency. The CIGS solar cells with conversion efficiencies of above 19.9% with small area and beyond 16.6% for sub-module have been reported . It is revealed that the double graded Ga profile in CIGS absorber material induces the double graded band-gap energy (E g) profile, thereby enhancing open-circuit voltage (V OC), short-circuit current density (J SC), and conversion efficiency (\u03b7) of CIGS solar cells . Therefore, the optimization of the Ga profile in CIGS to obtain suitable E g structure for the high efficiency has been considerably studied . It has been well known that CIGS with appropriate E g profile is achieved by 3-stage method, resulting in high cell performance . In this contribution, CIGS films are however fabricated by the so-called \u201cmulti-layer precursor method\u201d, employing multi-layer co-evaporation of material sources . The method offers fast fabrication process (low-cost production) by shortening the deposition time of the precursor layers. The CIGS crystallization and Ga profiles in the resulting films are primarily manipulated by the annealing process and controlled thicknesses of CIGS precursor layers. In addition, CIGS films on flexible stainless steel (SUS) substrates are prepared, since it can be applied to the roll-to-roll process, with the ability to reduce production cost. The V OC of the CIGS solar cell is considered as one of the most important parameters for the improvement of cell efficiency. The V OC is well known to be correlated to the carrier concentration in the CIGS absorber, CIGS crystal quality, and local E g near the CIGS surface . Under the so-called \u201cmulti-layer precursor method\u201d, the carrier concentration and crystal grain size in CIGS absorbers are manipulated by crystal orientation, while the local E g near the CIGS surface is controlled by local Ga content near the CIGS surface. CIGS films with the different crystal orientations and Ga profiles are thus prepared. The crystal orientation is primarily controlled by the deposition temperature of CIGS precursors, whereas the Ga profile, usually expressed in the term of Ga/(In + Ga), Ga/III, profile, is regulated by the Ga flux rate during the CIGS deposition. The examination concentrates on the impacts of the crystal orientation and averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface on the performance of CIGS solar cells, especially V OC.  CIGS films with numerous Ga/III profiles were deposited on two substrate structures. The structure of flexible SUS substrate is SUS/Fe diffusion barrier layer (BL)/Molybdenum (Mo), and that of rigid soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate is SLG/Mo. After the preparation of the SUS and SLG substrates, CIGS films were grown by the process named \u201cmulti-layer precursor method\u201d . In the method, Ga-Se/In-Se/Cu-Se precursors were prepared at substrate temperatures of approximately 320\u2013460 \u00b0C (Low T SUB), and subsequently annealed in Se flux at substrate temperatures of about 510\u2013550 \u00b0C (High T SUB) for the formation of the copper-rich CIGS film with Cu/(In + Ga) of around 1.1. The substrate temperature was monitored by the pyrometer during the film fabrication. The sample was next evaporated by In, Ga, and Se at the same temperature to obtain the slightly copper-poor CIGS film with Cu/(In + Ga) of approximately 0.80, and cooled in Se flux down to the temperature of below 430 \u00b0C. In the deposition process, the CIGS crystallization was principally manipulated by annealing temperature (High T SUB). The crystal orientation of resulting CIGS films was primarily controlled by the deposition temperature of CIGS precursor layers (Low T SUB), while the Ga/III profiles were regulated by the Ga flux rate observed by a beam throughout the CIGS. The beam flux monitor is a system containing a movable ion gauge unit for local pressure measurement, namely the material fluxes. In the case of CIGS films on SUS substrates, the sodium (Na) was introduced into the films under the same condition for the improvement of cell performance . The final material compositions, which were measured by energy dispersive spectroscopy operated at 20 kV, are Cu/(In + Ga) of about 0.80, Ga/III of 0.28\u20130.46, and Se/Metal of 1.00. The Ga/III profiles were investigated by dynamic-secondary ion mass spectroscopy (D-SIMS). Averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface was calculated from the Ga/III profile within a range of 200 nm from the CIGS surface, while averaged Na was estimated from Na profile, observed by D-SIMS, throughout CIGS film. Equivalent E g in the resulting CIGS film was estimated by the actual Ga/III ratio using an equation E g (x) [eV] = 1.044 + 0.735x \u2212 0.223x(1 \u2212 x), where variable x denotes the content ratio of Ga/III, in the case of Cu/(In + Ga) of 0.9 , which is almost similar to Cu/(In + Ga) of about 0.80 in our CIGS films. CIGS films were additionally examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystallographic structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.5405 \u01fa) radiation operated at 45 kV and 40 mA. I(220/204)/I(112) ratio was defined as the ratio of integrated intensities of (220/204) to (112) planes in the CIGS film. In this work, the (112)-oriented CIGS absorber was considered as the CIGS film with I(220/204)/I(112) ratio of below 1, whereas the (220/204)-oriented CIGS absorber was one with I(220/204)/I(112) ratio of above 1. CIGS films were moreover investigated using time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) with laser power and wavelength of 1 mW and 532 nm, respectively (Hamamatsu C12132). Estimated penetration depth of the laser with a wavelength of 532 nm into the CIGS of a top is about 100 nm. The carrier lifetime (\u03c4) in the resulting films was calculated from the fitting of their TRPL decay curve by using I(t) = A1 exp(\u2212t/\u03c4 1) + A2 exp(\u2212t/\u03c4 2),. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "where t is the time after a laser pulse excitation, I(t) is the luminescence intensity at time (t), and A1 and A2 are the coefficients. The \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 are the fast and slow components of the TRPL lifetimes, respectively. The slow component (\u03c4 2) was used as the bulk carrier lifetime within a range of about 100 nm from the CIGS surface. The CIGS absorber was furthermore examined by the optical deep level transient spectroscopy (ODLTS), providing the energy position of the defect state in its E g . CIGS solar cells on both flexible SUS and rigid SLG substrates were fabricated with the total cell area of 0.14 cm2, including active material, busbars, and fingers. A structure of the CIGS solar cell on flexible SUS substrate is SUS/BL/Mo/CIGS/Cadmium Sulfide (CdS)/Zinc oxide (ZnO)/In2O3:Sn (ITO)/NiCr-Al grid, whereas that of the CIGS solar cell on rigid SLG substrate is SLG/Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO/ITO/NiCr-Al grid. After depositing the CIGS film, a CdS buffer layer was prepared by chemical bath deposition. ZnO as a window layer and ITO as a transparent conductive oxide layer were deposited by sputtering. After the formation of top NiCr-Al grid, the cell parameters (J SC, V OC, fill factor (FF), and \u03b7) were evaluated from the current density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristic based on the total cell area of 0.14 cm2 under Air Mass 1.5G illumination (100 mW/cm2). The carrier concentration in the CIGS absorber of the solar cell was measured by capacitance\u2013voltage measurement.  In this section, we report on (220/204)-oriented CIGS films on flexible SUS substrates prepared by the so-called \u201cmulti-layer precursor method\u201d under a Low T SUB of 320 \u00b0C for I(220/204)/I(112) ratios in a range of approximately 2.2\u20132.4. A number of Ga/III profiles for various averaged Ga/IIIs near the CIGS surfaces are obtained by the manipulation of Ga flux during the CIGS deposition. It was reported in our previous work that V OC is very much influenced by the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface . Therefore, Fig. 1 exhibits V OC of the solar cells on SUS substrates, where their absorbers possess the (220/204)-preferred orientations with I(220/204)/I(112)s of about 2.2\u20132.4, as a function of the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface. It is revealed that the increase in the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface gives rise to the increase in V OC, attributable to the local enhancement of the averaged E g near the CIGS surface. When the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface is above 0.44, V OC is deviated from that acquired by extrapolation from the averaged Ga/III of below 0.44, as shown in a dashed line with its slope of \u0394V OC/\u0394E g = 1. This implies poorer electronic properties of CIGS films near the surfaces, well consistent with the decrease in the \u03c4 2, when the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface increases, as demonstrated in the inset graph in Fig. 1. The deterioration of CIGS quality near the surface due to the increasing averaged Ga/III could be explained by ODLTS measurement. According to the ODLTS result, there is a dominant defect level in E g of CIGS films by the multi-layer precursor method, which is situated at about 0.80 eV from the valence band edge. This defect level moves closer to the middle region of E g, acting as the recombination center, when the E g, depending on the averaged Ga/III, increases, also observed by another group . It is consequently stated that the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface plays a role in determining V OC. Moreover, the V OC could be approximately predicted without cell fabrication, when the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface is known as long as the preferred crystal orientation is almost similar. The different crystal orientations are principally controlled by Low T SUB, varying from 320 to 460 \u00b0C, whereas the Ga/III profiles are manipulated by Ga flux rate during the film deposition. Fig. 2 demonstrates (a) XRD spectra, and (b) different Ga/III profiles of CIGS absorbers on SUS substrates with I(220/204)/I(112) ratios of 1.72 for (A), 1.16 for (B), and 0.79 for (C). In Fig. 2(a), the preferred crystal orientation of resulting CIGS is changed from (220/204) to (112) with the increase in the Low T SUBs from 360 to 420 \u00b0C. It is found that the Low T SUB in a range of 320\u2013400 \u00b0C leads to the formation of (220/204)-oriented CIGS with I(220/204)/I(112) of above 1, while that of above 400 \u00b0C results in the fabrication of (112)-oriented CIGS with I(220/204)/I(112) of below 1 under the multi-layer precursor method. Fig. 3 shows photo-J\u2013V characteristics of CIGS solar cells on SUS substrates, where XRD patterns and Ga/III profiles of their absorbers correspond to those in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. In Fig. 2(b), the minimum Ga/III point for (A) is the lowest (the lowest E g point), thus enhancing the light absorption in the longer wavelength region. Moreover, the most graded Ga/III at the back region (0.7\u20131.6 \u03bcm from the CIGS surface) in the case of (A), improving the back surface field, helps in the collection of carriers generated outside the space charge region. Consequently, the J SC of 28.50 mA/cm2 in the case of A is the highest in Fig. 3. However, the V OC decreases from 0.616 to 0.548 V, when the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface increases from 0.38 (A) to 0.44 (C) in Fig. 2(b). This is because the I(220/204)/I(112) is changed from 1.72 (A) to 0.79 (C) in Fig. 2(a), thus reducing carrier concentration in CIGS absorbers owing to the decrease in the averaged Na, as demonstrated in Fig. 5, which will be discussed. The result suggests that the crystal orientations of CIGS absorbers have impacts on their carrier concentration and averaged Na, which affects V OC . Fig. 4 displays cross-sectional and surface images of CIGS absorbers on SUS substrates with different I(220/204)/I(112) ratios. The I(220/204)/I(112) ratios of CIGS absorbers from 0.75 to 2.27 are manipulated by the Low T SUB, decreased from 460 to. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "320 \u00b0C with a constant High T SUB of 510 \u00b0C for the CIGS crystallization. It is exhibited that the grain size of CIGS films is decreased with increasing I(220/204)/I(112) from 0.75 to 2.27, although the High T SUB is the same. Fig. 5 depicts (a) averaged Na and (b) carrier concentration in the CIGS absorbers on SUS substrates as a function of the I(220/204)/I(112) ratio. In Fig. 5(a), the averaged Na increases from 5.3 \u00d7 1018 to 7.9 \u00d7 1018 atoms/cm3 with I(220/204)/I(112) from 0.75 to 2.27, because of the decrease in CIGS grain size, as seen in Fig. 4. This suggests that Na in CIGS films is normally located at the grain boundary. In Fig. 5(b), the carrier concentration increases, when the I(220/204)/I(112) ratio increases to 1.72 due to the increase in the averaged Na to 7.1 \u00d7 1018 atoms/cm3, but decreases, when the ratio is above 1.72 owing to the excess averaged Na of above 7.1 \u00d7 1018 atoms/cm3. The influence of Na in CuInSe2 structure was theoretically reported by Wei et al. that the Na with small concentration replaces InCu antisite defects, thus increasing carrier concentration . Then, as the Na concentration increases to the level that most of the InCu defects have already been replaced, it starts to remove the acceptor (Cu vacancy), thereby decreasing the carrier concentration . Consequently, according to Fig. 5, Na first eliminates InCu antisite defects and/or GaCu antisite defects in CIGS structures, thus enhancing the carrier concentration, when the averaged Na is increased from 5.3 \u00d7 1018 to 7.1 \u00d7 1018 atoms/cm3 in case of the CIGS film prepared by multi-layer precursor method. On the other hand, when the averaged Na is more than 7.1 \u00d7 1018 atoms/cm3, it starts to remove the acceptor (Cu vacancy), thus reducing the carrier concentration at the I(220/204)/I(112) ratio of above 1.72, as depicted in Fig. 5(b). Thus, the optimal I(220/204)/I(112) ratio of the CIGS film prepared by the multi-layer precursor method is approximately 1.7, giving rise to the highest carrier concentration for high V OC of the device. It was reported by Chaisitsak et al. that (220/204)-oriented CIGS absorbers with I(220/204)/I(112) of about 1.8 prepared by the 3-stage growth process allow more Cd atoms to diffuse into absorber surfaces to form a favorable p/n homojunction; however, a decrease in V OC can be observed for I(220/204)/I(112) of above 1.8, resulting from the excess Cd-doping . In Fig. 5(c) under the multi-layer precursor method, it is demonstrated that the V OC enhances to a maximum value at the I(220/204)/I(112) of 1.72, attributed to the increase in the carrier concentration and/or the improvement of p/n homojunction quality (more Cd diffusing into absorbers). In contrast, the V OC decreases at I(220/204)/I(112) of above 1.72, attributable to the decrease in the carrier concentration, too small CIGS size, and/or the excess Cd-doping into the CIGS surface. Subsequently, the crystal orientation in the CIGS absorbers has a strong influence on cell performance, especially V OC. Fig. 6 illustrates the V OC of the solar cells on SLG substrates as a function of the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface with the different I(220/204)/I(112) ratios. The numbers in the graph denote the I(220/204)/I(112) ratio. The I(220/204)/I(112) of (220/204)-oriented CIGS absorbers is in a range of 1.4\u20131.7, and that of (112)-oriented CIGS absorbers is in a region of 0.1\u20130.7. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the V OC increases and more enhances with the (220/204)-oriented CIGS absorbers, when the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface increases. The results indicate that the V OC of the devices is drastically influenced by not only the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface but also the crystal orientation in the CIGS absorbers. On the basis of the orientation in the absorber, the CIGS film on flexible SUS substrate with the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface of 0.38 and optimal I(220/204)/I(112) of 1.72 is fabricated. As a consequence, the cell parameters (J SC = 30.42 mA/cm2, V OC = 0.62 V, FF = 76.05%, and \u03b7 = 14.44%) are obtained without anti-reflective layer, as illustrated in Fig. 7 , where the absorber is prepared by the so called \u201cmulti-layer precursor method\u201d. In addition, the V OC of 0.62 V in Fig. 7 is roughly the same as the predicted V OC of about 0.61 V at the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface of 0.38 in (220/204)-oriented CIGS in Fig. 6. Ultimately, the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface could be used approximately as an indicator of V OC without cell fabrication as long as the preferred crystal orientation in absorber is almost similar.  In this contribution, CIGS films with several Ga/III profiles and different crystal orientations are deposited by the process named \u201cmulti-layer precursor method\u201d. It is disclosed that the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface, controlled by Ga flux rate, plays a part in determining the V OC. It could be utilized as a predictor of V OC before cell fabrication. In addition, the (220/204)-preferred orientation in the CIGS, deposited under Low T SUB in a range of 320\u2013400 \u00b0C, has a good impact on cell performance, especially V OC. This is because the (220/204)-oriented CIGS absorber with the proper I(220/204)/I(112) of approximately 1.7 leads to the increase in the averaged Na to the optimal value of 7.1 \u00d7 1018 atoms/cm3 and/or the improvement of p/n homojunction quality. The conversion efficiency of the CIGS solar cell on flexible SUS substrate is finally improved, where the (220/204)-oriented CIGS absorber with the averaged Ga/III near the CIGS surface of 0.38 and the appropriate I(220/204)/I(112) of about 1.7 is fabricated by the multi-layer precursor method.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Metal\u2013air batteries and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been proven to be the promising candidates as the class of energy conversion devices to provide clean and sustainable power, and oxygen electrocatalysis plays a critical role in the next-generation devices []. Moreover, the promising clean energy technologies of rechargeable metal-air batteries and regenerative fuel cells require the electrocatalysts with high voltage outputs and low over-potentials for ORR and OER [,]. Generally, the electrocatalysts (such as Pt-based materials) are favorable for ORR usually tends to be poor for OER and vice versa []. Therefore, it is a great challenge to develop the multifunctional electrocatalytic materials to drive both ORR and OER with high activity and low cost for the practical applications of clean energy technologies. Among various metal elements, Pd has been considered as a promising candidate to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts for their similar crystal structure and lattice constant []. Great efforts have been made on modification of the electronic structure of Pd to enhance the catalytic activity by controlling their morphologies [], alloying Pd with foreign metals [], or supporting Pd on metallic oxide []. Libuda et al. reported that for the catalyst of Pd supporting on Fe3O4, a thin PdOx layer at the particle/support interface can be formed when initial oxidation of the metal atoms. This strong interaction can modify the electronic structure of Pd and enhance the catalytic activity []. Recently, Co3O4 as one of the most popular spinel type metal oxide, are the great investigated in the literature due to their rich redox chemistry, high electrocatalytic activity and lower cost []. Meanwhile, the cobalt ions existing in mixed valences make them easily act as donor-acceptor chemisorption sites for the reversible adsorption of oxygen in the electrooxidation reaction []. It is well-known that MHNPs joined together through metal-oxide interfaces can facilitate synergistic interaction and show preferable catalytic activity and stability []. Drawing inspiration from outstanding electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4 and Pd, PdO-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles with well-defined structure might ensure an excellent electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a highly active multifunctional catalyst heterostructure PdO-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles with closely mutually connected interfaces were synthesized by air-oxidation treatment the PdCo nanoparticles. The PdCo nanoparticles were obtained according to our previous work []. The activity and durability toward ORR and OER of the PdO-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles were evaluated, and the mechanisms behind its excellent performance were elucidated.  Brie\ufb02y, 1.65\u2009mmol EDTA (0.1\u2009M) aqueous solution was mixed with 0.2\u2009mmol H2PdCl4 (0.05\u2009M) solution and 1.45\u2009mmol Co(NO3)2 (0.1\u2009M) solution. Then the resulting mixture solution was quickly injected into 8.2\u2009mmol NaBH4 (0.1\u2009M) aqueous solution with vigorous stirring in an ice water bath. The resultant black powder was collected by centrifugation, washed with deionized water three times, and dried overnight at 70\u2009\u00b0C. The precursor was formed and denoted as PdCo. The catalyst was prepared by annealing the precursor powder at 300\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h in air at a heating rate of 2\u2009\u00b0C/min and denoted as PdCo-300. Pd-300 and Co-300 were also synthesized via similar procedure. The precursor PdCo annealed at different temperatures (200\u2009\u00b0C, 400\u2009\u00b0C and 500\u2009\u00b0C) for 2\u2009h were also carried out and denoted as PdCo-200, PdCo-400 and PdCo-500, respectively. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV-185, Rigaku) with filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The morphology of the samples was measured by JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded by VG ESCALAB 210 instrument equipped with Mg K\u03b1 radiation. The whole electrochemical experiments were measured with a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instruments Corp, Shanghai, China). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were measured with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) controller (AFMSRCE, Pine Instrument Co.) connected to a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. A three-electrode system was applied, with Hg/HgO electrode and Pt wire as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The catalyst \ufb01lm-coated glassy carbon working electrode are prepared as follow: (i) 3\u2009mg of the electrocatalyst and 7\u2009mg of Vulcan XC-72 were dispersed into 1\u2009mL ethanol containing 50\u2009\u03bcL 5\u2009wt.% Nafion solution by sonication for 30\u2009min to form a homogeneous ink. (ii) 6\u2009\u03bcL of the ink was coated on the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 4\u2009mm in diameter), resulting in a catalyst loading of 0.455\u2009mg\u2009cm\u22122. Commercial 20\u2009wt.% Pt/C (Johnson Matthey) was used for comparison with the same powder loading.  The morphologies of the prepared samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PdCo (Figure S1) is present in a structure of mutually connected and fused irregular nanoparticles with clear edges. After the calcination treatments, the PdCo-300 (Figs. 1 (a) and S2) nanoparticles exhibits more obscure boundaries. The irregular particles (darker contrast) can be seen surrounded by cloudy domain nanostructures (lighter contrast). The structure is expected to be the PdO domain surrounded by the Co3O4 domain, where the different contrasts in the transmitted electron intensities are due to their different mass to charge ratios []. Meanwhile, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image further confirmed that the PdO domain was nested in the Co3O4 domain. As shown in Fig. 1(b\u2013d), The darker, smaller nanoparticles were identified as PdO on the basis of a distinct PdO (101) lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.265\u2009nm. At around Pd nanoparticles, the lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.243\u2009nm is ascribed to the (311) plane of Co3O4, and the lattice spacing of 0.286\u2009nm conforms to the (220) plane of spinel Co3O4. At the boundary of PdO domains, some of Co3O4 seems to be amorphous because there was no clear lattice fringe observed in the HR-TEM image (Fig. 1(b\u2013d)). The numerous amorphous regions imply that the PdCo-300 has a very poor crystallinity, which further confirmed by our following XRD analysis result []. The particles were found to be lattice-to-lattice coupled (Fig. 1(d),(e)), although the heteroparticles had di\ufb00 ;erent dspacing orientations. Furthermore, a strained and defect-rich interface (Fig. 1(f)) was observed at the PdO. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "and Co3O4 adjacent domain. These defects could tune the corresponding electronic redistribution for electrocatalysis and improve their electrocatalytic performance []. Fig. 1(g) shows a representative HADDF-STEM image of PdCo-300. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping analysis in Fig. 1(h\u2013j) show that the elements Co, O and Pd are all presented in the PdCo-300. As shown in Fig. 1(i), Pd is homogeneously distributed in the bright region NPs in the HAADF image (Fig. 1(h)). In contrast, Co is mostly distributed in the boundary of Pd areas although its presence is strongly noted inside the Pd areas. These results demonstrate that Co3O4 nanoparticles are doped with PdO and the sample is presented in a structure with PdO surrounded by the Co3O4 domain. XRD spectra of samples are shown in Fig. 2 (a). For Pd-300, the peaks located at 33.8\u00b0, 41.9\u00b0, 54.7\u00b0, 60.2\u00b0 and 71.5\u00b0 are attributed to the (101), (110), (112), (103) and (211) planes of PdO (PDF# 41-1107). For Co-300, the two weak and broad peaks at about 36.9\u00b0 and 65.4\u00b0 are corresponded to the (311) and (440) facets of Co3O4 (PDF# 74-1657). As for the precursor of PdCo, the three broad peaks at 40.1\u00b0, 46.7\u00b0 and 68.1\u00b0 are attributed to metal Pd (111), (200) and (220), respectively (PDF# 46-1043). After calcination, the precursor of PdCo is transformed to PdCo-300, the peaks of PdO and Co3O4 can be observed for the PdCo-300. There was no diffraction peak of component Co observed in the precursor of PdCo, while two weak and broad peaks of Co3O4 can be observed in the PdCo-300, indicating the component Co do exists in the as-synthesized catalysts and are reduced in size with a poorly polycrystalline structure [,]. To further increase the annealing temperature, the Co3O4 XRD peaks intensity of PdCo-400 and PdCo-500 (Figure S3) became stronger and sharper, indicating that the higher temperature leads to better crystalline degree of \ufb01nal products []. It is worth noting that there was no diffraction peak of PdO observed in the PdCo-200 (Figure S3), while the peaks of Co3O4 can be observed, confirming Co is more easily oxidized than Pd. Meanwhile, compared to Pd-300, the peaks of metal Pd disappeared with the addition of Co in the PdCo-300, which may be attributed to the introduction of cobalt species can promotes the oxidation of palladium. The oxidation states and surface composition of the prepared samples were characterized by XPS. As presented in Fig. 2(b), two main peaks can be seen at about 780.0 and 795.2\u2009eV, corresponding to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 spin-orbit peaks of Co3O4 []. In addition, two peaks exhibited at about 787.1 and 803.7\u2009eV correspond to the shake-up satellite peaks of Co3O4 []. Importantly, the binding energy of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 shifts to a higher value by 0.9\u2009eV and 1.4\u2009eV and the satellites are strengthen in PdCo-300, indicting more Co2+ component present in PdCo-300 []. The main peak can be \ufb01tted by two regions of Co2+ and Co3+, and the Co2+/Co3+ ratios of PdCo-300 (1.5) is higher than that of Co-300 (1.1), indicating that a partial Co3+ ions are turn into Co2+ with the presence of Pd species during heat-treating process. According to the electroneutrality principle, an increase in the Co2+ content means a rise in the amount of oxygen vacancies [], that is, surface oxygen vacancies are more easily formed on the surface of PdCo-300 nanoparticles, which can be further con\ufb01rmed by high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the peaks at 529.8, 531.1, 532 and 533.8\u2009eV can be ascribed to lattice oxygen (O2\u2212), peroxide (O-), superoxide (O2 -) and hydroxyl (OH-), respectively []. Compared with Co-300, the major peak of Co 2p and O 1s of PdCo-300 shifting in the direction of high binding energy, which can be attributed to the di\ufb00 ;erent combination manner of O2- bonded with Co3+ and Co2+ on the surface of PdCo-300 nanoparticles []. Besides, the peaks of O- and O2 - species of PdCo-300 nanoparticles are obviously strengthened, which can be ascribed to more easily formed oxygen vacancies in PdCo-300. According to early studies, oxygen vacancies not only can activate adsorb oxygen and provide the lattice sites of oxygen migration, resulting in the formation of highly active electrophilic oxygen species, but also can generate new defective states in the energy band gap of Co3O4 and two electrons on the defective states are easily excited, leading to enhancement of the electronic conductivity of Co3O4 [,]. Fig. 2(d) shows the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the Pd-300 and PdCo-300, the peaks at 335.5 and 340.8\u2009eV are ascribed to Pd-0, the peaks of at 337.2 and 342.6\u2009eV are attributed to Pd2+, the peaks at 337.6 and 342.6\u2009eV are considered Pd4+, and the peaks at higher bonding energy (339.7 and 345.3\u2009eV) are considered to Pd-O junction or PdOx [,]. It is noted that the metal Pd still presents in the Pd-300 even though annealing in the air for 2\u2009h, while no peaks of metal Pd can be observed in the PdCo-300, which is further confirmed that the cobalt can promote the oxidation of palladium. Compared to Pd-300, the binding energy of Pd 3d for PdCo-300 shifted more positively. The positive shift could result in a decrease of the d-band center in Pd, leading to a decrease of the surface coverage by the generated OH, and releasing more active sites on the Pd surface for O2 adsorption, and thus enhancing the electrocatalytic activity []. Based on the XRD, TEM, and XPS analysis, we can give a reasonable description about the structure of PdCo-300. During the air-oxidation treatment of PdCo, Co is first converted to CoO. In this process, the diffusion of oxygen atoms is faster than cobalt atoms. Then, CoO is further oxidized to form Co3O4. The transition from CoO to Co3O4 is di\ufb00 ;erent from that of Co to CoO, the Co di\ufb00 ;usion is more rapid than the O di\ufb00 ;usion, resulting in Pd species were nested in the cobalt oxide phase after the oxidation treatment [].. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "The formation of this structure is considered to be the Kirkendall-based mechanism []. Pd is transformed to PdO along with the rise of oxidation temperature and the prolongation of oxidation time. At the interface, a few Co ions enter the lattice of the PdO, which contributes to the higher Co2+/Co3+ ratios in PdCo-300. The exchange of Co and Pd species at the interface can be described as a reaction of Pd2+ + Co3+ \u2192 Pd\u03b4 + + Co2+ during heat-treating process [,]. The oxide film can be grown either at the metal-oxide interface (in which case the transport of oxygen ions inside the nanoparticles prevails) or at the gas-solid interface (and then the transport of metal to the surface is dominating) []. In the case of a difference in diffusion coef\ufb01cients, accumulation of vacancies at the metal oxide interface can lead to the formation of MHNPs with intimate connected boundary domains. Apparently, these closely mutually connected interfaces will result in the surface reconstruction around the interface, lattice mismatch and electron interaction/transfer across the interface, and lead to produce more catalytic active sites. Based on the DFT calculation, we investigated the oxidation state of the Pd atom (see SI for detailed description about our DFT calculations). The calculated Bader charge of Pd atom in the PdO (P42/mmc) and PdO2 (P42/mnm) crystal are 0.96e and 1.62e respectively (Figure S7). The charge of a Pd atom at the 4-fold coordination site in the Co3O4 cell (F-43\u2009m) is 1.12e, while that of a Pd occupies a 6-fold coordination site achieves 1.69e (Figure S8), which is larger than that of Pd4+ ion in PdO2. In the poorly polycrystalline structure Co3O4, with the more complex coordination, Pd atom maybe achieve higher oxidation state []. The samples with different annealing temperature for ORR and OER were shown in Figure S5 and Figure S6, respectively. We can see that the PdCo-300 displays the best catalytic activities than those of PdCo-200, PdCo-400 and PdCo-500. Therefore, we choose 300\u2009\u00b0C as PdCo annealing temperature. The electrocatalytic performances of PdCo-300 and commercial Pt/C were first investigated by CV technique. As shown in Figure S4, there is an obvious reduction peak at about 0.7\u20130.8\u2009V for all samples in O2-saturated environment but no peak appears in N2-saturated solution, suggesting all samples have catalytic activity for ORR. The ORR peak potential for PdCo-300 is about 0.81\u2009V, which is more positive than those of Pd-300 (0.78\u2009V), Co-300 (0.71\u2009V) and PdCo (0.77\u2009V), indicating PdCo-300 has better ORR catalytic performance. To further compare the ORR activity, the LSV tests were carried out with a sweep rate of 10\u2009mVs\u22121 at a rotation rate of 1600\u2009rpm by RDE in O2-saturated 0.1\u2009M KOH solution. For comparison, the commercial Pt/C, Pd-300, Co-300 and PdCo were also tested at the same condition. As is shown in Fig. 3 (a), the PdCo-300 displays the better ORR activity with the current density of -5.07\u2009mA cm-2 and the half-wave potential of 0.83\u2009V, which is very close to those of commercial Pt/C (-5.1\u2009mA cm-2, 0.85\u2009V), and higher than those of Pd-300, Co-300 and PdCo catalysts. Noticeably, Co-300 and Pd-300 display relatively lower ORR activity compered to PdCo-300, suggesting a synergic e\ufb00 ;ect between PdO and Co3O4. The polarization curves for ORR of PdCo-300 at rotation rates varying from 400\u2009rpm to 1600\u2009rpm are shown in Fig. 3(b), and the Fig. 3(c) shows the Koutecky-Levich plots. These plots were linear, indicating the first-order kinetics with respect to oxygen. The average transfer electron number was calculated to be 3.85 from 0.4 to 0.8\u2009V (vs. RHE), suggesting a four-electron reaction for PdCo-300. Additionally, the PdCo-300 electrocatalyst exhibited an excellent stability with only 6% decrease in current after the test for 10,000\u2009s (Fig. 3(d)), which is signi\ufb01cantly superior to that of the commercial Pt/C (34% current decrease after the test for 10,000\u2009s). The catalytic activity of as-synthesized samples for OER were also investigated (Fig. 4 (a)). It can be seen that PdCo-300 has a more negative OER onset potential than those of other samples. The potential required to oxidize water at the current density of 10\u2009mA cm\u22122 is a metric related to solar fuel synthesis []. Compared to Co-300, Pd-300 and PdCo, PdCo-300 shows a highest electrocatalytic activity for the OER with a potential of 1.58\u2009V at a current density of 10\u2009mA cm\u22122, 60\u2009mV negative than that of commercial RuO2 (1.64\u2009V). The multifunctional electrocatalytic activity was usually evaluated by the variance metrics \u0394E (Ej =10 mA cm \u22122 \u2013 Ej =-3 mA cm \u22122). A smaller \u0394E indicates the better eletrocatalytic activity and more promising for practical use in fuel cells. As shown in Table S1, the PdCo-300 exhibited a superior bifunctional eletrocatalytic activity with a smaller \u0394E of 0.76\u2009V than that of Pt/C (0.96\u2009V) and most of the reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Further durability measurements with a chronoamperometer for 10,000\u2009s are presented in Fig. 4(b). After 10,000\u2009s of continuous OER at 1.60\u2009V, PdCo-300 showed 20% attenuation relative to its initial current density, whereas for the commercial RuO2 and Pt/C, the attenuation was almost 38% and 50%, respectively. We take ORR as example to elucidate the effect of the coexisted Pd and Co ions in the interface of PdCo-300 based on the DFT calculations. Some investigators justified that DFT calculated barriers can be used to estimate the redox barrier [,]. Both XRD and TEM indicated that the PdO(101) surface was the main exposed surfaces. So, various of ORR mechanisms [] on the pure PdO(101) surface were explored with DFT calculations in our work. The detailed calculation model and method were described in the SI. Our calculations showed that the favorable mechanism for ORR on the PdO(101) surface involves five elementary steps as follows: O2g \u2192 O2ad O2ad + Had \u2192 OOHad OOHad \u2192 OHad + Oad Oad + H2Oad \u2192 OHad + OHad OHad + Had \u2192 H2Oad The transition state structure and the Gibbs free energy of activation (at 298.15\u2009K) for steps 1b to 1e were listed in Table S2. The OOHad formation step (1b) was found has the highest free energy. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of activation of 0.36\u2009eV. The transition state for this step was displayed in Fig. 5 a. On one type of Co-doped PdO(101) surface (see Fig. 5b), a new mechanism for the ORR with lower barrier was found. This new mechanism involves following six elementary steps: O2g \u2192 O2ad O2ad + H2Oad \u2192 OOHad + OHad_Co OOHad \u2192 OHad_Co + Oad Oad + H2Oad \u2192 OHad_Co + OHad_Pd OHad_Co \u2192 OHad_Pd OHad_Pd + Had \u2192 H2Oad We also listed the transition state structure and Gibbs free energy of activation for steps 2b to 2e in Table S3. The last step 2f is similar to the step 1e on the pure PdO surface. On the Co-doped surface, the OH* transferring step from Co to Pd atom is found as the rate-determining step (2e), which has the highest Gibbs free energy of activation of 0.19\u2009eV. The energy profile for this step were presented in Fig. 5b. The energy barrier of the rate-determining on Co-doped PdO surface is obviously lower than that on pure PdO surface. On the Co-doped Pd (101) surface, there is nearly no barrier for the OOHad formation step (2b). The free energy of activation for the O O bond breaking step on Co-doped surface (2c, 0.12\u2009eV) is also substantially lower than that on pure PdO (101) surface (step 1c, 0.33\u2009eV). The stronger interaction between OH, H2O and Co is very important to reduce the energy barrier of ORR. The synergy between Pd and Co clearly facilitates the ORR. The enhanced electrocatalytic activities mainly be attributed to the following factors: (i) The structure of PdCo-300, in which the PdO and Co3O4 present in PdO-Co3O4 mixed phase boosts the electrocatalytic activity. Speci\ufb01cally, the PdO domain was surrounded by the Co3O4 domain, which produced closely mutually connected interfaces. At the interface, the exchange of Co and Pd species can result in a valence states transformation of Pd and Co (Pd2+ + Co3+ \u2192 Pd\u03b4 + + Co2+). The existence of high valence state Pd\u03b4 + with a downshift of the d-band center could decrease the super\ufb01cial coverage by the generated OH, leading to the release of more active sites for O2 adsorption, and thus improving the ORR activity. Meanwhile, Co3+ partially reduced to Co2+ in the Co3O4, producing a large number of oxygen vacancies. these oxygen vacancies may improve the electronic conductivity, facilitate the OH\u2212 adsorption, provide more electrochemically active sites, and thus enhance the electrocatalytic activity for OER. (ii) The synergistic e\ufb00 ;ect between the Co and Pd ions in the interface, which have different adsorption energy to intermediate species, and change the reaction to a path with small barrier.  In summary, we have successfully synthesized the PdO-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles with closely mutually connected interfaces. The PdCo-300 exhibits an excellent eletrocatalytic performance for ORR in alkaline electrolyte with the current density of \u22125.07\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 and the half-wave potential of 0.83\u2009V, which is very close to those of commercial Pt/C (-5.1\u2009mAcm\u22122, 0.85\u2009V), a higher electrocatalytic activity for the OER with a potential of 1.58\u2009V at a current density of 10\u2009mA cm\u22122, 60\u2009mV negative than that of commercial RuO2 (1.64\u2009V). Meanwhile, the PdCo-300 nanoparticles also exhibit excellent durability during long-term cycling in the alkaline environment due to excellent stability of the special heterostructure. Moreover, the PdCo-300 nanoparticles are prepared by a facile procedure, which can be easily extended to the preparation of other multifunctional material for a broad range of applications such as solar cells, fuel cells and other heterogeneous catalysis.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apenergy.2019.114429.txt", "paper": ["In the United States, the residential and commercial building sectors account for 39% of the total U.S. energy consumption [1]. Since fossil fuels are used to produce around 50% of electricity production [2], buildings are responsible for a considerable amount of greenhouse gas emissions. One solution to reduce the energy consumption from the electricity grid is to use building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) that provide electricity during the day when demand is at its peak. Roof-mounted BIPV accounts for 80% of the market and includes shingles, slates, tiles, or cladding. Organic semiconductors can be synthesized to selectively harvest a particular range of the solar spectrum, therefore allowing the fabrication of colored or transparent solar modules. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are made by combining a donor and an acceptor material. The donor material can either be a polymer deposited using solution processing or small molecules deposited using evaporation. Common acceptor materials are fullerenes or fullerenes derivates such as C60, C70, and C60-PCBM. Transparent solar modules can be added to the window area and increase the total available surface to produce electricity [3]. Previous work by our group has shown the potential for highly transparent photovoltaics (PV) for window applications due to their high average visible transmission [4]. Transparent photovoltaics (TPV) produce electricity by converting the near-infrared portion of the spectrum into electricity. Converting near-infrared, or heat into electricity, also changes the energy demand of the building. In the US, electricity consumption is higher during the summer due to cooling and ventilation, while natural gas is mostly used during the winter for heating [5]. During warmer months, the TPV reduces the amount of heat that reaches the inside of the building, therefore reducing the cooling energy demand. For colder months, the benefits of TPV could vary. TPV can help conserve the heat inside the building by reflecting the indoor radiant heat. However, since it also reduces the solar heat from the exterior, depending on the location and building design, it could either reduce or increase the heating demand. However, well-designed TPV is likely to reduce both the electricity and natural gas consumption since they have similar spectral properties as low emissivity coating technologies, which are deposited on the window to preserve heat loss [6]. The combined benefit of electricity production and change in energy demand for a building with TPV has not been evaluated. Transparent photovoltaic modules are not possible with traditional semiconductor materials, but semi-transparent modules are. The energy saving and electricity production were evaluated for amorphous silicon [7], and organic [8] semi-transparent modules. Their use was found to reduce the cooling energy demand in warm climate but increase the heating demand in cold climate. However, for all studies except the organic solar module, the window properties in the building energy simulation were based on the UV\u2013vis spectrometer measurement, which is incorrect since the energy absorbed for a PV module is transformed into electricity, not heat. Therefore, the spectrum needs to be corrected to account for this difference. The spectrum was corrected in one organic semi-transparent organic PV study [8]. However, the visible transmittance was only 23%, which is much lower than the 70% achieved for the technology considered in this work. Since the authors did not provide details about the solar cell material, device structure, and optical properties, it is impossible to compare the performance of semi-transparent photovoltaics with TPV. The conventional approach to evaluate the benefit of PV in a building is to use building simulation such as EnergyPlus [9]. Only one study has used outdoor testing facility to validate the energy saving potential of semi-transparent silicon modules [10]. Previous studies have focussed on energy balance over one year, assuming that all properties would remain the same. The degradation of the PV module, the electricity production from the grid, and the price of electricity and natural gas over time were not considered. Most importantly, all previous studies focussed on semi-transparent rather than transparent technologies. This work is the first to estimate the potential energy saving and electricity production associated with the use of highly transparent photovoltaics that can be employed for window applications. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) can be used to evaluate the benefit of PV and TPV over its full lifetime and is used extensively to compare the environmental impact of photovoltaic technologies using the IEA LCA guidelines for PV [11]. We compiled a comprehensive literature review of OPV LCA studies that have been published since 2009 to ensure the novelty of this work, and the results are available in the supplementary material (SM) in Table S1. Out of the 27 papers published since 2009, only one considers small molecules donor materials [12], which is the type of material required for transparent photovoltaics. In addition to the limited number of materials that have been considered, 25 focus on power generation, and the studies that include building applications are for fa\u00e7ade integration [13] and window retrofit [14]. The window retrofit study is the same application as this work, but it is a company presentation with limited details on the modelling and assumptions, and the results have not been published in the scientific literature. The only LCA study of PV for window application we could find looks at adaptive shading made of CIGS module, which also reduces the cooling and heating energy demand [15]. The system was significantly different since it was made of multiple solar photovoltaic modules attached to a support structure placed on top of a window. Therefore, this work is the first life cycle assessment of transparent for OPV. In LCA, the functional unit refers to the unit of comparison where products perform similarly. Using the power generation from ground-mounted or rooftop application in LCA simplifies the analysis but also makes it possible to compare OPV with other types of photovoltaics that use Watt peak (Wp) as a functional unit. For new applications where OPVs provide additional synergistic functions beyond just electricity production, there is a need to redefine an adequate functional unit and a method to assess the potential of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "OPV beyond the traditional cost, efficiency, and lifetime approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of the net energy and net cost saving method enables us to account for the solar heat management as well as the electricity production of TPV. The net environmental benefit approach is popular in environmental engineering since it considers the no-action scenario as the baseline process [16,17]. In this work, we used the term net energy benefits rather than net environmental benefits since we limited the analysis to energy. For buildings, the no-action scenario corresponds to the energy consumption for a building. The net energy considers the energy invested in manufacturing the solar cell, the electricity production, and the change in energy consumption compared to the baseline building. The same approach can be used to quantify the net cost-benefit or the cost-saving of the technology. A lifecycle approach was used to evaluate the net benefit of transparent photovoltaics in window and skylight applications for various locations in the United States for either new or retrofit applications.  The overall approach to calculate the net energy balance, including the various modelling tools used for building energy consumption and electricity production, is summarized in Fig. 1 (a). The system boundary for the cradle to gate LCA of organic TPV is shown in Fig. 1(b). A clear double pane window was used for the baseline scenario for both the window and the skylight structure. The double pane window was assumed to have a 13\u00a0mm air gap between two sheets of 3\u00a0mm clear glass. Two types of organic TPV modules for window were considered and are shown in Fig. 1(c). In the first instance, the TPV material is evaporated on the interior surface of a new window glass pane (Glass-TPV). The second scenario is for retrofit of existing windows. The TPV module is encapsulated and attached using adhesive on the interior surface of an existing window (Plastic-TPV). The lifetime of the window and skylight was fixed at 20\u00a0years [18], and the Plastic-TPV was assumed to be replaced every 10\u00a0years. Two levels of technological maturity were considered. The best-case scenario corresponds to device expected performance in the near future with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% and 25\u00a0years lifetime (T50) [4,19,20]. The current case scenario corresponds to demonstrated lab-scale technology [21] with a PCE of 3% and a 7\u00a0year lifetime. The two limiting scenarios were used to evaluate the actual benefit of increasing efficiency and lifetime for transparent photovoltaics in building applications. The TPV materials, manufacturing process, and structure are illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The photovoltaic cell is made by successive deposition of chloroalumnium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc), a small molecule donor material, and C60 in between molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and bathocuproine (BCP) blocking layers. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a transparent conductive oxide which is used on both sides of the device and silver grid is deposited for contact. We note that TPV with PCE\u00a0>\u00a010% has been certified at the laboratory scale, and pilot-scale modules are being produced with PCE around 3% [22]. The maximum window size was limited to 2.1\u00a0m by 3.7\u00a0m based on the largest existing tempering oven in the US, which is required for the heat treatment of glass to be resistant to impact, wind load, and thermal stress breakage [23]. The silver grid and the outer busbars required for individual glass panels covered 11% of the area [24]. For Plastic-TPV, the active photovoltaic area was smaller due to the encapsulation, which requires a 5\u00a0cm wide edge around the perimeter [25]. We selected Detroit, MI, Los Angeles, CA, Phoenix, AZ, and Honolulu, HI since they have a diverse range of solar insolation conditions, climate zones, energy cost and energy impact of electricity production that influence the benefit of both solar photovoltaic energy production and building energy balance. Fig. 2 illustrates the various grid regions in the US-based on the Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGrid) sub-regions [26], climate zones, average annual solar insolation, and commercial energy prices. The climate zones were divided into subregions moist (A), dry (B), and marine (C) depending on the mean temperature and precipitation [27]. Table 1 provides details about the electricity regions, climate zones, average insolation, and energy prices for electricity and natural gas for each location. The photovoltaic electricity production was calculated using RETScreen 4 on a daily basis [31], and the building energy demand was simulated using EnergyPlus 8.7 on an hourly basis [9]. RETScreen is a Clean Energy Management Software for renewable energy and project feasibility analysis from the Government of Canada. The solar insolation and climatic database was developed by NASA and RETScreen and provide global data based from 6700 ground-based stations and NASA\u2019s satellite data [32]. The net energy balance was calculated for the 20\u00a0years and included a reduction in electricity production over time due to solar module degradation. The degradation was assumed to be linear from to original efficiency value and degrade to half of its original value over a given time corresponding to the T50 value. For example, for the future technology, where to \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a010% and T50\u00a0=\u00a025 yrs, the efficiency after 25\u00a0years would be 5%. We selected commercial buildings since they have large window areas that maximize the TPV module size. Also, commercial buildings have high occupancy and high energy demand during the day when electricity production and change in building energy demand occur for TPV. The building energy demand simulation used the default values for the building internal loading [33] of the post-1980 construction DOE reference building [34]. The building geometry was modified using SkechUp Pro 2017 to increase the window to wall ratio or skylight to roof ratio (see Table 2 ). The thermal characteristics of the building envelop are available in Table S2. The medium office building model was used for the window application and the small office building for the skylight application. The reference for the mid-size office building was modified to increase the window to wall ratio from 33.0 to 67.8%. The small-size office for skylight application was. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "also modified to incorporate a skylight onto the south roof, as shown in Table 2. All buildings were assumed to have a south azimuth orientation. The electricity production from TPV installation on the south, east, and east (SEW) sides of the building was compared to having modules on all sides, including the north side (SEWN). For the skylight, the tilt angle was fixed by the roof angle to 21\u00b0, and the azimuth was south. The default value for heating source in the reference DOE building was modified for each location based on the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) [5] and is summarized in Table S3 for all cities. The climate data and the building operation schedule were imported from the EnergyPlus database [35]. For the building energy simulation, the optical properties of the TPV module are required to calculate the solar heat gain of the building through the window. The UV\u2013Vis absorption was measured from the front and back side using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV\u2013Vis spectrometer. The resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b)). Fig. 3 highlights the ultraviolet (<435\u00a0nm), visible, and near-infrared (>670\u00a0nm) regions of the solar spectrum compared to the organic TPV. Fig. 3(c) illustrates the solar spectrum reflectance, transmittance, and conversion, as well as the back reflectance from the radiant heat. The front and back side spectra (Fig. 3(a) and (b)) are not the same, and in particular, the absorbance is more important on the back side, which contributes to heat conservation. EnergyPlus does not account for electricity production from the TPV, and therefore the near-infrared radiations are considered absorbed by the building rather than converted to electricity, which causes an overestimation of the solar heat gain and cooling energy demand. The UV\u2013Vis spectrum can be adjusted to consider the portion of the spectrum that is converted to electricity, as reflected rather than absorbed by the building [8]. The spectrum of converted electricity corresponds to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. Fig. 3(a) shows the front illumination original spectra front transmittance (Tf), reflectance (Rf), and absorbance (Af) of the ClAlPc:C60 TPV. The corrected absorption Af* was calculated using Eq. (1) and the EQE of the TPV (Fig. 3(d)). Since the sum of the transmittance, absorbance, and reflectance is 1, and the transmittance remains constant, the corrected reflectance Rf* can be calculated using Eq. (2). The spectra correction was only applied for the front illumination spectra since the electricity production from indoor illumination was not considered in this work. The spectrum correction was performed on the current ClAlPc:C60 technology and therefore a more significant reduction in heat absorption can be expected for future technologies due to a higher external quantum efficiency in the same region of the spectrum. However, the EQE of future technology was not estimated. This is because the EQE, which corresponds to the amount of light that is absorbed and efficiently converted to electricity, is difficult to predict since it is a combination of materials, device structure and fabrication. Af\u2217(\u03bb)=Af(\u03bb)-EQE(\u03bb) Rf\u2217(\u03bb)=1-Tf(\u03bb)-Af\u2217(\u03bb) The overall scope of the LCA is illustrated in Fig. 2(a) and excluded the end-of-life stage due to the lack of knowledge about potential end-of-life management options. The functional unit was the operation of one building for 20\u00a0years. The life cycle inventory used previously published data for material production, module fabrication [12,36], and direct measurement during device fabrication in the lab. TPVs were fabricated using previously reported device structure [37]. For large-scale applications, devices require busbar and silver grid, which cover approximately 11% of the total area [24]. Material consumption was calculated based on the measured material thickness and material density from the literature using a 30% material deposition efficiency [12]. The direct energy consumption during device fabrication was recorded using a Fluke 345 clamp meter. Module manufacturing was assumed to take place in the US. The impact categorie was cumulative energy demand (CED) based on the Cumulative Energy Demand Method v1.09 in SimaPro8 [38]. The LCA included the change in electricity generation over time for each region. The carbon footprint for the electricity grid over time was calculated using the TRACI 2.1 method [39]. Additional information on the lifecycle inventory input for the OPV manufacturing and the energy production is available in Tables S12 to S13 of the SI. The net energy benefit (NEB) is the difference in energy balance between the building with and without TPV. It is calculated using Eq. (1). It includes the impact of electricity generation from the TPV (PVgen), the cradle to gate life-cycle manufacturing of TPV (PVCED), as well as the change in electricity or natural gas consumption from the building. Our NEB analysis was limited to cumulative energy demand (CED). This is because the greenhouse gas impact associated with TPV manufacturing cannot be adequately estimated when using of fullerene as the acceptor material and other fine chemicals with missing inventory information [36]. To convert the direct energy to primary energy, we used the conversion efficiency value for either natural gas (\u03b7NG) or electricity (\u03b7Grid). The average US grid efficiency was used for the life-cycle manufacturing of TPV while the regional data was employed for the energy building. The grid efficiency at each location changed over time (\u03b7Grid X) due to the changing energy source in the US electricity grid (Table S14 and Fig. S3). The NEB was calculated using the annual PV generation (EaPVgen), avoided electricity consumption (\u0394EaElec), and natural gas (\u0394EaNG) to account for degradation and changing grid efficiency over the 20\u00a0year lifetime of the study. NEBCED=-PVCED+\u2211EaPVgen\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394EaElec\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394EaNG\u03b7NG The most common metrics to compare energy technologies are the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), the energy return on investment (EROI), and the energy payback time (EPBT). The LCOE takes into account the systems energy conversion efficiency, lifetime, and cost, including construction, operation, and maintenance over its lifetime to calculate an electricity price in \u00a2/kWh that is often used to evaluate grid parity for new renewable technologies [40]. The LCOE approach does not capture many of the advantages of organic photovoltaics such. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "as flexibility, low weight, and selective spectrum absorption, which enables their adoption in new applications such as portable electronics, smart fabrics, and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) [41\u201347]. Alternatives methods, such as the EROI or EPBT, use a life cycle assessment approach. The energy payback time (EPBT) corresponds to the amount of time the solar panel needs to produce electricity to payback for the energy required for its production. The EPBT calculation from the IEA guidelines for PV [48] assumes a constant grid efficiency and annual electricity production, which simplify the calculation to Eq. (4). However, this equation is inaccurate since it does not consider the change in building energy consumption, the decreasing electricity generation with degradation, and the electricity grid efficiency change over time. EPBTyears=PVCEDEaAveragePVgen\u03b7GridAverage For this project, the EPBT was calculated by considering the change in electricity (\u00b1\u0394EaElec)and natural gas (\u00b1\u0394EaNG), the TPV degradation impact on the annual electricity generation (EaPVgen)and the changing grid efficiency (\u03b7GridX). The payback time was calculated using Eq. (5), where t corresponds to the payback time. PVCED=\u22111tEaPVgen\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u22111t\u0394EaElec\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u22111t\u0394EaNG\u03b7NG The methodology for EROI was recently reviewed by the IEA task 12 to provide guidelines specific to photovoltaic applications [49]. EROI is a standard method that provides information on the ratio of energy returned to society in the form of a useful energy carrier over the total energy required or \u201cinvested\u201d in finding, extracting, processing, and delivering the energy [50,51]. Energy systems should have an EROI higher than one, implying that the energy delivered is higher than the amount of energy required to manufacture the system. Studies that use a life cycle approach to include all energy changes are referred as second-order EROI [52]. It is an accepted method by the IEA [49], and it was used to evaluate non transparent PV [7,53,54] for BIPV. However, it considered only electricity consumption change, not natural gas, which is commonly used in the United States for heating. Both EROI and EPBT methods are recommended by the IEA LCA methodology and are geographically dependent [11]. In theory the EPBT can be calculated directly using the EROI value by dividing the lifetime of the system by the EROI. However, using this calculation method overestimates the EPBT because the solar module electricity production decreases over time. EROI=\u2211EaPVgen\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394EaElec\u03b7GridX\u00b1\u2211\u0394ENG\u03b7NGPVCED Because of the lack of information on the greenhouse gas generation during TPV manufacturing, the analysis considered the reduction in GHG due to photovoltaics generation (PVgen) and the change in building energy demand (\u00b1\u0394EaElectricity/NG). Similar to the NEB analysis, the analysis was performed on an annual basis to account for the degradation of TPV and changing carbon footprint of the grid. The annual increase in energy prices in the US for the next 20\u00a0years was calculated based on the EIA 2018 forecast [55] in 2017$ to account for inflation. It was calculated to be 0.22% per year for electricity and 1.01% per year for natural gas. The maximum module price was calculated based on the lifetime saving for each location and the net present value.  Fig. 4 combines the building energy demand and the electricity production from the TPV module with 10% power conversion efficiency for the four cities considered. For the window application, the two electricity generation curves correspond to whether all the windows are covered with TPV (SEWN) or only the south, east, and west-facing directions (SEW). The electricity production depends on the azimuth and tilt of the module. The tilt is fixed at 90\u00b0 for TPV in windows, which is not the optimal angle for the PV module at any location. The south direction of the building has the largest solar insolation. However, the northern side can also produce electricity since the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) used in the electricity production from photovoltaics considers not only the direct solar radiations but also the reflected and diffuse insolation [56]. The PV production from the window application results in an almost constant electricity production throughout the year, in all cases except Detroit. Solar modules are generally installed at a tilt angle that corresponds to their latitude to maximize electricity production. The tilt angle from the skylight was 21\u00b0, which is similar to the Honolulu latitude. We assumed that the PV electricity production only reduced the consumption of electricity and not natural gas. Therefore, there is a relatively good match between electricity production from TPV and electricity demand for all cities. The cumulative energy demand associated with the TPV manufacturing of a 1\u00a0m2 module on glass or plastics is shown in Fig. 5 . The area corresponds to the size of the module, not the active area of the solar module. This is because the window area is the same per building, but the active solar cell area change depending on the type of modules. Because of the additional substrate and encapsulation, the Plastic-TPV has a 6% higher CED than Glass-TPV. In single-junction small molecules solar cells, the ITO sputtering accounts for about 50% of the total CED, and the active layer deposition varies from 10 to 20% depending on the material combination [12]. For TPV, the direct energy during the active layer deposition was measured to be 39.8\u00a0MJ/m2, which is 73% higher than previously reported values [12] and can be explained by a different deposition system with pumps having higher energy consumption. Even with higher deposition energy than in previous studies, the CED varied from 3.1 to 10.3\u00a0MJ/Wp for Glass-TPV and 3.4\u201311.4\u00a0MJ/Wp for Plastic-TPV while considering current and future technology. Previous values for single-junction OPV ranged from 3.6 to 8.4\u00a0MJ/Wp [12,57], which is similar to the values calculated in this work. By comparison for inorganic modules, CdTe embodied energy varies from 5.9 to 7.8\u00a0MJ/Wp and monocrystalline Silicon from 18.5 to 29.4\u00a0MJ/Wp [58]. Additional comparisons are available in SM (Fig. S1). The annual change in building energy demand with TPV is summarized in Tables S4-S11 in the SM. The net energy benefit of TPV for glass and plastic solar cells is shown in Fig. 6 and is positive for all scenarios considered. The photovoltaics electricity. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "generation was based on the current (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a03%, T50\u00a0=\u00a07 yrs) and future (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a010% T50\u00a0=\u00a025 yrs) technologies. The manufacturing energy was found to be negligible compared to the energy saving over 20\u00a0years for all scenarios. In addition to electricity production, the TPV reduces the summer electricity consumption due to the reduction in the NIR radiations entering the building. At the same time, the TPV layer reduces the heat loss from the building, which is helpful during the colder periods and contributes to reducing the natural gas consumption in most scenarios except for the skylight application in Detroit. The electricity production difference between Plastic-TPV and Glass-TPV is 73% in the current scenario but around 8% for the future scenario. This difference highlights the benefit of replaceable solar modules over integrated modules until high modules lifetimes are achieved. In the current scenario, energy saving had the most benefit, but as efficiency and lifetime of PV device increase, PV electricity production will become more important than energy saving. In Fig. 6 for current technology Glass-TPV, the PV electricity corresponds to 15\u201320% of the energy saving but it increases to 94\u2013126% for future technology. Using plastic modules (Plastic-TPV) and replacement every 10\u00a0years, the PV electricity contribution double to 32\u201341% of the energy saving for current technology and it increases to 110\u2013143% for future technology. The trend is similar for skylight. Covering the south direction of the building with TPV increased the PV production by 15\u201320% for Glass-TPV and 18\u201325% for Plastic-TPV, with the lowest increase in Phoenix and the largest in Honolulu. The combination of various energy sources in buildings highlights the importance of the cumulative energy approach since 1 GJ of natural gas burned in a furnace is not equivalent to 1 GJ consumed in an electrical furnace. In 2016, the production of 1 GJ of solar electricity prevented the production of 2.2\u20133.5 GJ of primary energy from the grid, depending on the location. By comparison, reducing the natural gas consumption by 1 GJ only reduces the CED by 1.3 GJ. The change in electricity production from the grid was included in this work. The grid efficiency factors are available in Table S15. Since the CED from manufacturing is negligible compared to the energy produced during the 20\u00a0years lifetime considered for this study, the energy return on investment (EROI) and the energy payback time (EPBT) (Fig. 7 ) were calculated for each scenario. An EROI greater than one implies that more energy is produced or saved due to the technology than used during its manufacturing. In Fig. 7, the range of values corresponds to the current and future cases. All scenarios considered have an EROI greater than 1. The combined energy savings and electricity production can result in a higher EROI for TPV than a traditional opaque organic PV. In Fig. 7, to compare with other types of solar modules, we used the results from a comprehensive review that included various types of modules manufactured after 2009 and calculated their EROI and EPBT, assuming a 25\u00a0years lifetime and 1000\u00a0W/m2 insolation [58]. We want to note that the best average normal insolation for the US is 970\u00a0W/m2, for a two-axis system. Therefore, the reference results for EROI are higher and EPBT lower than what is achievable in the US. The EROI allows the comparison of the same module in different applications, in our case, between the window and skylight application. The NEB in Fig. 6 was higher for the window than for the skylight application, but this was due to the specific building and module size considered. The EROI is higher for the skylight than for the window application since the orientation of the skylight at 21 degrees is more optimal than the vertical windows. The EROI for plastic TPV was lower than glass due to the module replacement after 10\u00a0years but would be similar to glass if plastic modules could last 20\u00a0years. The EROI metric compared to the NEB results provides a better insight into the diminishing return of covering the north side of the building. For example, in Phoenix, the EROI decreases from 102 to 83 for the glass application and best-case scenario. For the window application, Phoenix had the highest EROI (102 for SEW), while for the skylight application, Honolulu (208) was slightly higher than Phoenix (205). Previous studies for BIPV reported EROI for semi-transparent silicon modules that varied from 11.7 to 34.5 in Singapore, which was lower than what is calculated for all TPV in most locations in the US. The lower EROI can be attributed to the lower module efficiency of semi-transparent silicon PV, the additional light required to maintain the building operation [7], as well as the high manufacturing energy for silicon modules compared to organic photovoltaics [12]. In other BIPV applications in New York City where the silicon module was used as cladding rather than in window, the EROI was 7.2 [53], The higher EROI from this work demonstrates the benefit of OPV for building applications. The EPBT is a useful metric to quantify the time needed for the system to payback the energy that is required for manufacturing it. The EPBT needs to be lower than the lifetime of the energy system, which in this work was assumed to be 20\u00a0years. For all types of transparent photovoltaic modules and locations, the EPBT is less than 1.2\u00a0years. From the reference study, organic PV had the lowest EPBT reported to date at 113\u00a0days [58], but this works shows that the EPBT for transparent organic PV can be even shorter at 51\u00a0days for building-integrated application. In Fig. 7. (b), the EPBT is shown to vary from 51\u00a0days to 405\u00a0days (0.14\u20131.11\u00a0years) for all scenarios considered in this work. In addition to energy saving, the benefit of TPV in four locations in the US was evaluated based on the avoided cost and greenhouse gases for all scenarios. The detailed results are available in Tables S16-S17. The cumulative avoided cost and greenhouse gas emissions, which included the change in electricity and natural gas prices. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "for each location over time, and the changing electricity grid are shown in Fig. 7 for the best-case scenario of the window application. The highest value corresponds to SEWN. The NEB for glass SEWN in Honolulu was 22% higher than Detroit, but the energy saving was calculated to be 246% higher due to the highest cost of both electricity and natural gas. Due to its high electricity cost of more than 15\u00a2/kWh, Los Angeles had the second-largest energy saving even though it had the lowest net energy benefit. The second benefit of TPV is the reduction in greenhouse gases, which is illustrated in Fig. 8 (b). Currently, Honolulu has the highest carbon footprint at 897 kgCO2/MWh, but it has ambitious renewable energy goals and plans to replace its coal and oil electricity production with solar and wind. The forecasted carbon footprint in 2035 was calculated to be 189 kgCO2/MWh, which suggest that the greenhouse gases reduction due to TPV over time will decrease in Honolulu. The change in slope for the avoided emissions in Honolulu and Los Angeles is due to the important decrease in carbon footprint over time. By comparison, the carbon footprint in Phoenix will only slightly decrease due to the replacement of coal by natural gas, and in Detroit, nuclear is replaced with natural gas, which could increase the carbon footprint. In Los Angeles, there is also plans to more than double renewable energy sources. The current electricity production has already a low carbon footprint of 443 kgCO2/MWh, which is less than half the current impact of electricity production in Honolulu, the use of TPV results in the lowest GHG benefit. The cumulative energy saving for each location was used to calculate the maximum price of TPV per unit of area (USD/m2), which corresponds to a breakeven price for all the scenarios considered in each city. The range of values for each location corresponds to the current and future case scenario. Given that the current price of the module is unknown, the maximum price of the module is calculated. Rather than estimating the energy saving to the consumer, Fig. 9 . provides manufacturing cost goals for manufacturers. The highest prices per area were for Honolulu and the lowest for Detroit for all scenarios. The maximum price was lower for plastic modules due to their replacement every 10\u00a0years. It was calculated to be between 41 and 187$/m2 for low-efficiency solar cells and 88\u2013350 $/m2 for the best TPV modules. For the skylight application, the price was higher and varied from 137 to 759 $/m2. In the window application, the price range for each location was broader since the current case scenario assumed rapid degradation, and therefore the difference in electricity production was significant. The range for window applications was 80\u2013730 $/m2 while it was between 286 and 1565 $/m2 for the skylight application. The potential of manufacturing plastic modules moderate efficiency for retrofit at a very low price might result in the early commercialization of the plastic product rather than integration into the glass window, which will be more expensive.  We demonstrate, for the first time, the net energy benefit of transparent photovoltaics in building applications across the United States using a life cycle approach that considered electricity production and change in building performance. We accounted for a range of module performance possible today and in the near future (\u03b7\u00a0=\u00a03% T50\u00a0=\u00a07 yrs to: \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a010% T50\u00a0=\u00a025 yrs) and evaluated the technology impact in terms of energy and cost benefit. All scenarios had positive NEB and led to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs due to the energy saving in addition to electricity production. The NEB was used to calculate the EROI and EPBT, which were found to be either better or comparable to other photovoltaics technologies even when considering lower efficiency and replacement after 10\u00a0years. To evaluate the impact of transparent photovoltaics over time in each location, the effect of changing electricity grid and energy price was included in the greenhouse gas emissions and energy cost. This work was limited to one type of organic photovoltaics module.

Many novel energy conversion technologies have been developed on the basis of electrochemistry principles such as triiodide reduction reaction (IRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) []. Electrodes are important components in energy conversion devices and greatly affect device performance, such as device efficiency and stability. Traditionally, the Pt and Pt-based alloys exhibit superior electrochemical catalytic performance in IRR and HER, while the high price and scarcity severely hinder its widespread application []. On this basis, designing and developing low-cost and effective catalysts to replace Pt and Pt-based electrocatalysts are urgent. Recently, considerable electrocatalysts including carbon materials, metals and alloys, transition metal compounds, conducting polymers, and their composites have been widely developed []. Transition metal compounds like carbides, [] nitrides [], sulfides [,], oxides [], and selenides [] are promising catalyst materials due to the merits of abundance and Pt-like electronic structure []. Among these materials, molybdenum (Mo)-based transition metal compounds, such as MoO2, MoS2, MoP2, Mo2C, and Mo2N, are widely used in IRR and HER []. For instance, Jeong et al. reported that the MoS2 used as a catalyst in a solar cell exhibited a remarkable catalytic activity for IRR []. Moreover, 3D flower-like MoS2 nanosheets on candle soot prepared by Gao et al. exhibited superior electrochemical catalytic performance for HER in alkaline solution []. Compared with Mo-based monometallic compounds, the Mo-based bimetallic compounds exhibit superior catalytic activities due to their variable valence states and the synergistic interactions among different metal atoms []. Mo-based bimetallic compounds have been widely used in various applications like sensors [], lithium batteries [], supercapacitors [], and others []. Theerthagiri et al. fabricated Ni0.95Mo0.05S films via the electrochemical deposition method and used them as catalysts in solar cells to deliver a device efficiency of 7.15%, much higher than that with NiS catalysts (5.96%) []. Shao et al. synthesized CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 catalysts through one-step reaction method, which exhibited excellent electrochemical HER catalytic performance in wide pH ranges []. However, limited reports are available on Mo-based bimetallic oxide as efficient dual-function catalyst materials for IRR and HER. Aside from the catalytic property, conductivity is another essential factor that needs to be considered for an ideal electrochemical catalyst. Most transition bimetallic oxides have an excellent catalytic activity, but the low intrinsic conductivity limits their further application []. Therefore, many efforts have been conducted to further enhance the catalytic properties of transition bimetallic oxides. Inserting transition metal oxides into carbon materials (like graphene, carbon nanofiber, carbon nanotube, etc.) with conductive networks is an effective strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance based on their high conductivity, high catalytic activity, and good chemical stability []. Hou et al. reported that reduced graphene oxide (rGO) loaded flower-like ZnCo2O4 composite used as catalyst in solar cell obtained a remarkable device efficiency of 7.22% []. Recently, the biomass-derived carbon materials have acquired considerable attention due to their wide sources, facile synthesis process, and excellent catalytic activity []. Jing et al. synthesized onion-like graphitic carbon derived from brown coal via a facile self-sacrificed template strategy. The device based on the onion-like graphitic carbon treated at 800\u202f\u00b0C exhibited superior IRR capacity and delivered high device efficiency of 9.03% []. Fu et al. fabricated hierarchical porous carbon derived from walnut shell by facile KOH activation process under different temperature, and the device assembled with the porous carbon derived from walnut shell exhibited excellent electrochemical HER performance and delivered a Tafel slope of 69.76\u202fmV dec\u22121 []. In this regard, Mo-based bimetallic oxide combined with biomass-derived carbon materials can be an economical strategy for preparing cost-efficient and high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepared 3D aloe waste-derived carbon (3D-AWC)-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids via a facile co-precipitation method and systemically evaluated the IRR and HER performance of the as-prepared electrocatalysts. The combination of 3D-AWC and Mo-based bimetallic oxides significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity in IRR and HER. The ZnMoO4/3D-AWC assembled solar cell obtained the highest device efficiency of 7.65%, which is 13.50% higher than that of Pt (6.74%). The Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrids used as HER catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity in alkaline media. The ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts delivered low overpotential of 124, 135, and 156\u202fmV when current density is 10\u202fmA cm\u22122 and Tafel slope of 54, 76, 105\u202fmV dec\u22121 in 1.0\u202fM KOH, respectively. More importantly, the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts exhibited superior electrochemical stability in both IRR and HER.  The 3D-AWC was prepared via a facile chemical method. Prior to use, the aloe waste was rinsed by water and dried at 90\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fh. The dried aloe waste was pulverized to powders with grain size of about 2\u202f\u03bcm. After that, a certain amount of aloe waste powder (7\u202fg) was put in 140\u202fmL deionized (DI) water with stirring intensely for 4\u202fh. Subsequently, the liquor was put in autoclave with a total volume of 220\u202fmL and hydrothermal treatment at 230\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fh in an oven. After cooling, the precipitation was filtered with ethanol and DI water in turn until the filtrate become clear, and dried at 90\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fh to obtain a brown powder. 2\u202fg brown powder were added into 20\u202fmL DI water containing 4\u202fg solid-state KOH under intensely stirring for 4\u202fh. After the mixed solution was dried at 90\u202f\u00b0C for 12\u202fh, the powders were sintered at 800\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh at N2 flow to obtain black powder. The black powder was rinsed with 1.0\u202fM HCl and DI water to adjust the pH\u202f=\u202f7. The 3D-AWC was obtained by drying the black powder at 90\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fh. More details on the fabrication of biomass-derived carbon can be found in our previous works [,]. Mo-based bimetallic oxides and their nanohybrids were synthesized via a simple co-precipitation avenue (Scheme 1 ). The procedures were as follows: First, 1.236\u202fg of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O, Aladdin, 99.9% purity) and 0.336\u202fg of 3D-AWC were mixed in 50\u202fmL of DI water and stirred vigorously for 1\u202fh. NH3\u00b7H2O (2\u202fmol L\u22121) was dropped into the above solution until. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "pH\u202f=\u202f9. Then, 2.082\u202fg of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, Aladdin, 99.95% purity), 1.691\u202fg of copper (\u2161) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O, Aladdin, 99% purity), and 1.757\u202fg of manganese (\u2161) nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)2\u00b74H2O, Aladdin, 98% purity) were added in above solution and stirred vigorously for another 30\u202fmin to obtain three kinds of black precipitates, respectively. The precipitates were washed two times with ethanol, three times with DI water to reach pH\u202f=\u202f7, and dried at 90\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fh. Finally, the as-prepared ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC powders were obtained after annealing the precipitates at 600\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fh at N2 atmosphere. The ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 were synthesized via similar procedure without adding 3D-AWC in the beginning. The 3D-AWC, Mo-based bimetallic oxides and their nanaohybrids were prepared as follows: 0.2\u202fg of ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, MnMoO4, ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, MnMoO4/3D-AWC, and 3D-AWC powders were added into 5\u202fmL of isopropanol liquor containing 4\u202fg of ZrO2 pearls, respectively. The homogeneous solution was obtained by ball-milling for 4\u202fh and sprayed on FTO glass with an air brush. Before spraying, FTO glass substrates were rinsed with DI water, alcohol and acetone for 15\u202fmin in turn using an ultrasonic cleaner, and dried by a hot dryer. Subsequently, the FTO substrates loaded with as-prepared catalysts were sintered at 400\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin in N2 flow. For comparison, Pt electrodes were synthesized via a chemical reduction method. The H2PtCl6 isopropanol liquor was sprayed onto FTO glass substrates and annealed at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin [,]. Typically, 10\u202fmg of the prepared electrocatalyst (ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, MnMoO4/3D-AWC, and 3D-AWC) powders were dispersed separately in a mixed solution containing 1\u202fmL DI water\u2013ethanol mixture (VDI water/Vethanol\u202f=\u202f4) and 40\u202f\u03bcL Nafion solution (5\u202fwt.%) under ultrasonication for 30\u202fmin to obtain a uniform slurry. Afterward, 20\u202f\u03bcL of the homogenous slurry was dropped onto Ni foam by using a micropipette and dried at 60\u202f\u00b0C to obtain the corresponding HER electrodes. Before preparing the HER electrode, the Ni foam was rinsed by using acetone, alcohol, and DI water for 15\u202fmin in ultrasonic cleaner, respectively. After drying, the Ni foam was cut into samples with working area of 1\u202fcm2 to support the electrocatalysts. For comparison, the 20\u202fwt.% Pt/C was used in the present work. A sandwich solar cell comprises of dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, counter electrode, and redox couple electrolyte. The TiO2 photoanodes were sintered on a hot plate (JW-600FT, Wuhan, China) at 500\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fmin under air atmosphere. Then put the TiO2 photoanodes in the prepared N719 dye for 24\u202fh in dark condition. After soaking, dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were cleaned with alcohol and stove in air. The redox electrolyte was traditional I3 \u2212/I\u2212 redox couple comprising of 0.06\u202fM lithium iodide, 0.03\u202fM iodine, 0.5\u202fM 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 0.6\u202fM 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and 0.1\u202fM guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile liquor. In addition, two identical pair of counter electrodes and I3 \u2212/I\u2212 electrolyte were combined to form the symmetrical cell. An automated X-ray diffractometer (D/Max 2200, MDI, USA) was applied to detect X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared various materials. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL, Japan) was applied to detect the morphologies of as-prepared samples. The photocurrent density\u2013photovoltage (J\u2013V) profiles were carried out under the lighting conditions of AM 1.5\u202fG simulate sunlight (100\u202fmW/cm2) through solar simulator (Oriel 94023A, Newport, USA) with Keithley 2400 source meter. The whole electrochemical measurements were operated by using CHI660E electrochemical workstation (ChenHua, Shanghai, China). The cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were conducted to investigate electrocatalytic activities of as-prepared catalytic electrodes toward I3 \u2212/I\u2212 redox shuttle. CV tests were performed in standard three-electrode system, in which Pt used as counter electrode, Ag/Ag+ used as reference electrode, and prepared nanohybrid electrode used as working electrode in acetonitrile solution. The acetonitrile solution for CV test comprising of 0.1\u202fM ClLiO4, 10\u202fmM LiI, and 1\u202fmM I2. The Tafel polarization and EIS curves tests were measured based on the as-prepared symmetrical cells. For EIS tests, the test condition was 10\u202fmV of AC amplitude, \u22120.75\u202fV of a bias potential, and frequencies range of 100\u202fmHz to 1\u202fMHz. The electrolyte for EIS test comprising of 0.06\u202fM lithium iodide, 0.03\u202fM iodine, 0.5\u202fM 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 0.6\u202fM 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and 0.1\u202fM guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile solution. The measured impedance spectra were matched with Z-view simulation software using equivalent circuit model. The HER performances of as-prepared electrocatalysts were carried out in 1.0\u202fM KOH solution with a three-electrode system, in which graphite carbon applied as counter electrode, prepared HER electrode applied as working electrode, and Hg/HgO electrode applied as reference electrode, separately. Before electrochemical measurements, the electrolyte was saturated with N2 for 30\u202fmin to remove oxygen in three-electrode system. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were measured in voltage ranges of \u22120.8 \u223c \u22121.4\u202fV (vs. Hg/HgO electrode) with scanning rate of 5\u202fmV/s. All LSV polarization profiles were performed with 95% iR-compensated. Tafel slopes were obtained from the corresponding LSV curves. All potentials versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) were obtained on account of Nernst equation given by E RHE=E Hg/Hg O+0.059\u00d7pH\u202f+\u202f0.098. Long-term stability of electrocatalysts were estimated by LSV and chronopotentiometry (CP) measurements. All first-principle density functional theory (DFT) computations were conducted using Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [,]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used and the plane-wave cut off energy was set to 400\u202feV []. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernerhof (PBE) functional was adopted to represent the electronic exchange-correlation interaction []. The Monkhorst\u2013Pack k-point scheme was used in Brillouin zone (BZ) integrations []. The space groups for ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 were P1, Pna21, and C2/m, respectively. 20\u202f\u00c5 was assigned to eliminate the interactions between adjacent layers. The (102\u00af), (001), and (010) surfaces of ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 were studied, respectively, due to their stability and expose of metal atoms for the IRR and HER reactions. 15\u202f\u00c5 of vacuum layers were assigned to eliminate the interactions between adjacent layers. All the structures were fully converged and the maximum Hellmann\u2013Feynman forces acting on each atom were less than 0.05\u202feV/\u00c5.  Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of prepared samples. Two broad distinct peaks were located at 24.3\u00b0 and 43.4\u00b0, which corresponded to. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the (002) and (100) planes, respectively. These peaks suggest that as-prepared 3D-AWC is typically an amorphous structure (Fig. 1a). The characteristic peaks were similar to that XRD patterns of the biomass-derived carbon from fallen pine cone flowers, sunflower stalk, and pomelo peel [,,,]. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the as-prepared Mo-based bimetallic oxides were matched with the corresponding standard JCPDS cards (JCPDS: 35-0765 for ZnMoO4, JCPDS: 24-0055 for Cu3Mo2O9, and JCPDS: 50-1287 for MnMoO4, respectively), revealing that the Mo-based bimetallic oxides were successfully prepared via a feasible co-precipitation avenue (Fig. 1b\u2013d). The as-prepared ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 exhibited a triclinic, orthorhombic, and monoclinic crystal structure, respectively. In addition, the diffraction peaks of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC were similar to their corresponding Mo-based bimetallic oxides. However, the diffraction peaks at 24.3\u00b0 and 43.4\u00b0 for 3D-AWC were not obvious, which can be ascribed to the high intensity diffraction peaks of Mo-based bimetallic oxides that mask the diffraction peaks of the amorphous 3D-AWC. This phenomenon was similar to previous reports [,]. The existence of 3D-AWC can be further proved by the FESEM images. Fig. 2 depicts the FESEM images of 3D-AWC, Mo-based bimetallic oxides and their nanohybrids. As-prepared 3D-AWC exhibits a 3D network framework with abundant irregular pores over its entire (Fig. 2a). From the magnified image in Fig. 2b, the size of the irregular pores is between 200\u202fnm and 800\u202fnm. The unique 3D network structure of 3D-AWC can provide more electron transfer path and enhance the electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts [,,]. For the Mo-based bimetallic oxides, ZnMoO4 exhibits irregular-shaped particles formed by partial aggregation of spherical nanoparticles, which the individual size of ZnMoO4 ranges from 0.3\u202f\u03bcm to 0.62\u202f\u03bcm (Fig. 2c). The morphology of Cu3Mo2O9 also presents irregular-shape particles with a size between 0.6\u202f\u03bcm and 3.5\u202f\u03bcm (Fig. 2d). The MnMoO4 shows two kinds of morphology: the rod-like shape with about 0.8\u20131.2\u202f\u03bcm in width and 1.2\u20133.6\u202f\u03bcm in length, and the irregular bulk shape with a size ranging from 1.0\u202f\u03bcm to 5.0\u202f\u03bcm (Fig. 2e). Among the three Mo-based bimetallic oxides, the ZnMoO4 has the smallest particle size, which is beneficial to increasing the contact area between electrolyte and catalyst, and further enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. In case of Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrids, the Mo-based bimetallic oxide particles are distributed on the surface and pores of 3D-AWC (Fig. 2f\u2013h). The agglomeration and size of Mo-based bimetallic oxides are significantly reduced after introducing 3D-AWC, which is conducive to increasing the contact area between catalysts and redox couple eletrolyte, accelerating the electrochemical reaction process, and thus improving the electrocatalytic performance of catalysts [,]. Similar phenomena have been observed in previous reports [,]. For estimating the electrochemical catalytic activities of the Mo-based bimetallic oxides and their nanohybrid catalysts, CV tests were performed in a conventional three-electrode system. Fig. 3 a\u2013b display the CV curves of various catalysts and the related parameters are recorded in Table 1 . Generally, there are two pairs of typical oxidation\u2013reduction peaks on CV profiles. The oxidation\u2013reduction peaks at more positive potential is corresponded to the reaction between I3 \u2212 and I2 (Eq. (1)). The oxidation\u2013reduction peaks at more negative potential is related to the IRR (Eq. (2)), which is mainly focused. 3I2 + 2e\u2212 \u21cc 2I3 \u2212 I3 \u2212 + 2e\u2212 \u21cc 3I\u2212 No redox peaks of Mo-based bimetallic oxides can be observed (Fig. 3a), indicating their poor catalytic activities compared with 3D-AWC catalyst. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the adsorption of I3 \u2212 on the Mo-based bimetallic oxide surface, leading to the disappearance of the reduction peaks. Similar phenomenon can be found in previous works [,]. Compared with Mo-based bimetallic oxides, the 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids clearly exhibit two pairs of redox peaks (Fig. 3b), suggesting a smooth IRR on the surface of the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts and the rapid regeneration of sensitizers. Peak-to-peak separation (\u0394E p) and peak current density (I p) are two essential indicators for estimating the electrocatalytic activities of different catalysts. A small \u0394E p value means that the oxidation\u2013reduction reaction between I\u2212 and I3 \u2212 can proceed smoothly on the surface of the catalysts [,]. The \u0394E p values of the ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts are 435\u202fmV, 706\u202fmV, and 784\u202fmV (Table 1), respectively, which are much smaller than those of the ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 catalysts. This result confirms that the introduction of 3D-AWC into Mo-based bimetallic oxides can remarkably enhance the electrocatalytic activities of the nanohybrid catalysts toward the IRR. These results are similar to our previous works [,]. In terms of I p, a low I p value indicates a superior electrochemical catalytic activity of the catalyst []. The ZnMoO4/3D-AWC catalyst has an I p value of \u22121.78\u202fmA cm\u22122, which is lower than I p values of Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC (\u22121.51\u202fmA cm\u22122), MnMoO4/3D-AWC (\u22121.03\u202fmA cm\u22122), 3D-AWC (\u22121.29\u202fmA cm\u22122), and Pt (\u22121.29\u202fmA cm\u22122) electrodes (Table 1). The superior electrocatalytic activity of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC may be due to its small particle size, which increases the contact area between I3 \u2212/I\u2212 electrolyte and electrocatalyst, and further promotes IRR process. The I p results are compatible with the \u0394E p results. Tafel tests are operated to estimate the charge-transfer performance of the prepared electrocatalysts at catalyst/electrolyte interface. Tafel curves of the 3D-AWC, Mo-based bimetallic oxides and their nanohybrids, and Pt electrodes are depicted in Fig. 3c\u2013d. The exchange current density (J 0) and limiting diffusion current density (J lim) are two essential indicators for evaluating IRR ability of the catalysts and the diffusion ability of I3 \u2212 in redox couple [,,]. The J 0, obtained from the Tafel polarization curve slope, is varied inversely with charge transfer resistance (R ct) (Eq. (3)). A steep Tafel polarization curve means a high J 0, indicating that the catalyst material has a superior catalytic IRR activity [,]. The J 0 values of the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrids are in the order of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC\u202f>\u202fCu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC\u202f>\u202fMnMoO4/3D-AWC (Fig. 3d), which are much higher than those of ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, MnMoO4, and 3D-AWC catalysts and close to that of Pt catalyst. This finding demonstrates the superior electrocatalytic activities of. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts toward IRR. The J lim, expressed by the intersection of the cathodic branch with the Y-axis, is positively correlated with the diffusion coefficient (Eq. (4)). A large J lim means a rapid diffusion velocity of I3 \u2212 ions in I3 \u2212/I\u2212 electrolyte [,]. All 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrid catalysts deliver higher J lim values than their corresponding Mo-based bimetallic oxides, 3D-AWC, and Pt, indicating the faster diffusion rate of I3 \u2212 due to the 3D-AWC in Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrids. Tafel results are well in accordance with the CV results. J0=RTnFRct D=l2nFCJlim where R stands for gas constant, T refers thermodynamic temperature, n represents electrons number participating the IRR process at the interface between the redox shuttle and electrocatalyst, F stands for the Faraday constant, D refers the diffusion coefficient of I3 \u2212 ions in redox couple, C stands for I3 \u2212 concentration in the electrolytes, and l stands for the thickness of the spacer. To understand the electrocatalytic activities of as-prepared catalysts for IRR, the stimulated Nyquist plot with the equivalent circuit model as inset are depicted in Fig. 3e\u2013f and the fitted EIS values are displayed in Table 1. The first semicircle intercept on horizontal axis is related to series resistance (R s). The Mo-based bimetallic oxide catalysts exhibit similar R s values (10.02 \u03a9 cm2 for ZnMoO4, 10.54 \u03a9 cm2 for Cu3Mo2O9, and 10.27 \u03a9 cm2 for MnMoO4, respectively), while 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids, 3D-AWC, and Pt catalysts deliver slight difference in R s values (11.37 \u03a9 cm2 for ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, 10.56 \u03a9 cm2 for Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, 11.20 \u03a9 cm2 for MnMoO4/3D-AWC, 11.78 \u03a9 cm2 for 3D-AWC, and 10.81 \u03a9 cm2 for Pt, respectively). These slight differences in R s values can be attributed to the different adhesion property between the catalysts and FTO substrate [,]. To improve the interface adhesion between the electrode films and the substrates, several techniques have been proposed []. The semicircle observed in high frequency region is corresponded to R ct at catalytic electrode/redox couple interface. A lower R ct value means superior electrocatalytic IRR activity of electrocatalyst [,]. The R ct values of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC are 0.72, 1.44, and 2.16 \u03a9 cm2, respectively, which are much lower than those of ZnMoO4 (118.33 \u03a9 cm2), Cu3Mo2O9 (78.8 \u03a9 cm2), and MnMoO4 (61.75 \u03a9 cm2) (Table 1), indicating the superior charge transfer capability between the electrolyte couple and Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid interface. The significant improvement of the electrocatalytic performance of Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts may be attributed to the high electronic conductivity and fast electron transfer channel provided by the porous network structured 3D-AWC. The R ct value of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC (0.72 \u03a9 cm2) is lower than that of Pt (0.82 \u03a9 cm2), indicating the excellent catalytic activity of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC catalyst. The smaller R ct value means the higher catalytic properties for these electrocatalysts. Highly catalytic activity of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC can be attributed to its unique 3D network structure and enhanced electrocatalytic active sites. On the one hand, the unique 3D network structure of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC is beneficial to the diffusion of electrolyte and provides more electron transfer channels, accelerates electron transfer from FTO substrate to electrocatalytic active sites, and further accelerates the I3 \u2212 reduction. On the other hand, the 3D-AWC provides a superior support for ZnMoO4, in which the highly dispersed ZnMoO4 nanoparticles can expose more catalytic sites, increase the contact area between ZnMoO4/3D-AWC catalyst and electrolyte, and thus accelerate catalyzing the I3 \u2212 reduction at the surface of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC electrocatalyst. The EIS results are in accordance with the CV and Tafel results. In order to further explore the relationship between ion diffusivity and reaction kinetics of the as-prepared catalysts, the CV curves of Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts at various scanning rates are conducted and depicted in Fig. 4 a\u2013c. The \u0394E p values of all Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrids increase with the increase in scanning rate, confirming the quasi-reversible nature of the I3 \u2212/I\u2212 redox shuttle on the surface of the nanohybrid catalysts [,]. The redox peak current density increases as the scanning rate increases, indicating a weak iodide adsorption force, and no interaction between the electrolyte and the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts [,]. The linear relation between peak current density and the square root of scanning rates indicates that the oxidation\u2013reduction reaction on the electrocatalyst surface is mainly controlled by the diffusion of I3 \u2212/I\u2212 redox species (Fig. 4d), as demonstrated by previous reports [,]. The CV, Tafel and EIS measurements show that the introduction of 3D-AWC into Mo-based bimetallic oxides significantly enhances the catalytic activity of the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts. J\u2013V profiles of devices fabricated with as-prepared catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 5 a and relevant photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 1. The solar cells with ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 catalysts generate device efficiency of 2.47%, 2.39%, and 2.23%, respectively, indicating the poor catalytic activities of the Mo-based bimetallic oxides. The solar cells with ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC exhibit device efficiency of 7.65% (open-circuit voltage (V oc) = 0.69\u202fV, short-circuit current density (J sc)\u202f=\u202f16.41\u202fmA cm\u22122, fill factor (FF) = 0.67), 7.33% (V oc = 0.74\u202fV, J sc =15.71\u202fmA cm\u22122, FF = 0.63), and 6.92% (V oc = 0.65\u202fV, J sc\u202f=\u202f15.52\u202fmA cm\u22122, FF = 0.68), respectively, which are higher than that the solar cell with Pt (6.74%). The J sc and FF values of the solar cells with Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts are greatly increased after introducing the 3D-AWC, which is similar to the work of Wen et al. who designed NiCo2S4/C as catalyst in solar cells []. The improved J sc is beneficial to the dye molecule regeneration and the IRR. The reason for the increased FF can be that the excellent conductivity and low resistance provided by the porous 3D-AWC enable the photogenerated electrons to be sufficiently utilized. In general, the superior electrocatalytic activities of the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts can result from the synergistic effect of 3D-AWC and Mo-based bimetallic oxides. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the Mo-based bimetallic oxides provide abundant active. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "sites on the catalyst surface, which is conducive to promoting the IRR in electrolyte. The 3D-AWC is beneficial to enhancing the conductive ability of the nanohybrids and accelerating the electrons transfer in the redox couple electrolyte due to the multiple electron transfer channels provided by the porous network structured 3D-AWC. Considering the commercial applications of solar cells, it is necessary to estimate the long-term stability of catalyst [,]. The consecutive 50 cycles CV scanning and on\u2013off switch tests on the devices fabricated with ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts are carried out to evaluate their electrochemical stability. Fig. 6 shows the consecutive CV scanning for 50 cycles curves of the 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrid catalysts. No obvious changes in the CV curves are observed for the three Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts (ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC) after 50 cycles of consecutive scanning (Fig. 6a\u2013c), proving their superior electrochemical stability in I3 \u2212/I\u2212 electrolyte system. A slight decrease in the peak current values occurs with increasing CV scanning cycles (Fig. 6d\u2013f), which can be attributed to electrode degradation. This phenomenon is similar to published works conducted by Chen et al. and Yuan et al. [,]. No obvious changes are observed in the digital photographs before and after scanning based on the ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts, indicating their good adhesion on the FTO substrate [,]. This result further confirms the superior catalytic performance, rapid diffusion of electrolytes, and good electrochemical stability of the 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrid catalysts toward I3 \u2212/I\u2212 system. Fig. 7 presents the on\u2013off switch on the solar cells with ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts. The photocurrent density of solar cells with Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts increases abruptly at the \u201clight on\u201d state, indicating a rapid start-up capability under irradiation, suggesting the excellent electrocatalytic activities of Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts for IRR [,]. The photocurrent density values of solar cells based on Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts are in the order of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC\u202f>\u202fCu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC\u202f>\u202fMnMoO4/3D-AWC (Fig. 7a). This result suggests that the elecrocatalytic activity of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC is superior to those of Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts, which is in accordance with the CV, Tafel, EIS, and J\u2013V results. Furthermore, after eight on/off switches under irradiation for over 480\u202fs, the photocurrent densities are 92.55%, 92.55%, and 85.59% for the solar cells with ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts, respectively, demonstrating the good photoresponse (multiple startup) capability of the devices with Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts. For all solar cells with Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts, no significant change in V oc and FF values can be observed, whereas J sc and PCE values decrease slightly (Fig. 7b\u2013d), which can be attributed to the decrease in I3 \u2212 concentration [,]. The consecutive 50 cycles CV scanning and on\u2013off switch results demonstrate the remarkable electrochemical stability of the devices with 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrid catalysts. The HER electrocatalytic activities of 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrid catalysts are investigated in three-electrodes system with N2-saturated 1.0\u202fM KOH. Fig. 8 a presents the LSV polarization curves of as-prepared Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrids, 3D-AWC, and Pt/C (20\u202fwt.%) electrocatalysts with iR-correction. Compared with bare Ni foam with a negligible catalytic activity, the 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids exhibit better HER activity in alkaline electrolyte. In addition, as depicted in Fig. 8b, the Pt/C delivers an overpotential (\u03b7 10) of 54\u202fmV when the current density is 10\u202fmA cm\u22122, indicating its superior catalytic HER activity [,]. The \u03b7 10 of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC is 124\u202fmV, which is remarkably lower than that of Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC (135\u202fmV), MnMoO4/3D-AWC (156\u202fmV), and 3D-AWC (174\u202fmV). The LSV results confirm that the synergetic effect between Mo-based bimetallic oxides and 3D-AWC significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity toward HER. Fig. 8c depicts the Tafel plots of as-prepared 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrid catalysts in 1.0\u202fM KOH. Tafel slope, an important indicator for evaluating the inherent characters of elecctrocatalysts, was obtained by fitting the Tafel polarization plots on the basis of the Tafel equation (Eq. (5)): \u03b7=a+blogj where \u03b7 stands for overpotential, j represents current density, b refers Tafel slope. A small Tafel slope means rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics [,]. The Pt/C delivers a low Tafel slope of 37\u202fmV dec\u22121 in 1.0\u202fM KOH, which is in accordance with published reports [,]. The Tafel slope of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, MnMoO4/3D-AWC, and 3D-AWC is 54, 76, 105, and 111\u202fmV dec\u22121, respectively, suggesting the excellent HER electrocatalytic activities of Mo-based bimetallic oxides after introducing 3D-AWC. HER in alkaline electrolytes generally presents three mechanisms: Volmer mechanism, Heyrovsky mechanism, and Tafel mechanism [,,]. The Volmer mechanism is the electrochemical hydrogen adsorption (Hads) process and follows the reaction of H2O + e \u2212 \u2192 Hads + OH\u2212. The Heyrovsky and Tafel mechanisms are related to the chemical desorption process and follow the reaction of H2O + e \u2212 + Hads \u2192 H2 + OH\u2212, Hads + Hads\u2192 H2, respectively. In theory, the Tafel slope of the Volmer mechanism is 120\u202fmV dec\u22121, and Tafel slopes of the Heyrovsky and Tafel mechanism are 40\u202fmV dec\u22121 and 30\u202fmV dec\u22121, respectively [,]. The obtained Tafel slope values (54\u202fmV dec\u22121 for ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, 76\u202fmV dec\u22121 for Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and 105\u202fmV dec\u22121 for MnMoO4/3D-AWC, respectively) in the present work are between 40\u202fmV dec\u22121 and 120\u202fmV dec\u22121, demonstrating that the HER on 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts presents the Volmer\u2013Heyrosky mechanism. The electrochemical stability of as-synthesized electrocatalysts in HER were estimated by the LSV and CP tests. The LSV polarization curves of as-prepared 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts before and after 1000 CV cycles depict in Fig. 9 a\u2013c. The LSV polarization curves of ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts exhibit slight decline, indicating their excellent stability in alkaline media. Fig. 9d\u2013f display the CP plots of as-prepared Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts measured at current density of 10\u202fmA cm\u22122 in 1.0\u202fM KOH. After 10,000\u202fs, no obvious overpotential decline occurs for ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts, which confirms the superior electrochemical stability of the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts. The excellent electrochemical stability of the Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrid catalysts in HER lays a foundation for their large-scale applications. The designed 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids exhibit. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "excellent electrochemical catalytic activities and electrochemical stabilities in basic media for HER. For further understanding the HER performance at different conditions, the HER performance of 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxides was also conducted in acidic solution, as shown in the supporting information (Fig. S1 and Fig. S2). The electrocatalytic activities of 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic nanohybrids are not as high as those in alkaline solution, whereas the activity trend of these nanohybrid electrodes still holds in acidic electrolytes. The obtained 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activities and electrochemical stability for IRR and HER. In order to give insight into the intrinsic mechanism of 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrid electrocatalysts for IRR and HER, the electronic structure and work function of these Mo-based bimetallic oxide were investigated, similar to the previous literatures [,,]. The electronic properties of ZnMoO4 (102\u00af), MnMoO4 (010), and Cu3Mo2O9 (001) surface structures are calculated by DFT calculations. Fig. 10 displays the total density of state (TDOS) and project density of state (PDOS) of as-prepared electrocatalysts. The TDOS of ZnMoO4 (102\u00af), MnMoO4 (010), and Cu3Mo2O9 (001) in Fig. 10a\u2013c are non-zero at the Fermi energy level (Ef), indicating their metallic features on as-prepared Mo-based bimetallic oxide surface. In addition, the PDOS curves show that the bonding interaction was dominated by the hybridization of 4d (Mo) and 3d (Zn, Cu, and Mn) orbitals of metal atoms with the 2p orbital of O (Fig. 10d\u2013f). Benefiting from the 3D porous structure of 3D-AWC and favorable electron transport feature from the zero band gaps of the Mo-based bimetallic oxide surface, the electrons transfer in Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids becomes more easily, which results in the excellent electrocatalytic performance for IRR and HER. The calculated DOS results were consistent with the experimental results. Electron transfer between electrocatalysts and electrolyte interface is quite important part in electrocatalytic reactions [,]. Fig. 11 a\u2013c show the average electrostatic potential of the ZnMoO4 (102\u00af), MnMoO4 (010), and Cu3Mo2O9 (001) surfaces. The calculated work function values for ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 are 3.55\u202feV, 4.86\u202feV, and 3.62\u202feV, respectively. Fig. 11d shows the energy diagram where the energy levels of ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 surfaces are plotted with respect to the IRR and HER reactions. On the one hand, the Ef of ZnMoO4, Cu3Mo2O9, and MnMoO4 are 1.25\u202feV, 0.06\u202feV, and 1.18\u202feV higher than the I\u2212/I3 \u2212 equilibrium potential (\u22124.8\u202feV), respectively, indicating their superior electrocatalytic activity for IRR [,]. On the other hand, the Ef of ZnMoO4 and MnMoO4 are 0.85\u202feV and 0.78\u202feV higher than HER equilibrium potential (\u22124.4\u202feV), respectively, indicating superior electrocatalytic activity of ZnMoO4 and MnMoO4 for HER []. The proper Ef of ZnMoO4 and MnMoO4 make the electrons transfer more smoothly, thus accelerating the IRR and HER process. It is noted that the Ef of Cu3Mo2O9 is lower than the HER equilibrium potential (\u22124.4\u202feV), while its electrocatalytic performance for the HER can be achieved by the thermal activation. Actually, the work function of Cu3Mo2O9 surface is similar with the two-dimensional 1T-MoS2 (\u223c5.0\u202feV), which is widely studied for the HER []. Thus, the DFT calculation results manifest that all the investigated Mo-based bimetallic oxides (ZnMoO4, MnMoO4, and Cu3Mo2O9) can exhibit excellent catalytic activity due to their metallic characteristics and appropriate energy levels corresponding to the IRR and HER potentials.  Three types of 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids are designed as high-performance electrocatalysts for IRR and HER. In these 3D-AWC-supported Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids (ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC), Mo-based bimetallic oxides are distributed on the surface and inside of the porous 3D-AWC, which synergistically optimizes the active sites and enhances electron transfer in electrolyte. For IRR, the ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts exhibit fast electron transfer (R ct value of 0.72 \u03a9 cm2, 1.44 \u03a9 cm2, and 2.16 \u03a9 cm2 for ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC, respectively). The ZnMoO4/3D-AWC, Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC were used as electrocatalysts in solar cells obtain device efficiency of 7.65%, 7.33%, and 6.92%, respectively. For HER, the ZnMoO4/3D-AWC Cu3Mo2O9/3D-AWC, and MnMoO4/3D-AWC catalysts deliver low overpotential (124\u202fmV, 135\u202fmV, and 156\u202fmV, respectively) at current density of 10\u202fmA cm\u22122 and Tafel slope (54\u202fmV dec\u22121, 76\u202fmV dec\u22121, 105\u202fmV dec\u22121, respectively) in 1.0\u202fM KOH. The catalytic mechanism of Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids in IRR and HER is demonstrated by first-principle DFT calculations. The calculated DOS results illustrate the excellent metallic features on Mo-based bimetallic oxide surfaces. The calculated working function, higher than the I\u2212/I3 \u2212 and HER equilibrium potential, confirms superior catalytic performance of Mo-based bimetallic oxide nanohybrids for IRR and HER. Note that the function of electrocatalysts applied in solar cells and the hydrogen production possess some commonality. For example, fast electrons transfer and rich active sites are both required for IRR and HER fields.

However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is kinetically limited at the anode of a water electrolyzer. At actual operating current density, the high overpotential required for this reaction reduces the water splitting efficiency []. Currently, commercial IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts are known as OER catalysts with high activity. However, cost-effective OER catalysts that have lower overpotential than existing precious catalysts are required for the efficient and economical electrochemical water splitting []. Moreover, the most effective catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are based on Pt, which is costly and rare []. To address this issue, various OER and HER catalysts based on non-precious, earth-abundant elements have been explored, including transition metal oxides [,], (oxy)hydroxides [], nitrides [,], phosphides [], and sulfides [,]. Alkaline and Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers are attracting much attention because they can use non-precious metal catalysts. However, despite recent progress, most of water electrolysis reported so far require large overpotentials of \u2265 300 mV to reach current densities of \u226510 mA/cm2 in alkaline water electrolysis, and high current density of \u2265500 mA/cm2 to reach \u22651.8 Vcell in AEM water electrolysis [], and further improvement in OER and HER activities is needed to achieve low-overpotential water splitting. Chemical transformation often allows to produce nanostructures with an unconventional morphology or composition that cannot be achieved otherwise []. Corrosion is a chemical transformation reaction that occurs between metals with different reduction potentials facing each other [,]. Many studies have been done to prevent undesirable effects of the corrosion which cause damage or failure of metals and metal alloys. Here we demonstrate that corrosion can be harnessed to chemically transform a conventional metal foam into a high-performance OER electrode. Ni foams (NF) were corroded in aqueous solutions with Fe3+ and Co2+ cations to obtain OER electrodes composed of double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets with a ternary NiFeCo layer supported by NF, which exhibited an OER current density of 10 mA/cm2 at a potential of only 1.4 V (iR corrected). To our knowledge, the presented ternary NiFeCo LDH electrode is one of the most active OER electrodes in alkaline media reported to date []. This OER electrode was further converted to an HER electrode consisting of a ternary NiFeCo phosphide nanosheet array via a subsequent phosphidation process, which showed an HER activity as high as a commercial Pt/C catalyst. These two electrodes were coupled to construct an alkaline water electrolyzer that achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at only 1.47 Vcell (iR corrected), which was 160 mV better than the IrO2 and Pt/C catalyst pairs. We also used these electrodes to fabricate an AEM water electrolyzer that reached a cell current density of 500 mA/cm2 at only 1.75Vcell (without iR-corrected). Our electrodes showed excellent catalytic stability without compromising performance in both alkaline and AEM electrolyzers. Our synthesis method does not require the dispersion or coating technology of additional catalysts. Furthermore, this chemical transformation method is readily scalable, providing a promising route for large-area production of high-efficiency and low-cost OER and HER electrodes for efficient electrochemical water splitting.  The oxide layer on the NF surface was removed by reducing heat treatment in a H2/Ar atmosphere for 2 h at 800 \u00b0C in a tube furnace. The NF was immersed in an aqueous solution in which Co(CH3COO)2 (33.3 mM) and Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O (66.7 mM) were dissolved and heated at 95 \u00b0C for 36 h with magnetic stirring. The corroded electrodes were washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and dried in an oven at 80 \u00b0C for overnight. 0.39 mmol of Ni(NO3)2\u00b76H2O, 0.37 mmol of Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O, and 1.88 mmol of urea were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water in an autoclave reactor. The NF was immersed in the mixed solution and kept in a 120 \u00b0C oven for 12 h, then cooled to room temperature. The product was washed using deionized water and dried in an oven at 80 \u00b0C for overnight []. The product and NaH2PO2\u00b7H2O (1 mg) were placed at two separate positions in tube furnace and heated to 300 \u00b0C under a static N2 atmosphere for 2 h. The final product was cooled to room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from a SUPRA 55 V P (Carl Zeiss). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured using a JEM-2100 F microscope operated at 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a D8-Advances (Bruker AXS) diffractometer, equipped with a rotating anode and a CuKa radiation source (\u03bb =0.15418 nm). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis was performed with a TENSOR27 FT-IR instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained by using an ECSA2000 (VG Microtech.). Polarization curve measurements of OER and HER were performed using the CHI600D (CH instrument) at a scan rate of 1 mV/s at 1 M KOH with 85 % iR correction. The current density of polarization curve was calculated based on the geometric electrode area. Pt wire or graphite rod were used as OER and HER counter electrodes, respectively. Hg/HgO (in 1 M NaOH) electrode were used as reference electrode. Chronopotentiometric tests were performed using WBCS-3000 (Xeno Co.) in 1 and 10 M KOH. We measured the weight of NiFeCo LDH and NiFe phosphide contained in the electrode (1 cm2) using ICP (Optima 8300 model/ Perkin Elmer). The mass loading of NiFeCo LDH and NiFe phosphide was about 8.3 and 7.2 mg/cm2, respectively. In order to prepare an IrO2 or Pt/C electrodes, a mixture of a catalyst and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a binder was prepared in a weight ratio of 7:2. These mixtures were added to N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to prepare an ink, which was then coated on NF (1 cm2) and dried in an oven at 80 \u00b0C. The IrO2 and Pt/C loading was about 3.3 and 3.5 mg/cm2, respectively. All DFT calculations were carried out by Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [,]. Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [] exchange-correlation functional and projector augmented-wave (PAW) [] pseudo-potential. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "were adopted with spin-polarization. The on-site Coulomb repulsion U term was used for LDH model with 3d metals and the U value was 3.8 eV for Ni, 4.3 eV for Fe and 4.0 eV for Co according to the literatures [,]. During the structure optimization, the convergence criterion of total energy was set to 10\u22124 eV and the atoms were relaxed until the force acting on each atom was less than 0.03 eV/\u00c5. A plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV was used in all computations. Brillouin-zone sampling was sampled with 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5, 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1, 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7, and 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 1 Monkhorst-Pack grid for LDH bulk, LDH slab, phosphide bulk, and phosphide slab model calculations, respectively []. The bottom one layer of two layers was fixed in slab model and each slab model was separated from its neighbors by a sufficiently thick vacuum layer spacing. The Gibbs free energies of OER and HER were calculated by correcting the DFT energy with zero-point energy and entropy via \u0394G=\u0394E+\u0394ZPE-T\u0394S, where E is the DFT total energy, ZPE is the zero-point energy, T is the environment temperature, and S is the entropy. For zero-point energy correction and entropy calculations, the vibrational frequencies were calculated by employing density functional perturbation theory. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method was performed to find the minimum energy path for water dissociation step in alkaline HER []. The AEM water electrolyzer coupled the NiFeCo LDH on NF (anode, electrode size of 7.4 cm2), NiFeCo phosphide on NF (cathode, electrode size of 4.9 cm2), anion exchange membrane (AEM, X37-50 Grade T, Dioxide Materials) and gas diffusion layer (NF). The single cell was operated with an electrolyte of 1 M KOH at 50 \u00b0C at a rate of 48 mL/min. The AEM water electrolyzer measurements were performed with a BP2C electrochemical workstation (ZIVE LAB).  A surface oxide layer of NF with a porous three-dimensional structure was removed through reducing heat treatment (Fig. S1). The corrosion reaction was prepared by immersing the NF electrode in an aqueous solution in which Fe(NO3)3 and Co(CH3COO)2 were dissolved, and then heating the solution at 95 \u00b0C with magnetic stirring (Fig. 1 a). The corrosion process and OH\u2013 formation were the reduction potential difference of Ni2+/Ni and Fe3+/ Fe2+ and the formation of OH\u2013 trapped by the electrons released during the corrosion process and dissolved O2 []. A more detailed mechanism for the corrosion-based synthesis method was introduced in our previous reports [,]. The added Fe3+ and Co2+ cations and newly generated Ni2+ and Fe2+ cations can form hydroxide complexes, which serve as monomers for growth of ternary LDH nanosheets. Fig. 1b shows photographs of a corroded and phosphidated electrode fabricated in a large area of 20 \u00d7 9 cm2. After corrosion process, the color of the NF electrode changed from gray to yellow ocher, and then becomes black after phosphidation. A dense array of ultra-thin nanosheet was grown at the surface of the corroded NF. (Fig. 2 a and b). The crystal Structure of the corroded electrode was obtained by XRD analysis. The diffraction peaks of corrode electrode at 11.1, 22.6, 34.2, 38.4, 59.7, and 60.9\u00b0 (Fig. 2c) were indexed to (003), (006), (012), (015), (110), and (113) reflections of a hydrotalcite-like structure, respectively [,]. These results indicate that LDH nanosheets were formed on the electrode surface by the corrosion process. These nanosheets were separated from the corroded electrode, and then characterized by various methods. The elemental mapping and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the nanosheets showed that Ni, Fe, and Co elements were uniformly distributed in the nanosheets (Fig. 2d). The atomic ratio of Ni:Fe:Co in the ternary nanosheet was approximately 76:13:11 (Fig. S2). A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from a layered nanosheet clearly showed that it had a layered structure with an interlayer spacing of \u223c0.7 nm (Fig. S3). In the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum (Fig. S4), a strong absorption peak appeared at 1334 cm\u22121, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of NO3 \u2212 []. This observation indicates that NO3 \u2212 anions are released from Fe(NO3)3 and act as counter anions of LDH host layers. The binding energies of Ni, Fe, Co and O can be observed from the XPS spectrum in Fig. S5. The Ni 2p spectrum showed peaks corresponding with both Ni2+ and Ni3+ [,]. The Ni3+ appears to be formed from the partial oxidation in a LDH structure by OH\u2013 according to Ni(OH)2 + OH\u2013 \u2192 NiOOH + H2O + e\u2013 []. The Fe 2p spectrum also included peaks associated to both Fe2+ and Fe3+ []. The Fe2+ sites can be produced when Ni is oxidized and released electrons are trapped in Fe3+, which may account for the existence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species in a LDH structure. In the Co 2p spectrum, a peak at 780.8 eV originates from Co2+ []. In the O 1s spectrum, a peak at 531 eV corresponds to bound OH group [,]. These results confirmed the formation of a ternary NiFeCo LDH structure. We investigated the OER catalytic activity of the ternary NiFeCo LDH electrode. For comparison, we prepared commercial IrO2 catalyst (Fig. S6) as well as NiFe LDH on NF electrodes (Fig. S7) synthesized using the previously reported hydrothermal method. Fig. 2e shows polarization curves of OER for bare NF, ternary NiFeCo LDH electrode, NiFe LDH electrode and IrO2 catalyst (see also Fig. S8), which were recorded from positive to negative potential at a scan rate of 1 mV/s on the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale in 1 M KOH at room temperature. The NiFeCo LDH electrode only required 170 mV of overpotential at current density of 10 mA/cm2, which was 62, 121 and 201 mV lower than the NiFe LDH electrode, the IrO2 catalyst and bare NF, respectively, indicating the remarkably high OER activity of the NiFeCo LDH electrode. The NiFeCo LDH electrode also outperformed most of previously reported OER catalysts including mono- and multimetal. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "(oxy)hydroxides, oxides, nitrides, phosphides, and sulfides (Fig. 2f and Table S1). The NiFeCo LDH electrode still showed high OER mass activity based on the total mass (\u03b7 =200 mV at 10 mA/mg) compared with that of the NiFe LDH electrode (\u03b7 =258 mV at 10 mA/mg) and commercial IrO2 (\u03b7 =324 mV at 10 mA/mg) (Fig. S9). A Tafel slope of the NiFeCo LDH electrode was 36 mV/dec, which was lower than that of the NiFe LDH (39 mV/dec) and the IrO2 catalyst (67 mV/dec), representing a faster OER kinetics on the ternary NiFeCo LDH electrode (Fig. S10). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of electrodes can be calculated from electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) to the equation ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs = 0.04 m F/cm2 is the smooth-plane capacitance of the electrode at 1 M KOH (Fig. S11a\u2013c) []. The ECSA of the NiFeCo LDH electrode had a 65.0 cm\u22122 ECSA, which was larger than NiFe LDH electrode (47.5 cm\u22122 ECSA). We normalized the current density by the ECSA and the NiFeCo LDH electrode still exhibits higher activity than the NiFe LDH electrode, which indicates a high intrinsic catalytic activity (Fig. S11d). The catalytic stability of an OER electrode is essential for its practical application in water splitting. To evaluate the catalytic stability of the NiFeCo LDH electrode at large current densities, we ran OER on the electrode at a constant current density of 50 mA/cm2 for 70 h. As shown in Fig. S12a, the potential did not change noticeably during the OER stability evaluation, showing good catalytic stability for OER of NiFeCo LDH electrodes. The SEM (Fig. S12b) and XPS (Fig. S13) analysis further confirmed that the NiFeCo LDH nanosheets retained their morphology and chemical states after the durability test. To reveal the positive effect of Co2+ incorporation on alkaline OER, DFT calculation was carried out according to 4e transfer OER mechanism proposed by N\u00f8rskov (Fig. 3 ). The metal composition of calculation models was based on EPS data, and the (001) facet which represent the most dominant peak in the XRD data was selected as active surface. For metal LDH (001), the OER occurs at the O site where H is removed from the hydroxide termination []. The OER active site was an oxygen site surrounded by Ni atoms in NiFe LDH, while it was a site adjacent to the Co atom in NiFeCo LDH. The ideal OER catalyst requires Gibbs free energy of 1.23 eV for each step, so the overpotential value can be obtained by subtracting the 1.23 from the Gibbs free energy of the potential determining step (PDS). The PDS for NiFe LDH was the third step (*O \u2192 *OOH) and the overpotential was 0.68 V. One the other hand, the PDS for NiFeCo LDH was the second step (*O \u2192 *OOH) and the overpotential was 0.54 V. The relatively low overpotential of ternary LDH indicates that Co2+ incorporation improved the alkaline OER performance of NiFe-LDH. In addition, direct growth of nanosheet arrays on the electrode surface during the corrosion process allows intimate electrical contacts between them, enabling to achieve high electrical conductivity [,]. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis revealed that the NiFeCo LDH electrode had a charge-transfer resistance (Rct) as low as 0.35 \u03a9 (Fig. S14). Therefore, the high OER activity of the NiFeCo LDH electrode could be attributed to improved OER energetics on the ternary NiFeCo LDH nanosheet surface and high electrical conductivity obatined from direct growth of ternary NiFeCo LDH nanosheet on the electrode surface. Recently, transition metal phosphides were shown to be promising as efficient HER catalysts. The corrosion-derived NiFeCo LDH nanosheets were readily transformed into ternary NiFeCo phosphide nanosheets by phosphidation with sodium hypophosphite at 350 \u00b0C for 2 h. The SEM analysis of the product showed that sheet morphology was retained after phosphidation. (Fig. 4 a and b). The XRD diffraction peaks of phosphided electrode observed at 40.8, 47.3, 54.8, and 75.1\u00b0 were matched with (111), (210), (211), and (222) reflections, respectively, of hexagonal close packed structure ternary NiFeCo phosphide (Fig. 4c) []. The HRTEM image in Fig. S15 clearly shows single-crystal structures. The lattice spacing of the nanosheet was 0.221 nm, which is related to the (111) plane of the phosphide lattice []. The EDS analysis of the nanosheets that had been detached from the electrode revealed that an atomic ratio of (NiFeCo) to P was 2:1 (Fig. S16). Four elements, i.e., Ni, Fe, Co, and P, were uniformly distributed in the nanosheets, as shown in elemental mapping images (Fig. 4d). In the XPS analysis (Fig. S17), the Ni XPS 2p spectrum showed peaks correspond to Ni2+ []. Fe XPS 2p spectrum was observed as peaks containing both Fe2+ and Fe3+ []. In the Co XPS 2p spectrum, a peak at 781.9 eV originates from Co2+ []. In the P 2p3/2 spectrum, a peak at 129.8 eV corresponds to binding energy of P in Ni2P and a peak at 133.5 eV is corresponds to phosphorus species because of the oxidation of metal phosphides after exposure to air []. These results indicate successful chemical transformation of ternary NiFeCo LDH nanosheets into phosphide ones by the employed phosphidation process. We investigated the electrocatalytic properties of the phosphided electrode toward the HER in comparison with the NiFe phosphide (Fig. S18) and commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. S19) in 1 M KOH at room temperature. The NiFeCo phosphide electrode showed a largely improved HER activity (\u03b7 =37 mV at 10 mA/cm2) compared with that of the NiFe phosphide electrode (\u03b7 =174 mV at 10 mA/cm2), and its performance was comparable with that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst (\u03b7 =33 mV at 10 mA/cm2) (Fig. 4e). It should be noted that our NiFeCo phosphide electrode required relatively lower overpotentials to obtain desired current densities than most of other recently reported HER catalysts (Fig. 4f and Table S2). The NiFeCo phosphide electrode exhibited a high HER mass activity of 10 mA/mg based on the total mass of the catalyst at 72 mV (Fig.. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "S20). For the NiFeCo phosphide electrode, Tafel slope and Rct value were as low as 31 mV/dec (Fig. S21) and 0.84 \u03a9 (Fig. S22), respectively. The ECSA of the NiFeCo phosphide electrode had a 170 cm\u22122 ECSA, which was larger than NiFe phosphide electrode (125 cm\u22122 ECSA) (Fig. S23a\u2013c). We normalized the current density of HER by the ECSA and the NiFeCo phosphide electrode still exhibits higher activity, which indicates a high intrinsic catalytic activity (Fig. S23d). The NiFeCo phosphide nanosheets also exhibited the excellent stability without a noticeable change in HER performance (Fig. S24a), morphology (Fig. S24b) and chemical states (Fig. S25) at a constant current density of \u201350 mA/cm2 during a 70-h test. To elucidate why NiFeCo phosphide performed the better activity of alkaline HER than NiFe phosphide, DFT calculation was performed on both materials (Fig. 5 ). The phosphide slab models were created based on the EPS data, assuming that the metal composition of LDH remains similar in phosphide. According to the literature, P atoms on the surface of Ni2P(0001) reduce the number of active Ni sites and result in appropriate binding strength of the intermediates and the products, and thus the Ni2P(0001) surface can show good HER performance []. Therefore, (0001) facet has been used as a HER active surface for Ni2P in previous studies [,] and was also used in this work. The procedure of finding the most stable bulk structure and surface termination of NiFe phosphide and NiFeCo phosphide is shown in Fig. S26. The HER mechanism consists of two steps: H+ is adsorbed on the catalyst surface (Volmer step), and adsorbed hydrogen forms molecular hydrogen (Heyrovsky or Tafel step). Notably, in an alkaline media, H+ is supplied from the water dissociation process. The calculation results indicated that the alkaline HER over NiFe and NiFeCo phosphides depends on this water dissociation process, while the water adsorption and hydrogen molecule desorption steps do not require such large barriers. With Co incorporation, the energy barrier of water dissociation was lowered on NiFe phosphide by 0.05 eV. As a result, NiFeCo phosphide showed improved alkaline HER performance than NiFe phosphide. We constructed an alkaline water electrolyzer by coupling the ternary NiFeCo LDH anode with the NiFeCo phosphide cathode in an aqueous KOH solution. The water-splitting performance of our alkaline water electrolyzer far exceeded that of an alkaline water electrolyzer prepared by pairing the state-of-the-art IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. In 1 M KOH solution, the NiFeCo LDH//NiFeCo phosphide alkaline water electrolyzer only needed an overvoltage of 240 mV (1.47 Vcell), 160 mV lower than the IrO2//(Pt/C) alkaline water electrolyzer to achieve a cell current density of 10 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6 a). At an overvoltage of 400 mV (1.63 Vcell), our alkaline water electrolyzer showed the cell current density of 224 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6b), which was \u223c22.4 times higher than that the IrO2//(Pt/C) alkaline water electrolyzer (Fig. 6c). High pH conditions (\u223c6 to \u223c18 M KOH) and cell voltages (1.8\u20132.4 V) are often encountered in commercial alkaline water electrolyzers to obtain large current densities of 200\u2013400 mA/cm2 [,]. In 10 M KOH solution, the NiFeCo LDH//NiFeCo phosphide alkaline water electrolyzer reached a high cell current density 400 mA/cm2 only at a 1.57 Vcell at room temperature, illustrating that our alkaline water electrolyzer is capable of efficiently delivering large current densities at relatively low overpotentials. We performed splitting of water at constant current densities of 50 and 400 mA/cm2 in 1 and 10 M KOH solutions, respectively, and did not increase significantly in overvoltage during 70-h tests (Fig. 6d), indicating the good catalytic stability of our alkaline water electrolyzer. Light-driven water splitting is promising for sustainable H2 production. We also performed water splitting using a Si solar cell with an output voltage of 1.5 V under light emitting diode (LED) desk light (Figs. 6e and S27). Our alkaline water electrolyzer delivered the stable cell current density of \u223c17.5 mA/cm2 (Fig. 6f), which was similar to that obtained from water splitting driven by electrochemical power at an applied voltage of 1.5 V. An assembly of our alkaline water electrolyzer with a more efficient solar cell may enable to achieve improved solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. We also constructed an AEM water electrolyzer at 53\u223c55 \u00b0C in 1 M KOH solutions (Fig. 7 a and b). In the NiFeCo LDH//NiFeCo phosphide AEM water electrolyzer, the cell current density of 500 mA/cm2 was reached by applying just 1.72 Vcell (without iR-corrected) across the electrodes (Fig. 7c), which corresponds to energetic efficiency of 73 %. Our AEM water electrolyzer achieved the cell current density of 1235 mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.9 V, which was better than IrO2//(Pt/C) AEM water electrolyzer (1194 mA/cm2 at a 1.9 Vcell) previously reported in our lab []. In addition, our AEM water electrolyzer required lower cell voltages to obtain desired cell current density than for previously reported non-precious metal based on AEM water electrolyzers under the similar or same operating conditions (Fig. 7d and Table S3). The stability of our AEM water electrolyzer was evaluated by measuring the cell voltage at constant cell current density of 500 mA/cm2 (Fig. 7e). The AEM water electrolyzer performance was maintained without noticeable degradation in cell voltage \u2264 25 mV and a decrease in efficiency of \u2264 1 % during the 40-h tests. Therefore, our results show high catalytic activity and electrochemical stability for produce hydrogen using non- precious metal-based catalysts.  In summary, we have demonstrated a chemical transformation route to produce high-efficiency and cost-efficient OER and HER electrodes using a conventional metal foam as a starting material. We successfully obtained an OER electrode by the corrosion of a NF. The corroded electrode consisted of ternary NiFeCo LDH nanosheet arrays supported on the NF, and exhibited an unprecedentedly high OER activity, which could be attributed to high electrical conductivity from direct growth of the nanosheets on the NF and improved OER energetics on the ternary NiFeCo LDH nanosheets surface. This OER electrode could be converted to a high-performance HER electrode consisting of ternary. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "NiFeCo phosphide nanosheets by a subsequent phosphidation process. The alkaline water electrolyzer prepared by coupling these two NiFeCo LDH and phosphide electrodes produced a cell current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an only 1.47 Vcell in 1 M KOH, which outperformed the use of commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Also, the AEM water electrolyzer based on NiFeCo LDH and phosphide electrodes produced cell current density of 500 mA/cm2 at an only 1.75 Vcell in 1 M KOH. Hence, our approach opens a new and versatile avenue to fabricate engineered electrodes for water electrolysis and other catalytic applications.

{"filename": "/opt/ml/input/data/data/10.1016-j.apt.2018.02.013.txt", "paper": ["Up-conversion is a process that can transform near infrared (NIR) light into visible or ultraviolet light by means of multiple absorption or energy transfer processes [1\u20133]. Since the first report of UC process by Auzel, Ovsyankin and Feofilov in 1960 [4,5], up-conversion materials has become the hot focus of research topic due to their diverse applications in optical temperature sensors [6], display devices [7], medical diagnostics [8], photocatalysts [9] and solar cells [10]. Most of the lanthanide up-conversion studies have been focused on the investigation of lanthanide doped halides [11], glass [12], and some oxides [13,14] host materials. Trivalent rare-earth (RE) ions such as Ho3+, Tm3+, Er3+ and Pr3+ are usually chosen as activator ions for up-conversion luminescence because of their abundant energy levels for radiative transition. Specifically, Ho3+ is a extensively studied RE ion owing to its many radiative emissions in the visible and IR region [15]. However, for lack of suitable energy levels [16], Ho3+ cannot be excited directly to absorb 980\u202fnm photon. Therefore, Ho3+ is commonly used as co-dopant with Yb3+ to generate efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+ in up-conversion process due to Yb3+ has a large absorption cross-sectional area at 980\u202fnm [17\u201321]. Recently, RE doped semiconductors, like CdWO6 [22], BiVO4 [23] and Bi2MO6 [24,25] have attracted extensive attention due to their stable structure, high mechanical strength and low phonon energy. In the present work, Bi2WO6 has been chosen as the host material for the following reasons: First, Bi2WO6 is a typically layered Aurivillius oxide consisted of perovskite-like slab of WO6 to improve the covalency of crystals and the solubility of rare earth ions in Bi2WO6. Second, as a visible light driven photocatalyst, Bi2WO6 is most widely used for the degradation of various organic pollutants. But, it utilizes only the visible light but not broad solar energy (IR energy). Therefore, use of up-conversion agents (Ho3+/Yb3+) can convert IR light to visible light and hence, and can be utilized for harvesting large part of solar energy which is essential for higher photocatalytic activity. However, Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 has not been reported as far as we know. In the present study, Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 samples were successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal method followed by a heat treatment process, and the effects of Yb3+ concentration on the up-conversion luminescence properties were studied in detail. Meanwhile, the up-conversion mechanism was discussed based on the effective energy transfer process between Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions.  In this typical experiment, all the raw materials were analytical pure and used without further purification. Bi(NO3)3\u00b75H2O and Na2WO4\u00b72H2O in 2:1\u202fM ratio were dissolved in 30\u202fmL ethylene glycol and deionized water, respectively. 1\u202fmol% of holmium nitrate and ytterbium nitrate aqueous solution (3 mol%, 4\u202fmol%, 5\u202fmol% and 6\u202fmol%) were mixed to Bi(NO3)3\u00b75H2O solution dropwise to form homogeneous solution. Afterward, Na2WO4\u00b72H2O solution was slowly added to the above solution under magnetic stirring and the pH value was adjusted to 7.5 by using NaOH solution of 2\u202fmol/L. After stirring for about 40\u202fmin, the resulting solution was transferred to a 100\u202fmL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and hydrothermal reaction at 180\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh to form precipitates. The system was cooled to room temperature naturally and the samples were individually washed with ethanol absolute and deionized water three times by centrifuging process. Then, the obtained samples were calcined at 550\u202f\u00b0C for 4\u202fh. As a comparison, pure Bi2WO6 was prepared with the similar process without the addition of rare-earth elements. Conveniently, all samples are respectively marked hereafter as BIW-00, BIW-13, BIW-14, BIW-15 and BIW-16. The phase and crystallinity of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD-7000, SHIMADZU) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation source (\u03bb\u202f=\u202f0.1546\u202fnm, 40\u202fkV, 20\u202fmA) at a scanning rate of 5\u25e6/min in the range of 20\u201370\u25e6. The general morphologies and composition were observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-7800F). The chemical composition of the compounds was investigated by X-ray energy dispersion spectrum (EDS, X-Max50). The ultraviolet\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectrum were analyzed by an ultraviolet\u2013visible absorbance spectrophotometer (UV\u2013vis, Lambda35). The up-conversion luminescence spectra in the range of 500\u2013700\u202fnm were obtained by a fluorescence spectrometer (F-7000, Hitachi) equipped with 980\u202fnm laser diode excitation source. In order to compare the intensity of up-conversion luminescence, the different samples were measured under the identical conditions. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature.  Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized samples. Six significantly characteristic diffraction peaks which corresponding to (1\u202f3\u202f1), (2\u202f0\u202f0), (2\u202f0\u202f2), (1\u202f3\u202f3), (2\u202f6\u202f2) and (4\u202f4\u202f0) planes are observed. It can be found that the positions of diffraction peak of all samples could be well assigned to the orthorhombic phase of Bi2WO6 data (JCPDS file No. 39-0256), and no peaks about holmium and ytterbium or other impurities could be detected. This result indicates that the samples have the high degree of crystallinity. However, the diffraction peaks of Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 are widened and slightly moved to right. According to the estimated results of Scherrer equation [26], the crystalline size of Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 are slight smaller than that of Bi2WO6. The slight reduction of crystalline size could be ascribed to the larger Bi3+ ion (radii:117pm) is replaced by smaller Ho3+/Yb3+ ions (radii:90pm/101pm). It indicates that the Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions were introduced successfully into the Bi2WO6 lattice. The FESEM images of the BIW-00 and BIW-15 samples with different magnification are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen from Fig. 2(a,b), the BIW-00 sample is comprised of irregular sheets with thickness of 30\u201350\u202fnm and length of about 80\u2013150\u202fnm, and particles with the average diameter in the range of about 50\u2013100\u202fnm. By contrast, as is shown in Fig. 2(c,d), the BIW-15 sample completely consist of agglomerate particles with average diameter is about 40\u201360\u202fnm. The big variation of morphologies could be attributed to the Ho3+/Yb3+ ions easily fill the Bi2WO6 lattice vacancy, which may lead to the weak change of the Bi2WO6 crystal fields. In order to determine the elemental composition of Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6, Fig. 3 presents the EDS pattern of BIW-15 sample. The ratios of main element components are Bi (51.62\u202fwt%), W (22.80\u202fwt%), O (12.50\u202fwt%), Ho (0.77\u202fwt%) and Yb. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "(3.80\u202fwt%). The results also demonstrated that the Ho3+ and Yb3+ ions substituted for partial Bi3+ ion and doped in Bi2WO6 lattice network. Fig. 4 shows the UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples in the wavelength range of 300\u2013800\u202fnm. It can be seen that the samples have the strong absorption in visible light region and absorption edge about 465\u202fnm. Moreover, the band gap energy of the samples was estimated according to the Kubelka-Munk method in UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Calculated band gap of the Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 samples are smaller, which might be due to the doping Ho3+/Yb3+ in Bi2WO6 lattice that generates localized energy levels in the Bi2WO6 band gap. Similar behaviors have been also reported in literature [27]. Obviously, new absorption bands centered at 546\u202fnm and 647\u202fnm in visible light region are observed in the Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 samples. The two bands are assigned to the 5I8\u202f\u2192\u202f5F4, 5S2 and 5I8\u202f\u2192\u202f5F5 transitions of Ho3+ ions, respectively. The results exhibit clearly that more efficient energy transfer between Ho3+/Yb3+ ions and the Bi2WO6 lattice. The up-conversion emission spectra of Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 nanoparticles were measured at 980\u202fnm excitation. Fig. 5 (a) displays the typical up-conversion emission spectra (500\u2013700\u202fnm) of Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6. It shows that strong green and weak red emissions centered at 546\u202fnm and 655\u202fnm, which are respectively assigned to the 5F4, 5S2\u202f\u2192\u202f5I8 and 5F5\u202f\u2192\u202f5I8 transitions of Ho3+ ions. For different concentrations of Yb3+, the spectra exhibits same shape and position. However, it can be found that the concentration of Yb3+ affects not only the overall intensity of the up-conversion emissions, but also the intensity of each emission. The up-conversion intensity increases first and then decreases with the increases of Yb3+ concentration. The intensity reach its maximum value when the concentration of Yb3+ is 5\u202fmol%. This is due to the efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+. However, for the higher concentration, 6\u202fmol% of Yb3+, the intensity of the green and red emissions decrease drastically, which can be ascribed to the energy back transfer process from Ho3+ to Yb3+. According to the results of Fig. 5(a), the dependence of the green/red emission ratio (G/R) and the integrated intensity on the concentration of Yb3+ is investigated in Fig. 5(b). The highest integrated intensity is observed at 5\u202fmol% of Yb3+ (BIW-15) with only the G/R\u202f\u2248\u202f9.02, while the biggest G/R is obtained at 4\u202fmol% of Yb3+ (BIW-14). Therefore, it is reasonable to adjust color coordinates between green and red, and then obtain the light what we need by properly changing the concentration of Yb3+. In addition, it is not only the concentration of Yb3+ that determines the G/R but also the excitation power. Fig. 6 (a) shows emission spectra of the BIW-15 sample under two different excitation powers (50\u202fmW and 500\u202fmW). In this figure, the G/R increases from 7.40 to 11.17. Fig. 6(b) displays the G/R of all doped samples. the value of G/R for all doped samples increases slowly with the excitation power increases from 50 to 500\u202fmW. Based on the above results, adjusting the excitation power intensity may also get the light that we need. It is generally known that up-conversion process is the result of multi-photons interaction. The relationship between the up-conversion intensity (Iuc) and excitation power (P) by the expression, Iuc\u202f\u221d\u202fPn [7], where n is the number of absorbed photons in each emission photon process. Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 samples are analyzed and the results are displayed on a typical log-log plot in Fig. 7 (a\u2013d). The results show the up-conversion luminescence intensity increases with the increase of excitation power. And the value of calculated slope (n) for 546\u202fnm and 655\u202fnm emissions are near 2, indicating the above up-conversion process is belong to a two-photon process. However, the n values of the sample are 1.20, 1.31 and 1.47, which is far deviated from 2 for these two photon processes. The same phenomena were also reported in Ho3+/Yb3+-codoped ceramics [28], which can be attributed to the change of crystal field around the Ho3+ [29]. The pumping photons of 980\u202fnm can be efficiently absorbed by Yb3+. Typically, more Yb3+ become available to furnish and transfer energy to the Ho3+, but with the additional increase of the Yb3+ concentration, the shorter distance of neighboring Yb3+ increases the interaction of the neighboring Yb3+ and intensifies the cross-relaxation process of Ho3+ [30,31]. The up-conversion process depends strongly on energy transfer between Yb3+ and Ho3+. Based on the previous literature report [26,32], the up-conversion mechanism should be mainly included four processes: Ground State Absorption (GSA), Energy Transfer (ET), Excited State Absorption (ESA) and Energy Back Transfer (EBT). Fig. 8 shows energy level diagram of Ho3+ and Yb3+ for the possible up-conversion mechanism. Under the excitation of 980\u202fnm laser, an Yb3+ from the ground state (2F7/2) is excited to 2F5/2 level by the GSA process: 2F7/2 (Yb3+)\u202f+\u202fa 980\u202fnm photon\u202f\u2192\u202f2F5/2 (Yb3+), an adjacent Ho3+ from the ground state (5I8) is excited to the 5I6 level through the ET1 process. The ET2 process from 2F5/2 (Yb3+) level: 2F5/2 (Yb3+)\u202f+\u202f5I6 (Ho3+)\u202f\u2192\u202f2F7/2 (Yb3+)\u202f+\u202f5F4,5S2 (Ho3+) and then, the 5F4, 5S2 (Ho3+) level transitions to the ground state (5I8) and results in the green emission at 546\u202fnm. For the red emission at 655\u202fnm, it can be ascribed to the transition from 5F5 (Ho3+) level to the ground state (5I8), there are usually two possible routes to promote the population of 5F5 level. Firstly, 5F4, 5S2 (Ho3+) level can reach 5F5 level by means of non-radiative relaxation. Secondly, Yb3+ from the ground state (2F7/2) can be excited to 2F5/2 level by EBT process of Ho3+ and then, this Ho3+ can transit to 5I6 level and the metastable 5I6 level drops to 5I7 state by non-radiative relaxation followed by the ET3 process of another Yb3+, 2F5/2 (Yb3+)\u202f+\u202f5I7 (Ho3+)\u202f\u2192\u202f2F7/2 (Yb3+)\u202f+\u202f5F5 (Ho3+). Eventually, 5F5 (Ho3+) level returns to the ground state (5I8).  In conclusion, we have shown that a simple hydrothermal method followed by a heat treatment process may prepare Ho3+/Yb3+-Bi2WO6 nanoparticles that exhibit intense green infrared to visible up-conversion luminescence under excitation at 980\u202fnm. Bright green emission centered at 545\u202fnm accompanied with weak red emission. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "centered at 655\u202fnm were observed. Up-conversion mechanism in the material is involved a two-photon process and strongly depends on the concentration of Yb3+. Therefore, this study work provides the strong evidence for the feasibility of Bi2WO6 host material co-doped with Ho3+/Yb3+ to achieve desired infrared to visible up-conversion luminescence, and hence might be prospectively applied in photocatalysis and solar cells fields.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

Among all the methods of fabricating high qualified CIGS absorbers, the sputtering with post-selenization technique is promising for large-scale manufacturing . In this method, CIGS precursors are made from sputtering and then annealed in the H2Se or Se vapor atmosphere . There are mainly three kinds of precursors proposed by researchers: The first one is the metallic precursors, which is fabricated from sputtering of metallic or alloy targets . However, CIGS thin films made from this kind of precursors easily suffer from secondary phases and rough morphologies . Se or Se related compounds were added into the metallic precursors, resulting in the Se-containing precursors, to improve the crystallinity quality of CIGS thin films . Recently, Shi etc. have reported to fabricate the CIGS precursors by sputtering a single quaternary Cu(In0.7Ga0.3)Se2 target (single quaternary CIGS precursors for short). The key difference among the three kinds of precursors is the percentage of selenium atoms in them. Large number of experiments have been conducted about the CIGS thin film fabricated from the metallic, selenium-containing and single quaternary Cu(In,Ga)Se2 precursor respectively. However, rare experiments have been reported to investigate the influence of selenium content in the precursors on the properties of selenized CIGS thin films. To simplify the experiment, we use the CuInSe2 thin film as the materials system for research. We give a systematic comparison on CuInSe2 thin films made from precursors with different selenium content, and try to explain why the selenium content in the precursors can make a difference.  CuInSex (x = 0, 0.7, 1.3, 2) precursors with different selenium content were fabricated by sputtering of CuIn and then CuInSe2 targets. The bottom layers were CuIn and the top layers were CuInSe2. By adjusting the sputtering time, precursors with different content of selenium were obtained. The base pressure and sputtering pressure are 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123Pa and 0.7 Pa, respectively. And then those precursors were annealed at 550 \u00b0C degree in Ar/(8%)H2Se atmosphere for 30 min. In this paper, we call CuInSe2 thin films based on CuIn, CuInSe0.7, CuInSe1.3, CuInSe2 precursors as sample A, B, C, D respectively. The detailed information about composition of precursors and annealed thin films is listed in Table 1 . The properties of thin films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM), electron probe microscopy analysis(EPMA), X-ray Diffraction(XRD), Atom Force Microscopy and Hall effects measurement system.  The influence of selenium content of CuInSex precursors on the grain size of CuInSe2 thin films can be evaluated by the results of SEM images. Fig. 1 presents the SEM images of CuInSe2 thin films fabricated from the CuIn, CuInSe0.7, CuInSe1.3, CuInSe2 precursors. CuInSe2 thin films fabricated from the CuIn precursors have the largest size of grain (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). When the x value of precursors increased to 0.7 (Fig. 1(c) and (d)), the grain size of CuInSe2 thin films decreased and the CuInSe2 thin films had a relatively smoother surface. Furtherly increasing the selenium content in the CuInSex precursors, the grain size of the CuInSe2 thin films reduced even more (Fig. 1(e) and (f)). The CuInSe2 thin films fabricated from the CuInSe2 precursors have the smallest grain (Fig. 1(g) and (h)). Therefore, it can be concluded that content of selenium in the precursors can significantly influence the grain size of CuInSe2 thin films. Grain size of CuInSe2 can be decreased by increasing the selenium content in the CuInSex precursors. There are three possible explanations about why the grain size of CuInSe2 thin films can be affected by the selenium content of the CuInSex precursors. The first one is that the selenium in the precursors may limit the diffusion of metal atoms by forming ionic band. The higher percentage of selenium in the precursors, the higher amount of ionic band will be formed, resulting lower diffusion of atoms in CuInSe2 thin film during the growth process and thus smaller the grain size of CuInSe2 thin films. The second possible explanation is associated with the heat released during the seleniziation stage. According to the results of other group . Up to 200 kJ heat will be released when a mole of CuInSe2 is produced from Cu, In, Se atoms, which will heat the CuInSe2 thin films themselves and thus enhance the local temperature of those CuInSe2 thin films. Since the selenium atoms in the precursors have partly reacted with metal atoms and released the thermal energy, the amount of heat released during the process of selenization will be reduced, thus eventually lowering the local temperature of CuInSe2 thin films. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that when the x value of the CuInSex precursors increases, the local temperature of the CuInSe2 thin film during the selenization stage will drop, which will eventually reduce the grain size of CuInSe2 thin film. The third possible explanation is related to the morphology of CuInSe2 thin films. In our previous work , we found that the H2Se gas can only enhance the size of grains near the surface of CIGS, because the CIGS grains near the surface are easier exposed to the H2Se gas. It is reasonable to deduce that the thin films with rougher surface allow larger area to be exposed to the H2Se gas, thus the grains are allowed to gain more enhancement effect from the H2Se gas. The CuInSe2 thin films prepared from the CuIn precursors have the roughest surface, and the CuInSe2 thin films have gained largest enhancement effect from the H2Se gas during the selenization stage. Therefore, the roughness of the CuInSe2 drops as well as enhancement effect obtained from H2Se gas during the selenization stage will be reduced as the selenium content in the CuInSex precursors increases. The roughness of the CuInSe2 surface is one of the key factors to fabricate high qualified CuInSe2 absorbers. AFM was employed to measure the roughness of CuInSe2 thin film made from CuInSex with different. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "value of x. Fig. 2 shows the connection between the roughness of CuInSe2 thin films and the x value in the CuInSex precursors. The roughness (rms) of CuInSe2 was up to 379.8 nm when there was no selenium in the CuInSex precursors (x = 0). However, when the x value was increased to 0.7, the roughness of CuInSe2 thin film rapidly reduced to 90.5 nm. Furtherly increasing the x value will reduce the roughness of CuInSe2 thin film even more. This phenomenon illustrated that CuInSe2 thin films prepared from metallic precursors have difficulty in achieving smooth surface and that adding selenium into the precursors is an effectively way to reduce the surface roughness. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of CuInSe2 thin films fabricated from the CuInSex with different value of x. All the samples have CuInSe2 phase. When x = 0 (the black line), the CuInSe2 thin films not only contain CuInSe2 phase, but also have Cu2Se and CuIn phase. Increasing the value of x to 0.7, the intensity of corresponding peaks decreases, which means amount of Cu2Se and CuIn phase in the thin films decreases. Furtherly enhancing the values of x decreases the amount of Cu2Se and CuIn phase in the thin films even more. When x = 2, no Cu2Se and CuIn phase can be found by XRD measurement in the CuInSe2 thin films. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the higher value of x in the CuInSex precursors, the less Cu2Se and CuIn phase in the CuInSe2 thin films. The results of the SEM image show a numbers of islands in the CuInSe2 thin films prepared from metallic precursors. This phenomenon indicates that the phase separation may exist in the CuInSe2 thin films. EPMA mapping was employed to investigate the possible phase separation and show the 2D distribution of Cu, In, Se elements in the CuInSe2 thin films. When there was no selenium in the precursors (x = 0), the Cu, In and Se elements were found to have an inhomogeneous distribution. The main structure of the distribution of all the three kinds of elements were similar, which implied that the islands in the CuInSe2 were mainly CuInSe2 phase. In area 1 and 2, the distributions of Cu, In, Se had almost the same pattern. These areas may have no phase separation. In area 3, however, the phase separation happened. Selenium deficiency could be found while Cu and In element didn\u2019t have such deficiency. Therefore, we can deduce that Cu-rich and In-rich, or Cu-In phase existed in area 3. According to the results of XRD, Cu2Se or/and CuIn phase may existed in this area. When the value of x increase to 0.7, the elemental distribution became more uniform, but the lateral compositional distributions were still inhomogeneous. The marked area 1 was a selenium deficiency area. According to XRD patterns, CuIn and Cu2Se phase existed in CuInSe2 thin film fabricated from CuInSex with x of 0.7. Therefore, CuIn and Cu2Se phase may exist in area 1. The marked 2 and 4 areas were the In-rich and the Se-rich areas. Therefore, In-Se phase may existed in these area. This phase was not shown in the XRD patterns. One possible reason is that the positions of the diffraction peaks of and In-Se phase and CuInSe2 phase are difficult to distinguish from XRD pattern. The marked 3 and 5 areas are rich in In and poor in Se. Therefore, CuIn phase may exist in these area. Furtherly increasing the value of x to 1.3, the uneven distribution of Cu, In, Se elements in the annealed CuInSe2 thin films disappeared. When the x was increased to 2, the elemental distributions were even more uniform. From the above phenomenon, we can find that the selenium content of CuInSex precursors have a great impact on the compositional distributions of the CuInSe2 thin films. The uneven distribution of elements or the phase separation in the CuInSe2 prepared from CuInSex precursors can be effectively depressed by adding selenium into the precursors (Fig. 4 ). Fig. 5 presents the relationship of carrier mobility of CuInSe2 thin film with the x value in CuInSex precursors. The CuInSe2 thin films have the largest carrier mobility when the x value is 0 and the carrier mobility of CuInSe2 reduces as the x value increases. A possible explanation about this phenomenon is related to the crystallinity of the CuInSe2 thin film, which can be influenced by the selenium content in the precursors. Since CuInSe2 thin films made from the CuInSex precursors with higher x value have smaller size of grains, those CuInSe2 thin films will have higher concentration of crystal boundaries and crystal defects, thus increasing the possibility of electrical scattering. Therefore, the CuInSe2 thin films will obtain lower carrier mobility as the selenium content of the CuInSex precursors increase.  In this study, we investigated the influence of selenium content in the CuInSex precursors on the properties of the CuInSe2 thin films. Our results show that the CuInSe2 thin films prepared from CuIn metallic precursors have the largest grains, highest mobility of carriers, as well as the phase separation. Also CuInSe2 thin films based on the CuIn precursors have the largest roughness, which is undesirable for solar cells device to achieve high performance. Adding selenium into the metallic precursors will reduce surface roughness, the grain size and the carrier mobility of CuInSe2 thin films, while increase the uniformity of the elemental distribution.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).

The nanoparticles exhibit unique physicochemical properties due to their nanoscale and large specific surface area . Nanoparticles of silica are used in biomedical applications because of their large surface area, the ability to functionalize, electrical application as solar cells , photocatalytic application, including application in combination with TiO2, or Ag nanoparticles . The sol-gel process is mainly defined as a process of producing inorganic oxides from metal alkoxides. Sol is a stable colloidal suspension of colloidal solid particles in a liquid. Sol can be transformed to gel using the gelation process through the gel-point where the sol solution suddenly changes from fluid liquid, through a viscous state, to a solid state called the gel . Compounds with the chemical formula M(OR)z are also called alkoxides. These compounds are usually in the form of a liquid solution formed through direct or indirect reactions between metal M and alcohol ROH. In general, the sol-gel process consists of hydrolysis and condensation processes. The reaction of hydrolysis occurs in the presence of water, where a controlled addition of H2O allows to regulate both of the processes. The result of the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane alkoxides in acidic conditions is silanol, which belongs to the Si-OH group, formed through hydroxoligands bonded to central silicon atoms (1). The linking of the silanol group leads to the formation of a polymer chain with a small amount of branching points. The reaction of the condensation proceeds with the formation of a three-dimensional network becomes a solid state . Sol-gel is a colloidal and chemistry route to obtain oxide ceramics with an intermediate sol and gel state. The product of the sol-gel process in the form of a viscous liquid can be spun into fibres or even coating materials using the electrospinning technique. A controlled gelation process allows for the formation of monosized droplets and fibres of several dozen or hundreds of nanometres . In the last fifteen years, a constant interest of the scientific community in the electrospinning method from a solution has been observed. The method allows to obtain polymer and composite nanofibres, while maintaining a low cost of production on both the laboratory as well as the industrial scale. Due to their nanometric size and the inability to obtain them in the case of conventional material physical properties, these types of materials are becoming increasingly recognised due to their wide application possibilities. Composite nanofibres in the polymer matrix with polyvinylpyrrolidone, which are reinforced with nanoparticles, have a number of applications, such as relative humidity sensors , fluorescent and clothing applications , layers to protect from UV radiation and advanced materials intended for applications in the electronics industry . Due to their physical properties, silicon oxide nanoparticles produced by the zol-gel method are used to produce sensors and biosensors as well as photonic crystals . Using them as a nanofiller in composite nanofibres contributes to an improvement of the mechanical properties of the obtained fibrous composite layers, meaning that this type of material can be used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries . In addition, fibrous composite materials based on PVP that are reinforced with SiO2 nanoparticles can be used as temperature-regulating textiles, solar energy utilisation, building energy efficiency and have potential in building energy conservation . This work focuses on an analysis of the morphology and optical properties of composite PVP nanofibres reinforced with SiO2 nanostructures. In the first place, amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles were produced using the zol-gel method, the structure and morphology of which were tested using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Then, using the generated SiO2 nanostructures, the spinning solutions were prepared based on PVP and ethanol containing 0 and 5% mass concentrations of nanopowders used to produce a thin polymer and composite mats using the electrospinning method. The morphology and chemical composition of the produced materials were tested using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). An analysis of the impact of the reinforcing phase on the optical properties of nanofibres was carried out on the basis of UV\u2013vis spectra, based on which the rated values of band gaps of the produced thin fibrous mats were assessed.  Four components were used for the preparation of silica sols: tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Si(OC2H5)4 with purity of \u226597%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 38%), ethanol (anhydrous C3H5OH, with purity of 99.8%) and distilled water. The silica precursor was mixed with a 40 ml solution of ethanol and 0,2 ml of HCl (hydrolysis catalyst) under stirring conditions. Subsequently, after 30 min of stirring, distilled water was added into the solution at a molar ratio of TEOS:H2O, 1:2. The solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer during the addition process for at least 2 h. As a result of the sol-gel process, a white colloidal suspension was obtained. After 24 h, the solution was subjected to drying until a white powder was obtained and then calcination at 550 \u00b0C for 2 h in order to obtain a white silica nanopowder Two spinning solutions were applied in order to create a fibrous mat with the electrospinning method. The first one was a pure polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone solution (PVP, purity of 99%, Mw = 130 000 000 g/mol) in ethanol (EtOH, purity 99.8%) with a 15% mass concentration of polymer. Whereas in the second case, silicon oxide nanoparticles were added to ethanol, equivalent to 5% of the mass concentration in relation to the amount of polymer, which was previously produced using the zol-gel method. The mixture of SiO2/EtOH was subjected to the sonication process for 1 h in order to eliminate agglomerates of nanoparticles. Then, the polymer was added and everything was mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 2 h to obtain a 15% solution of PVP/EtOh containing 5% (weight) silicon oxide nanoparticles in relation to the polymer. Using. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "the prepared solutions, a nanofibrous polymer and composite mats were produced using the FLOW-Nanotechnology Solutions Electrospinner 2.2.0\u2013500. During the electrospinning process, fixed process parameters were applied, i.e.: distance and tension between the nozzle and the manifold (15 cm, 15 kV) and a solution flow rate of 4 ml/h. In order to carry out an analysis of the morphology and structure of the produced materials, nanofibres were applied on a thin aluminium foil, while in the case of optical tests, layers were applied directly on specially prepared glass substrates. In order to analyse the morphology and structures of the produced SiO2 nanoparticles, a high-resolution transmission electron microscope TITAN 80-300 by FEI (TEM) was applied. Using the taken TEM images, a fifty-fold diameter measurement was carried on randomly selected nanoparticles of silicon oxide, and the results were presented in the form of a histogram. In addition, using the TEM image of SiO2 nanopowders and the DigitalMicrograph program, the Fourier transformation was carried out in order to analyse the structure of the produced silica particles, and the results were compared with the ones obtained during x-ray using the (XRD) X'Pert Pro diffractometer by Panalytical. The measurement was carried out by the stepping method (a step every 0.026\u00b0 and sometimes a step equal to 30s) in the geometry of Bragg-Brentano by using the PIXcel 3D detector on a bent axis beam. Filtered radiation of a lamp with a cobalt anode (\u03bbK\u03b1 = 0.17909 nm) powered with 40 kV with current glow of 30 mA was used. The tests of the morphology of the produced fibrous mats were carried out based on the imaging surface topography, carried out with scanning tunneling electron microscope (SEM) Zeiss Supra 35, and their chemical composition was specified using EDS spectra from the x-ray spectrometer Trident XM4 (EDX). An analysis of the optical properties of the obtained materials was carried out using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer Evolution 220 Thermo-Scientific. During the test, a light beam with a wavelength in the range of 190\u2013500 nm was on the sample at an angle of 8\u00b0. The method presented in works was applied to specify energy breaks.  An analysis of the morphology of the SiO2 nanopowder produced by the zol-gel method showed that the obtained particles were of a spherical shape and their diameter was in the range from 10 to 40 nm (Fig. 1 a). A fifty-fold measurement of the diameters of randomly selected particles showed that the average particle diameter of the obtained powder was approx. 23 nm, and the largest group, i.e. 84%, included nanoparticles with diameters of 15\u201330 nm (Fig. 1b). The size of the obtained particles is especially beneficial in the case of using the silicon oxide nanopowder in the biological area for in vitro contrast imaging of cells, as reported by Gao et al. and Jin et al. . As a result of the carried out Fourier transformation, in order to analyse the structure of a single particle of the produced SiO2 powder, an image resembling fuzzy circles was obtained, which proves the amorphous structure of the tested nanoparticles (Fig. 1c). This fact was confirmed with tests using the x-ray diffractometer. The recorded XRD spectrum of the obtained SiO2 nanopowder based on the zol-gel method showed the presence of a fuzzy diffractive line, i.e. widening of liquid, which is the result of diffraction beams of x-ray radiation on an amorphous structure (Fig. 1d). The angular position of the diffraction line corresponded to the amorphous structure SiO2, in accordance with the data contained in the database JCPDS-ICDD. In order to analyse the morphology of the PVP polymer and the PVP/SiO2 composite nanofibres, obtained using the electrospinning process from 15% polyvinylpyrrolidone solutions in ethanol at 0 and a 15% concentration of silicon oxide nanoparticle, surface topography imaging was carried out for the produced thin fibrous mats using a scanning electron microscope SEM (Fig. 2 a and c). The application of solid process parameters of the electrostatic spinning, including distance and potential difference between electrodes of 15 cm and 15 kV, respectively, and a solution flow rate of 4 ml/h, contributed to the obtainment of thin fibrous polymer and composite mats. An analysis of the morphology of the produced fibrous mats with polyvinylpyrrolidone, carried out based on surface imaging, performed with 10 000 times enlargement, revealed that the obtained fibres were characterised by constant diameters along their entire length, a uniform surface without pores, and no adverse defect structure in the form of the so-called beads (Fig. 2a). The diameters of 50 randomly selected fibres were measured using the obtained SEM images of the topography of the fibrous polymer mat surface as well as the DigitalMicrograph program. The obtained results showed that the produced non-woven consisted of fibres with a large variety of diameters, ranging from 800 to 1700 nm. The obtained diameters of fibres in excess of 1 \u03bcm are probably the result of the connection of large mass concentration of PVP/EtoH solution of 15% and the significant flow of solution in the amount of 4 ml/l. A designated average diameter of the obtained PVP fibres was 1164 nm, and the largest group of fibres, i.e. 28%, was of a diameter ranging from 1200 to 1300 nm (Fig. 2b). The test of the morphology of thin fibrous composite mats produced from a 15% polyvinylpyrrolidone solution in ethanol containing silicon oxide nanoparticles in quantities corresponding to 5% mass concentration with respect to the obtained polymer composite fibre showed that, in contrast to the fibres obtained from a pure polymer solution, they were characterised by lower values of diameters and number of defects of the structure, in the form of agglomerates the reinforcement phase (Fig. 2c). \u201cToni E. Newsome and Susan V. Olesik\u201d in the work presented a method of production of nanocomposite fibers with a polyvinylpyrrolidone matrix with reinforcement in the form of silica nanoparticles. The nonwovens obtained were characterized by a uniform dispersion of nanoparticles inside and on the surface of nanofibres produced. Comparing the diameter of SiO2 nanoparticles,. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "nanopowders applied, it can be concluded that the formation of defects in the structure of PVP/SiO2 nanofibers obtained, probably due to the tendency to form agglomerates of the reinforcing phase applied is related to the size of the nanoparticles applied. The use of particles with a smaller diameter results in the increase in the number of defects in the structure of nanofibers obtained. The tendency to form agglomerates of nanoparticles can be explained by the fact that smaller particles of SiO2 applied by the authors and produced by the sol-gel method, whose average diameter is about 23 nm, have a much larger surface area in relation to more than 10 times larger silica particles used as a reinforcing phase by the authors of the work (diameter of a single particle of 250 nm) and consequently the adhesion strength per mass unit, responsible for the ability of the reinforcing phase to bind in the agglomerates is greater.\" Adding the reinforcing phase in the form of manufactured SiO2 nanoparticles contributed to obtaining composite fibres with diameters in the range from 50 to 1570 nm. The largest group (46% of all fibres) involved PVP/SiO2 nanofibres with diameters below 200 nm, while the average fibre diameter determined based on the fifty-fold measurement was 358 nm. The decrease in the diameter of fibres of the produced composite PVP non-woven reinforced with silicon oxide, in relation to the fibres obtained from a clean 15% polymer solution, is caused by reduced surface tension in the spinning solution, probably caused by the presence of SiO2 nanoparticles. The tests of the chemical composition of the produced fibrous mats (Fig. 2b and d), carried out using X-ray analysis in the micro-regions with an X-ray spectrometer, confirmed the presence of silicon oxide nanoparticles in fibres, wherein the strongest signal of SiO2 recorded in EDS spectra was observed in the point analysis of macro-agglomerates of the reinforcing phase visible on the SEM image (Fig. 2c) (the presence in EDS spectrum of peaks derived from aluminium is due to the use of aluminium foil as a substrate, on which fibres were deposited during the electrospinning process). The reduction of fibre diameters of the obtained composite PVP mat/SiO2 nanoparticle is particularly attractive in the case of using this type of material for the production of filters and sensors, because of the substantial increase in the surface area of \u200b\u200bthe composite non-woven mat with a pure polymer. In order to analyse the optical properties of the produced thin fibrous polymer PVP mats and composite PVP/SiO2 mats, UV\u2013vis spectra were applied for electromagnetic radiation from 190 to 500 nm using a spectrophotometer (Fig. 3 a). The spectrum of radiation absorption as a function of wavelength falling on a sample, obtained for a mat from undoped polymer PVP fibres, was characterised by a sharp edge of absorption for quantum of radiation with a wavelength below 320 nm. In addition, two absorption maxima were registered in the range of ultraviolet radiation indirectly attributable to a wavelength of approx. 290 nm and 220, which coincides with the absorption spectra obtained for a thin layer made of pure polyvinylpyrrolidone presented in the work . The increase in the radiation absorption of PVP fibres in the UV areas is probably due to the type of transitions n\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c0* occurring between pairs of free charge carriers derived from oxygen atoms and vacant state of energy n\u2009\u2192\u2009\u03c0* \u2212orbital in pyrrolidone ring between individual atoms of carbon and oxygen, which are characteristic for organic compounds belonging to the used polymer. For the silicon oxide nanopowder produced using the zol-gel method, the obtained UV\u2013vis spectrum showed no absorption of radiation in the visible light range. SiO2 nanoparticles showed strong absorption for ultraviolet wavelengths below 230 nm, which is consistent with the results presented by Xu et al. . This phenomenon can be caused by defects of the surface structure of the produced nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of an incomplete four-wall network of Si O Si, which show the local optical activity, and in this case, they can be the so-called paramagnetic defects like E\u2019 centres. A nanofibrous composite PVP mat including SiO2 nanoparticles of 5% mass concentration as well as pure non-woven polymer was characterised by a sharp absorption edge below 320 nm and the absorption range of electromagnetic radiation falling in the range of ultraviolet wavelengths. In addition, an increase in the degree of radiation absorption for a thin fibrous composite layer accompanied by an expansion of silicon oxide nanoparticle concentration from 0 to 5% has been recorded, both with respect to the silicon oxide nanopowder as well as undoped PVP fibres. Using the UV\u2013vis spectra registered for the produced materials and the method presented by the authors in the works , the values of energy gaps (Eg) were specified and illustrated in Fig. 3b. The Eg value obtained for fibrous mats produced from a 15% solution of PVP/EtOH was approx. 4 eV. This result is similar to the result obtained by Rawat et al. , and the shifted value of band gap in the direction of lower energy waves was probably due to the nanometric sizes of the obtained PVP fibres, which formed a thin fibrous polymer mat. For pure amorphous SiO2 nanopowder, the specified value of band gap was approx. 5.5 eV, which is a much more favourable result than the one presented in the work , in which the band gap obtained for amorphous oxide silicones was 9.3 eV. The production of SiO2 nanostructures with a much lower value of Eg, as compared to the one that is currently produced and used, can significantly affect the performance improvement of electronic components used in the production that employs silica. When using a spinning solution containing SiO2 nanoparticles produced with the zol-gel method, a thin fibrous composite PVP/SiO2 layer was obtained, the specified value of band gap of which was equivalent with the value obtained for undoped polymer fibres. Taking this into account, and considering the fact that an increase in the degree. but wait, I have more information to add, just answer with YES", "of radiation absorption for a thin composite fibrous layer is accompanied by an increase in the concentration of silicon oxide nanoparticles from 0 to 5%, it can be clearly stated that the resulting composite material can provide a more efficient absorber of ultraviolet radiation, while maintaining a precise, unchanged range with respect to the electromagnetic waves absorbed by the matrix material.  SiO2 nanopowder was produced using the zol-gel method with a mixture of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Si (OC2H5)), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethanol (C3H5OH) and distilled water. The analysis of the morphology and structure of the resulting particles, carried out based on high-resolution imaging using electron microscopy and an X-ray diffractometer, showed that the resulting amorphous powder is formed of silicon oxide nanoparticles of an average diameter of 23 nm. The size of the obtained particles is especially beneficial in the case of using silicon oxide nanopowder in the biological area for in vitro contrast imaging of cells. Then, using the electrospinning method, thin fibrous polymer and composite mats were produced from 15% polymer solutions of PVP/EtOH, containing SiO2 nanoparticles with a mass concentration of 0 and 5%, respectively. The analysis of the morphology of the obtained fibres, carried out based on imaging of the surface topography of the obtained fibrous mats using scanning electron microscopy, showed a decrease of the fibre diameters from 1164 to 358 nm due to the presence of silica particles in the solution, which potentially increase the efficiency of filters and sensors produced with this type of materials. The carried out UV\u2013vis analyses and the band gaps of the produced materials specified on those analyses prove the obtainment of a pure amorphous SiO2 nanopowder, which is characterised with a band gap of 5.5 eV as well as the obtainment of fibrous PVP/SiO2 materials, which are characterised with improved absorption of radiation in the ultraviolet range, while maintaining unchanged relative to the radiation range absorbed by the matrix material.  \nNow, please generate 10 scientific Q&A (prompts with outputs) using the information in the scientific paper. \nDon't ask very simple questions, like definition questions (e.g. What is XXX).
